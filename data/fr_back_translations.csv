"Instead of an interior scene, it was a winter landscape. The ground was covered with snow-white canvas, not lying softly, but full of bumps and valleys, like a real snow field. The many palm trees and sempergres that had decorated the room, were powdered with flour and sprinkled with tufts of cotton, like snow. Similarly, the diamond dust had been slightly sprinkled on them, and glittering crystal hereceles hung on the branches. At each end of the room, on the wall, hung a beautiful carpet in bear skin. These carpets were for prizes, one for girls and one for boys. And that was the game. The girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys to the other, and one end was called the North Pole, and the other the South Pole. Each player received a small flag that they had to plant on the Pole. This would have been an easy thing, but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes."
"Throughout the dinner, Mrs. Fayre was somewhat silent, her eyes rested on Dolly with an ingenious and uncertain expression. She wanted to give the child the pleasure she wanted, but she had difficulty in developing herself to overcome her own objections. Finally, however, when the meal was almost over, she smiled at her little daughter, and said, ""Dolly, you can go there."" ""Oh! Mother! Dolly was crying, full of sudden pleasure. ""Yes? Oh! I'm so happy! Are you sure you're ready?"" ""I convinced myself to be ready, against my will,"" returned Mrs. Fayre, with whim. ""I confess that I don't like that you are going to go, but I can't bear to deprive you of the journey of pleasure. And, as you say, she would also keep Dotty at home, and therefore, quite, I think I'm going to have to give in."""
"As Roger had predicted, the snow was going as fast as it happened, and two days after their sledding, there was little white vestige on the ground. Tennis was again possible and a big game was going on in the field at Pine Laurel. Patty and Roger played against Elise and Sam Blaney, and the couples were well matched. But the long contested victory finally went against Patty, and she accepted the laughing defeat. ""Only because Patty has not yet returned to his game,"" said Roger; ""this child has been on the list of the sick, you know, Sam, and she's not up to it."" ""Well, I like that!"" cried Patty; ""suppose you bear half the blame, Roger. You see, Mr. Blaney, he's so absorbed in his own love game, he can't play with his former skill."""
"And before the palace, a great garden was surrounded, filled with great fruit trees, grey olives, and sweet figs, and pomegranates, pears, and apples, which bore all the year round; for the south-west wind fed them, until the pear ripened on the pear, figs, and grapes on the grapes, all the winter and spring; and, further on, the beds of cheerful flowers bloomed throughout the seasons of the year; and two beautiful fountains rose up, and ran, one through the garden, and one under the door of the palace, to water the whole city. These noble gifts which the heavens had given to Alcinous the wise; and they came in, and saw him sitting, as Poseidon, on his throne, with his golden sceptre, with steep garments of gold, and in his hand a carved cup, as he had promised to the merchant kings; and beside him he stood, his wise and beautiful queen's pillar."
"There were once three bears who lived together in a house of their own in a wood. One of them was a small medium-sized bear; one was a medium-sized bear, and the other was a large large bear. They each had a pot for their porridge; a small pot for the small medium-sized bear; and a large pot for the large large bear; and each had a chair to sit down; a small chair for the small medium-sized bear; and a medium-sized chair for the medium-sized bear; and a large chair for the large large bear; and each had a bed for sleeping; a small bed for the small medium-sized bear; and a medium-sized bed for the medium-sized bear; and a large bed for the large important bear."
"Hal and Chester found enough time to inventory the general's car. It was a huge machine, and in addition to being furnished in a luxurious way was also furnished as an office, that the general could still be at work while he rushed from one part of the field to the other when the events required his immediate presence. Even now, with threatening betrayal, and whipping along at a formidable speed, General Joffre, probably because of the habit, fell to work sorting papers, study maps and other drawings. For almost two hours the car whipped along at the higher speed, and in the end pulled at the back of a huge corps of troops, which, even in Hal and Chester, could be seen preparing an advance. General Joffre was out of the car before she stopped completely, and Hal and Chester were at his heels."
"Hal Paine and Chester Crawford were typical American boys. Together with the mother of the former, they had been in Berlin when the great European conflagration broke out and got stuck there. Mrs Paine had been able to get out of the country, but Hal and Chester were left behind. Together with Major Raoul Derevaux, a Frenchman, and Captain Harry Anderson, an Englishman, they finally made their way to Belgium, where they arrived in time to take part in the heroic defense of Liege in the early stages of the war. Here, they rendered such a valuable service to the Belgian commander that they were commissioned lieutenants in the small army of King Albert. Both fighting and scouting had proved their worth. After the first Belgian campaign, the two lads had seen service with the British troops on the continent, where they were attached to the general staff of General Sir John French, in command of the English forces."
"On the twenty-second of February 1916, a motor car sailed northward along the French warline, which, for nearly two years, had retained the armies of the German emperor, was trying to gain their way to the heart of France. For months, opposing forces had fought at a draw from the North Sea to the Swiss border, until now, when the day had passed out – it was almost six hours – the hands of time were approaching the hour that was to mark the opening of the bitterest and destructive battle of the war, until that time. It was the eve of the Battle of Verdun. The occupants of the car, as he had rushed northward, were only three more. On the front seat, alone at the wheel, a young man bowed down. He was dressed in the uniform of a British cavalry lieutenant. A close inspection would have revealed that the young man was a young man of eighteen years old, just and good to look at."
"The boys left the capitol and went down the long hill to the main part of the city. As they were knocking on the main business street, Garry noticed the familiar sign of the blue bell of the telephone company. ""Say, the boys, I have an idea. Let's stop here and make long distance calls and say hello to our people. How does the idea strike you?"" said Garry, almost with a breath. ""Ripping,"" cried Phil, while Dick did not wait to make a remark, but plunged through the door, and in a woman made his call. Phil followed the costume, while Garry was waiting, as he was speaking when Dick had finished. This pleasant duty, they went to the restaurant for dinner. Here they did not attract much attention, because their kaki clothes almost resembled uniforms."
"One day he had gone beyond any point he had never visited. He was crossing an open wood, which allowed him to see a great distance. He saw a light breaking through the foliage of the distant trees, which assured him that he was at the edge of a meadow. It was a wide plain, covered with long blue grasses, and enamelled with flowers of a thousand beautiful shades. After walking for a while without a path, moved on the open countryside, and enjoying the fragrant breeze, he suddenly came to a ring carried between the grass and the flowers, as if it had been made by slightly round and round steps. But it was strange – so strange that the white Hawk stopped and looked long and fixed on the ground – there was no way that led to this flower circle. There was not even a crushed leaf or a broken twig, nor the slightest trace of a step, approaching or withdrawing, to find."
"The main men of Virginia believed that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but his mother's influence, to which he used to refer, had so far been sufficient to prevent him from declaring himself openly. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met there, had somewhat weakened the ties between him and his country of origin, and he was in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had both made great efforts to obtain his support, because of his wealth, his position and his high personal qualities. One suggested that the former barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the awareness of having materially helped to acquire this independence, which was to be the birthright of each Englishman, was eloquently illustrated by the other."
"This Pedrarias was seventy-two years old. He was of good birth and rich, and was the father of an interesting large family, which he left cautiously behind him in Spain. His wife, however, insisted on going with him to the New World. Whether or not it was proof of woman devotion — and if it was, it was the only thing in history to his credit — or a reluctance to trust Pedrarias out of his sight, which is more probable, is not known. In any case, she followed. Pedrarias, until his departure from Spain, had enjoyed two pseudonyms, El Galan and El Justador. He had been a bold and fearful rider in his youth, a famous rocker in tournaments at his middle age, and a fierce soldier all his life. His boss was Bishop Fonseca."
"The Emperor was walking nervously up and down the apartment long and low-ceiled, the common room of the public inn in Nogent. Several secretaries were busy around a long table in the centre of the room with orders, reports and dispatches. At one end there was a group of high-ranking officers in rich uniforms whose brilliance was blurred by heavy coats falling from their shoulders and gathering around them, because the air was raw and cold, despite a great fire burning in a large open fireplace. Their coats and hats were wet, their boots and pants were splashed with mud, and in general they were kept and tired. They looked at the Emperor, passing by and ironing, in a dark silence mixed with fear. In carrying them no less than to their face was expressed a certain fierce resentment unawakened, which was burning and becoming more evident when the Emperor turned his back in his short walk without rest, but which was wet as suddenly as under observation."
"The clock in a nearby church struck the hour of two. The escapade was dark. No one was abroad. He plunged into the steps, opened the window and disappeared. No man could move without noise. In the night when he knew that the least noises were magnified. He had made none as he climbed through the back of the house, finally arriving in a room that he considered to be the library. Then, after having listened to nothing and heard, he ventured to turn the button of a side light in a far corner of the room. He was in a large apartment, beautifully furnished. Books and pictures abounded, but they did not interest him, although if he had made a more thorough examination, he could have found things worthy of his attention even there."
"Aunt Abigail was gone, Eleanor was gone. The room was completely empty, except for the bright sun flowing through the small windows. Elizabeth Ann stretched and yawned and looked at it. What a funny wallpaper he was — at the old look! The image was of a blue river and a brown mill, with green willows above, and a man with bags on his horse's back was standing in front of the mill. This photo was repeated many times, all along the paper; and in the corner, where he had not even come out, they had to cut him in the middle of the horse. It was very curious to look at it. She looked at it for a long time, waiting for someone to tell him when to get up. At Aunt Frances' house always told him, and helped him to dress. But here no one came. She discovered that the heat came from a hole in the ground near the bed, which opened in the room below."
"He had never expected to be a king more than you, so everything was all new to him – so new that he had never even thought about it. And as the coach crossed the city, he had to bite his tongue to be sure that it was real, because if his tongue was real, she showed that he was not dreaming. Half an hour before he built bricks in the nursery; and now – the streets were all floating with flags; each window was filled with people waving handkerchiefs and dispersing flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the sidewalks, and all the bells of all the churches sounded crazy, and as a great song to the music of their bells he heard thousands of people shouting, ""Long live Lionel! Long live our little king!"" He was a little sorry at the beginning that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about it."
"Her name was Simpkins, and her cottage was just beyond the courtyard of the church, on the other side of our house. On various military occasions that I noticed on this widow stood at the door of her garden and looked. And after the applause, she rubbed her eyes with her apron. Alice noticed this slight but meaningful action. We are quite sure that Mrs. Simpkins loved the soldiers, and so we felt friends with her. But when we tried to talk to her, she didn't want to. She told us to go with us, to do, and not to disturb her. And Oswald, with her usual delicacy and good reproduction, did the others do as she said. But we should not be repulsed with impunity."
"The children had carefully explored the gardens and outbuildings before being taken and cleaned for tea, and they saw very well that they were sure to be happy at the White House. They thought so from the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine, and white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive smell ever given for a birthday present; and when they had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and very different from the brown grass in Camden Town gardens; and when they had found the stable with a loft on it and an old hay still left, they were almost certain; and when Robert had found the swing broken and jumped out of it and got a bump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had nestled his finger in the door of a hut that seemed to keep rabbits in, if ever you had, they had no doubt whatsoever."
"It was a wet day, so none of the plans to see all the sites in London that can be seen for nothing could be realized. Everyone had thought all morning about the wonderful adventures of the day before, when Jane had held the charm and he had turned into an arch, through which they had walked directly from the present time and the Regent's Park in the country of Egypt eight thousand years ago. The memory of yesterday's events was still extremely fresh and frightening, so everyone hoped that nobody would offer another excursion in the past, because it seemed that yesterday's adventures were enough to last at least one week. Yet, everyone felt a little worried that the others should not think that he was afraid, and currently Cyril, who was really not a coward, began to see that he would not be at all pleasant if he had to think himself."
"The father had been absent to the country for three or four days. All Peter's hopes for the healing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed on his Father, for Father was wonderfully intelligent with his fingers. He could repair all sorts of things. He had often acted as a veterinarian on the beard horse; once he had saved his life when all human help was desperate, and the poor creature was abandoned for lost, and even the carpenter said that he did not see his way of doing anything. And it was the father who set the cradle of the doll when no one else could; and with a little glue and a few pieces of wood and a penknife made all the beasts of Noah's Ark as strong on their pins as ever, if not stronger. Peter, with heroic disinterestedness, did not say anything about his Engine until the father had his dinner and cigar after dinner."
"She seemed different, in a way, and she was sent to bed a little earlier than usual, but he could not sleep long, because he heard the bell tower of the front door and after a man's voice and Helen continued in the little living room under his bedroom. He finally fell asleep, and when he woke up in the morning, he was raining, and the sky was gray and miserable. He lost his tight, tore one of his stockings while he was pulling him, he pinched his finger in the door, and he left his tooth, with water in it too, and the cup was broken and the water came into his boots. There were mornings, you know, when things were going on like this. It was one of them."
"At that time, the queen went out through the door of the palace, and the prince was so dazzled by his beauty, that only for the gold bracelet which he wore on his right arm, under the handle of his silk tunic, he could almost have forgotten Princess Ailinn. This bracelet was made by the dwarfs who lived in the heart of the Scandinavian mountains, and he was sent with other expensive gifts by the king of Scandinavia to the king of Erin, and he gave it to the princess, and it was the virtue of this bracelet, that he who wore it could not forget the person who gave it to him, and he could never again detach himself from the arm by any art or magic spell; but if the bearer, even for a moment, loved better than the one who gave it to him, that moment the bracelet fell from his arm and could never again be attached. And when the princess promised her hand in marriage to Prince Cuglas, she closed the bracelet on her arm."
"Were you ever on the coast of Maine? If so, you know how the rocky shores stretch out now and then clear up in the ocean, and struck the salt waves until they were all in a moss. The ancient ocean must not be so challenged and have its legitimate territory torn from it, without taking revenge after its own fashion. Far into the earth, it sends its arms, crooks and curve and makes its way in the middle of the rocks, and finally fall asleep in a quiet port, where the great pine trees stand by the shore to sing to it a lullaby. In a place like this, the city we will call Fairport was built. Axe in one hand and Bible in the other, tern settlers have found here a house."
"If the nature afflicts in a direction that it often makes amend in another direction, and this dwarf, small as he was, was endowed with a very wonderful spirit. His mechanical ingenuity bordered on the wonderful. When he went to school, he was a general favourite with teachers and students. The first loved him for his softness of disposition, and his remarkable skill in all studies, while the second founded their affection mainly on the fact that he never refused to help any of them in their tasks, while with the pocket knife he was wearing he built toys that were their pleasure. Some of them were so curious and fun that, if they had been guaranteed by letters patent, they would have brought a skill to him and his widow mother. But Johnny never thought of patenting them, although the main support of himself and his mother came from one or two patents, which his father had obtained on inventions, not close to the equal of him."
"On a beautiful summer night in 18, a large heavily loaded steamer moved quickly to the Pacific coast in the direction of San Francisco. It was opposite the Californian coast, only a day's sail away from the city of the Golden Gate, and many passengers had already begun to prepare for landing, even though the whole night and the best part of a day was to intervene so that they could expect to lay their feet on solid lands. It was one of those magnificent steamers that bends regularly between Panama and California. Rather than its full cargo and passengers; but among the hundreds of them, we have to do with only three."
"When Nick Ribsam began to find his missing sister Nellie, he made the most complete search possible. The first house where he stopped was that of Mr. Marston, who, one will remember, was only a short distance from his own house. There, to his disappointment, he learned that their little girl had not been to school that day, and therefore they could not tell him anything. Without waiting longer than giving a few words of explanation, he resumed his trot, and soon after turned to the way to Mr. Kilgore's house. He found that Bobby and Sallie had been at school, but they had nothing to say."
"We three reached the old poplar the following evening between ten and eleven o'clock. Arthur had escaped the investigation by sliding from the window of his room after having offered good night to his parents; and, as the lantern that I was wearing was only lit until we arrived at the tree, we were confident to escape attention. Yet, I looked abruptly, and was greatly relieved not to discover anyone abroad at that hour next to us. Since the treasure was located three feet below the surface, in a sandy ground, I brought only a shovel, while the boys looked at me, one holding the lantern, and the two throwing stealthy glances around me to protect against the earpieces. It would be useless to deny my excitement."
"But in one way or another, Mr. Lathrop was different from the teachers who had preceded him. He never spoke with anger or shout, and his first act when entering the school room was to break the long ""gad"" hackory lying on his desk and throw it out of the window. The next thing, after having called the school to command, was to tell the children with open eyes and away the most entertaining story they had ever listened to. The anecdote also had its moral, woven inside and outside and through its charming meshes was the fabric of a life of heroic suffering, trial and reward. At its conclusion, the teacher told the students that if they were studying and did not break rules, he would be happy to tell them another story the next day, if they remained a few minutes after the hour of dismissal."
"It was early in the avant-garde, Melville having made an early departure from the border town of Barwell, and he was well on his way to his house, which is ten miles to the south. ""Dot,"" as his little sister was called by his friends, had been on a week of visit to his uncle at the colony, the agreement all around being that she should stay there for at least fifteen; but her parents and his older brother rebelled at the end of the week. They lacked the twilight and sun that only Dot could bring into their house, and Melville's heart was delighted when her father told him to go up Saladin and bring her home. And when, on the seventh day of his visit, Dot found her brother-in-law coming after her, and was bringing her home the next morning, she jumped into her arms with a cry of happiness; for although her parents had never suspected her, she was terribly ill and eager to go home."
"Before Fred could finish the sentence, his foot struck an obstruction, and he was hurled up and down from a chasm that had escaped his opinion. He fell with such violence that he was struck meaningless. When he recovered, his torch was extinguished. The smell of the burning resin reminded him of it, and it took him only a moment to remember the accident that had happened to him. For a while, he dared not stir, fearing that he would bend his head on a precipice. He felt his face and hands, but could not detect anything like blood. However, the boy had received a number of severe bruises and when he ventured to stir up acute and pricking pains in his shoulders, neck and legs. ""Thank God I am alive!"" was his fervent ejaculation, after taking his inventory. ""But I don't know where I am or how I can come back."" I wonder what became of it."
"We had to squat for an hour and a half, and the sun went down near the top of the draw, behind us, when Fitzpatrick shook my foot, and he screamed. He made the sign of the birds flying up and pointed the path down to us, so I knew someone was coming around a bend. We barely breathed. We sat down and looked, like two mountain lions waiting. They arrived very quickly, four of them on horseback; we knew the horses. The guys were Bill Duane, Mike Delavan, Tony Matthews, and Bert Hawley. They were laughing and talking because the path we made was clear and they thought we were all pushing straight on, and if they could read sign that they knew the tracks were not too cool. We let them out of sight; then we went straight on the path, and we followed along, so that we wouldn't walk in their tracks and show that we had come after."
"One day, the tiger said, ""I am tired of having my own house, of living anywhere! I will build a house for myself."" That's why the tiger sought a place to build his house. He looked on every hill, in every valley, by every stream and under every tree. Finally, he found a place that was right. It was not too high or too low, not too close to a stream and not too far from one, not under too thick trees and yet not far from trees out in the warm sun. The tiger said, ""I'm going to build my house here. The place is all ready for me, there is not much undergrowth here."""
"The children wondered that nothing worse than harsh words fell on their part, and were somewhat relieved that the next question related to Bob, not to their actions. ""You say he didn't come home?"" said Coomber. ""I haven't seen him since he went with you to Fellness. Didn't you just come from there?"" said his wife, shyly. ""Of course I have, but Bob should have been back an hour or two ago, because I had something to do in the village."
"Katie Haydon went to London, ma'am. Did she tell you on Sunday?"" The speaker was Esther Odell, who could only think of the good fortune of her school and, meeting her teacher later in the week, rushed to communicate the important news to her. Miss Eldon seemed surprised and a little disappointed, because she had heard of an excellent opening for Kate, in the nursery of a lady not far from there, who needed a bright and intelligent girl, able to help the nurse sometimes with only one child, and also to learn to wait for the young ladies who were growing up."
"When Josie arrived at her destination, she went to the small hotel that the village was boasting and, hiring the only room in the house with a private bath, she got comfortable for the moment. She needed to sleep before she could get involved in the adventure she was planning. A hotel or board is a good place to take information and Josie wanted to gather some information before she proceeded. The owner of the hotel was a sieve of gossip and in less than twelve hours Josie had not only had a good night's rest but had learned several things that she considered important. The host was a man of generous proportions and a strong and emphatic expression, with which he gave voice to a perpetual complaint that he had had had about the high cost of food and the low price of the board."
"He sang long summer days and the music of the waters that were beating on the shore. He sang from the moonlight and from the light of the stars. All the wonders of the night, all the beauty of the morning, were in his song. ""Dear south wind,"" said the Great Spirit, ""Here are some beautiful things for you to bear, you at your summer house. You will love them, and all the little children will love them."" At these words of the Great Spirit, all the stones before him were remembered of life and rose on multicoloured wings. They were moving away from the sun, and the wind from the south sang to them as they went. Thus the first butterflies came from a beautiful thought of the Great Spirit, and in their wings were all the colors of the brilliant stones he did not want to hide."
"This is the story of how the tail of the swallow became forked. One day, the great Spirit asked all the animals he had made to come to his lodge. Those who could fly came first: the robin, the blue bird, the owl, the butterfly, the wasp and the skylight. Behind them came the chicken, flattering his wings and trying to have trouble standing. Then came the deer, the squirrel, the snake, the cat and the rabbit. Finally came the bear, the beaver and the hedgehog. Everyone travelled as quickly as possible, for everyone wanted to hear the words of the great Spirit. ""I called you together,"" said the great Spirit, ""because I often hear you grow and fry. What do you want me to do for you? How can I help you?"" ""I don't like to hunt so long for my food,"" said the bear."
"The eagle was angry, but he did not say, and the two birds came down to the earth together. The eagle was very small, but she cried even more avidly than the others, ""Let's choose the bird that flies the highest,"" for she said to herself, ""They think the owl is wise, but I am wiser than him, and I know which bird can fly the highest."" Then the birds tried their wings; they flew high above the earth, but one by one, they had to return to their homes. They soon saw who could fly the highest, for when all the others had returned, there was the eagle that rose higher and higher."" The eagle is our king, cried the birds on the earth, and the eagle cried out with great happiness."
"The winter was coming, and the birds were flying away to the south, where the air was warm and they could find berries to eat. A little bird had broken its wing and could not fly with others. It was alone in the cold world of frost and snow. The forest seemed warm, and it was making its way to the trees as well as possible, to ask for help. First, it came to a tree of birch. ""Beautiful tree of birch,"" he said, ""my wing is broken, and my friends fly away. ""Can I live among your branches until they return to me?"" ""No, indeed,"" replied the birch tree, drawing its beautiful green leaves. ""We, from the great forest, have our own birds to help. I can't do anything for you."" ""The birch is not very strong,"" said the little bird to himself, ""and it might not be easy for her to keep me."
"The reeds murmured the angry words of the poplar to the royal bee, and she said, ""I was going to guide my swarm to the poplar, but now I will drive the tree out of the forest."" Come, my bees, come. The bees flew hundreds on the poplar. They threw all the leaves and all the branches through. The tree was driven out of the forest, over the meadow, over the river, and again the angry bees flew after it and threw it over and over again. When they came to the rocky places, they left it and returned to the land of flowers. The poplar never returned. Its bright green leaves had become whited by fear, and since that day they trembled as they did when the bees drank them and chased the tree out of the forest."
"As they were tired, they didn't have time to go to sleep before hearing a bear call ""Ugh! Ugh!"" in the woods. They got up and ran out of the woods, and just before they came to the bottom of the hill, they saw a beautiful little lake in front of them. They were no longer afraid, for there in the water was something radiant and bright.""It's our own star,"" they said, ""and it came down to us."" They never thought of looking at the sky over their heads. It was enough for them that the star was in the water and so close to them. But was it called them?"
"Once upon a time there was a small grain of wheat that was very proud indeed. The first thing he remembered was to be very crowded and blocked by a large number of other grains of wheat, all living in the same bag in the attic. It was pretty dark in the bag, and no one could move, so there was nothing to do but sit down and talk and think. The proud little grain of wheat spoke a lot, but didn't think so much, while his next neighbor thought a lot and spoke only when he was asked questions that he could answer. He said that when he thought a lot, he could remember the things he seemed to have heard a long time ago."
"Jem hid her face on her arms and wept as if her heart were breaking. She wept until her eyes were heavy, and she thought that she would have to go to sleep. But, just as she thought she would go to sleep, something fell into the fireplace and lifted it up. It was a piece of mortar, and he brought a good amount of soot with her. She leaned forward and looked upward to see where he was coming from. The chimney was so wide that it was quite easy. She could see where the mortar had fallen to the side and left a white spot. ""How white against the black,"" said Jem; ""it's like a white brick among the blacks. What a more chic place a chimney is! I can see a little bit of the blue sky, I think."""
"He did not forget anything. He lived by looking at all things with great clear and joyful eyes. On his mountain cliff, he never heard a pale or implausible word or knew the existence of a lack of conviviality or base in thought. As soon as he was old enough to go out alone, he wandered on the great mountain and feared no storm or wild beasts. The lions and their chamoisés approached him and flogged on him as their kind had flung on the young Adam in the garden of Eden. He had never crossed his mind the thought that they were not his friends. He did not know that there were men who killed their wild brothers. In the immense courtyard of the castle, he learned to mount and perform great exploits by force. Because he had not learned to fear that he could do anything. He grew so strong and beautiful that he was as tall as a young man of sixteen years, and he was already as a giant."
"The birthday had to be celebrated with great festivities. The school room had to be decorated, and there had to be a party. The gift boxes had to be opened with a big ceremony, and there was a gleaming party in Miss Minchin's sacred room. When the day arrived, the whole house was in a whirlwind of excitement. How the morning passed nobody knew quite well, because it seemed that there were such preparations to be made. The school room was lined with holly garlands; the offices had been moved, and red blankets had been placed on the shapes that were arranged around the room against the wall. When Sara entered her living room in the morning, she found a small labyrinth package on the table, attached in a piece of brown paper. She knew it was a gift, and she thought she could guess where he was coming from. She opened it very tenderly."
"If our conversation about the exciting subjects of fertilizer and aphids seemed in his serious absorption to approach the emotional and tender he interfered immediately. He commanded my attention. He perched on the nearby branches and tried to distract me. He flattered and called me with chirps. His last resource was always to fly at the top of the twig of an apple tree and start singing his most brilliant song in his most exciting tone and in an affected way. Of course, we were obliged to listen and talk about him. Even the face of the old apple beaten by Barton's time crept in smiles. ""He does this to make us look at him,"" he said. ""That's why he does it. He cannot remain unnoticed."""
"When they came back from the cemetery, Le Rat kept silent all the way. He thought about what had happened and what had happened in front of him. In fact, he thought above all that there was nothing in front of him – nothing. The certainty of that gave his sharp face, lined with new lines and the sharpness that made him look pinched and hard. He had previously only one corner in a naked garland in which he could find nothing more than a roof running over his head – when he was not turned in the street. But, if the police asked him where he lived, he could say that he lived at Bone Court with his father. Now he could not say it. He could not get along very well on his crutches, but he was rather tired when they reached the corner in the street leading in the direction of his old haunted ones. In any case, they were haunted that he knew, and he belonged to them more than he belonged to elsewhere."
"The next morning, a breakfast earlier, Hamilton began the trip to his enumeration district, stopping at the office to talk for a while with his friend the supervisor, and receiving his good luck vows before he left. The mare was a pleasure, being well in rhythm, and the horseman from whom Hamilton had bought the animal had taken a lot of trouble to get him a saddle tree that would fix him, so that the boy would enjoy every minute of the promenade. He reached the first point of his district about an hour, and after an early dinner began to work. The place was a small village, containing about forty houses. The population work, as Hamilton had planned, proved relatively simple, and the first house he visited was a fair sample of the largest number of those he was smoking throughout the month. As a typical example, he was impressed on his memory. He began by the house where he had eaten dinner."
"One night, returning from a hard day, during which he had not only mounted his fire patrol, but had also spent a few hours rolling large rocks in a stream to prevent him from washing a path if a fresh one came, he found a large part of the people in his camp. There was a former social science teacher of the old regime, his wife and little girl, a guide, and a sumptuous outfit. Although the door of the corral of Wilbur was locked and painted on her ""Property of the U.S. Forest Service"", the teacher had ordered the guide to crush the door and let the animals in. Wilbur was angry, and did not bother to hide it. ""Who turned these horses into my corral?"", he asked. The professor, who was wearing golden glasses over a very dirty and tired face, replied, ""I am responsible for this party, and this was done on my orders."""
"""Let me look, Billie,"" and Donald stretched out his hand for the glass of field through which Broncho Billie looked down from the top of the Real del Monte on the plain of Quesco, through which the Pachuca River snakes. ""Maybe I can do who they are."" Billie put the glass back without a word and stood waiting, while Donald carefully looked at a body of horsemen — twenty or more in numbers — who had stopped by the railway that connects the small town of Pachuca to the city of Mexico. ""They are not soldiers, that's for sure,"" Donald commented after carefully inspecting the horsemen for a few minutes. ""That's what I thought,"" from Billie. ""They look like a group of vaqueros to me; but what would a crowd of fifty cowboys do in a country where the only cattle are goats?"""
"There were only a few passengers on the deck, for it was quite cold, and it was now beginning to darken, and we went down. Shortly after the bell of dinner sound, and I was happy to hear it, for I had the appetite of a horse. There was a first-class dinner, always as many different dishes, all at the top and bottom of the table, which had ridges running in the direction of length, under the tablecloth, to prevent the plates from slipping, if a storm were to rise. Before we finished with dinner, the shelves over the table began to throw a good deal, or rather the ship was rolling and the shelves kept their seats, so I knew we had to be good enough at sea, but I didn't expect it to be so hard, because the day had been beautiful and clear."
"The Sea Lion was an American submarine, but it was not built along the usual naval lines. It was told that it looked more like a pleasure yacht built for underwater work than any other. It was not the writer's purpose to enter into a minute description of the boat. It was provided with a gasoline engine and an electric motor. It was not very spacious, but its appointments were very beautiful and expensive. There were machines to make clean air, as it is common to all submarines in his class, and the apparatus for the production of electricity was modern and efficient. Each compartment could be closed against each other chamber in case of damage to the hull. Pumps designed to expel water taken into the hold to bring the boat to the bottom were powerful, so it seemed to sink and lift as easily as a bird on the wing. At the higher speed, it would be about twenty miles an hour."
"The others were looking at him closely. They were guessing something of the nature of what was going to pass through Ned's mind, because Jack and Teddy were following his gaze up the uneven coast. Jimmy had the glasses again, and was busy looking at the blur on the distant horizon, which all had agreed to be smokesome hovering near the water. Perhaps half-believed the fanciful suggestion made by Teddy, with reference to Captain Kidd, and wildly hoped to discover a positive sign that would sparkle this fairy tale with truth. All the previous adventures that had gone down himself and the chums would sink into total insignificance, could they go home and show evidence of having made such a romantic discovery up there in Hudson Bay."
"Four boys were standing in the pilot house of a robustly built and beautifully equipped motor boat that was rolled and thrown by waves in the Gulf of Mexico in front of a south wind. Large fog benches were rolling in front of the wind - fog so thick that it was not possible to see the length of a boat in front. The boys were all dressed in oil skin suits under which they could have seen neat khaki Scout uniforms. If their jackets had been exposed, one could have distinguished medals that led to membership in the beaver patrol, the American Scouts. Other badges indicated that the boys had won the distinction and were entitled to honours in know-how, rescue,talking and signage."
"With trembling hands, the boy took the chips out of Jack's hand. Carefully scrambling the tiny flame of any currents of air, the boy held the point of one of the thin pieces of wood on the eruption. In a moment he had caught fire. As he climbed the buckle, the flame gradually jumped from one piece of wood to the other until the whole handle was inflamed. The dance light played on the three faces and sent a glow into the surrounding darkness. Harry put the burning shavings on the floor, where the fire was soon transmitted to the largest piece of wood that Jack had used to whistle. As the boys saw that the material of the fire was assured, they looked first at each other, and then let their eyes wander around the apartment. ""Bonnety, the rats do not seem to be afraid of the fire!"" cried Jack, pointing towards a horde of rodents crawling around the place."
"It had been difficult for Harry, when his father's business called him to England, to give up all the friendships and associations of his childhood. It had been difficult to leave school, to tear up, by the roots, all the things that connected him to his home. But as a scout, he had learned to be loyal and obedient. His parents had spoken with him very frankly. They had understood how difficult it would be for him to accompany them. But his father had made him see how much it was necessary. ""I want you to be close to your mother and myself just now, especially Harry,"" he said. ""I want you to grow up where I can see you. And, further on, it won't hurt you to know something about other countries. You'll have a new idea of America when you've seen other countries, and I think you'll be a better American for that."
"In the morning, they woke up to the two friends with the sound of the night before the bugs, apparently right in front of their window. Together, they ran out of bed, ran to the window, wide open as it had been all night, and looked outside. Not far, in a small park, one of those for whom the city of Amiens is famous, they saw a range of white tents that they had not seen the previous night when they had gone to bed. Already the camp was troubled; even as they looked at the soldiers were all around. And as soon as he was, they saw a scout riding a bike, talking to the watchman who challenged him, and waiting. In a moment an officer came out, the scout greeted, and his salvation was made as stiff and serious as it had been given."
"She did not cry long, however, for she was as courageous as she could be expected from a princess of her age. After a good cry, she rose up, and shook the dust of her pants. Oh, what an old dust it was! Then she wiped the eyes of her hands, for the princesses did not always have their handkerchiefs in their pockets, no more than other little girls I know. Then, like a real princess, she decided to go to work wisely to find her way back: she walked in the passages, and looked in all directions for the staircase. She did so, but without success. She resumed the same ground without knowing it, for the passages and doors were all the same. Finally, in a corner, through a half-door open, she saw a staircase."
"When, in the winter, they had their supper and sat around the fire, or when, in the summer, they stretched out on the border of the rocky stream that was crossing their little meadow near the door of their cottage, coming out of the great whiteness often folded in the clouds, Curdie's mother would not rarely lead the conversation to a particular person said and believed to have been very concerned about the last question of events. This character was the great-great-grandmother of the princess, whose princess had often spoken, but that neither Curdie nor her mother had ever seen. Curdie could indeed remember, although he already looked more like a dream than he could have seen if she had actually taken place, how the princess had once led her to what she called a beautiful room at the top of the tower, where she passed through all that had to be called that? – the behavior of presenting him to her grandmother, speaking to him now and now to him, when he saw nothing but a naked gloomy, a pile of strawberry."
"Of course, not all boys are full of tricks, but the best of them are. That is, those who are the quickest to play innocent jokes, and who are constantly looking for a chance to make roman screams, are the most able to turn themselves into first-class businessmen. There is a boy in the seventh neighborhood that is so amusing that sometimes it hurts him. He is the same boy who, shortly afterwards, wrote a note to his father and signed the name ""Daisy"" to him, and held the old man on a corner for two hours while waiting for the girl."
"Meanwhile, one of the best customers of the grocery store, a deacon of the church, had entered and sat on the counter, over the needle, and the man from the grocery store came in with the coal, the boy pulled the string, and came out of the door and spilled over a basket of rutabagas, while the deacon came down from the counter with his hand tight, and the anger in all the details, and told the man from the grocery store that he could whip him in two minutes. The man from the grocery store asked what was the problem, and the deacon drove out the source from where the needle of the water came through the counter, and as the boy passed through the street, the deacon and the man from the grocery store was rolling on the floor, the man from the grocery store trying to hold the deacon's fists while he explained about the needle of the water, and that it was intended for the boy."
"Uncle Ike was sitting in his room with a bath gown, and his tall, tall, barefoot in a hot water bath, in which a dry mustard had been sifted, and on a table next to him was a hot lemonade pitcher, which he was trying to drink, as he was fresh enough to come down his neck without burning his throat. His head was hot, and he had obviously taken a severe cold, and sometimes he was moaning, when he was moving his body, and placing his hand on the small of his back. His pipe and tobacco were far away on the fireplace, although he could feel them, and the smell so satisfying for him when he was well, almost made sick, and when the boy with a red head came into the room the first thing the old man said was: ""Put this pipe and terback out of the room, and put it in the woods. Your uncle Ike was not enjoying his terbacker very well,"" and the old man made a face, and looked like he was on a rough boat in a time."
"The kangaroo female is surely a wonder, and seems to be built on different planes and specifications of any other animal, because she has a fur pocket on her stomach, like a vest, that she wears her young ones. When the babies are afraid they make a quick move towards mom, the pocket opens, and they jump out of sight, like a gopher entering her hole, and the mother looks around her as innocent as possible, as well as to say: ""You can search me. I don't honestly know where these children have gone, but they were here no more than a minute ago."" And when the fear is above both heads approach the top of the pocket, and the old man grunts, as much as to say: ""O, come, there is no danger, and let your mom have a little rest, because she is nervous,"" and then the babies come out and run around the cage, and sit on their back feet and look wise."
"Dad should have believed the scientists, because they knew everything about their affairs, but after the scientists had laid down the cowboys began to put on pa. They told him that about a hundred miles north, in a valley in the mountains, the dinosaur still existed, alive, and that no one would dare go there. A cowboy said that he had a flock of cattle in a valley up there once, and the group entered a group of dinosaurs, and the first thing that he knew a great dinosaur reached his neck and picked up a rudder, raised it in the air about 80 feet, as easy as a derrick would have taken a dog home, and the dinosaur swallowed the whole rudder, and the other dinosaurs each swallowed a rudder. The cowboy said before he knew that his whole group of bastards was swallowed whole, and they would have swallowed him and his horse if he hadn't swallowed a rudder."
"Next year, it would be Dorothy's turn. This year, his party had simply consisted of taking his cousins by car. A similar tour had been planned for Ethel Blue's birthday, but the giants had plans for them and the young people had had to give way to them. Dorothy had come to spend the afternoon and have dinner with his cousins, however. She lived just around the corner, so her mother was willing to let her go despite the rallies, because Roger, Ethel Brown's older brother, would be able to bring her home so short a distance, even if he had to make a way along the way. The snow was so beautiful that they didn't want to do anything in the afternoon but the look on her. Dicky, Ethel Brown's little brother, who was the ""honorary member"" of the United States, had come in wanting to be entertained, and they had opened the window for an inch and brought in some of the huge flakes that developed into the glass and crystals."
"""Good afternoon, son. I stopped to tell you that these pumpkins are ready for you. If you jump now, we can go and pick them up again."" ""Good enough!"" cried Roger. ""I'll tell Mother that I'm going. She can have a message for Grandma,"" and he moved over the door and overturned the steps. In a minute, he was still outside and got in the car. ""Where are the girls this afternoon?"" asked Mr. Emerson, as he was throwing in the clutch and started to the periphery of Rosemont where he had landed enough to allow him to do some farming."
"The great marooned car started in such a perfect rhythm that Cora Kimball, the good driver of the Whirlwind, barely heard a sound of his mechanical maneuvers. The perfection of his movement was similar to the very music of silence. Hazel Hastings was simply sumptuous in the barrel—she had spread all the available wheels, but there was still a lot of unoccupied space on the luxuriously cushioned ""throne"". It seemed a shame to passers-by that two girls were alone that morning in the beautiful machine—so many of those feet would have been happy to occupy empty seats. Directly after the Whirlwind came another car—the little silver Flyaway. Here too were two girls, the twins Robinson, Elizabeth and Isabel, otherwise Belle and Bess. Chelton's people were used to seeing these girls in their cars, and a motor race was now seen as a daily occurrence."
"Joe Dale was an honour for the family. Although he was only a boy in the tenth year, he had as much virility as many other good in adolescence. He was tall, and of a dark type, while Dorothy was not quite tall, and had fair hair; so that, despite the difference in their age, Joe was often considered to be Dorothy's big brother. Roger was just a pretty baby, so runaway and with such gold curls! Dorothy had begged not to have them cut until his next birthday, but the boys, of course, thought seven years very old for long hair."
"Dorothy and Cologne were picking up berries this morning, while Tavia fled to a place where she said she could get the best fruit, better than any other fruit they still had. She went back behind the big barn, then ran behind the cooler, and then she felt apples, ripe apples. ""There are apples of harvest here, somewhere,"" she said. ""I just have to find them.""From the tree to the tree, she would sneak out until she went out into the way that ran in the next field. ""It's a road,"" she said. ""And there's a man."" Glanking around to see if she could discern Dorothy or Cologne, Tavia had a sudden thrill of terror.""I didn't know I had gone so far,"" she thought, ""and this man comes from that way."" Something familiar about how the stranger came to herself drew attention."
"""Oh, my dear,"" said Polly, the next morning, trying to have breakfast for the sick of the inevitable muzzle; ""everything is as bad as it can be! They can never eat that; I would like to have an ocean of toast!"" ""Too much bread in the bucket, Polly,"" said Mrs. Pepper. She looked worn out and worried; she had been standing almost all night, going back and forth from Ben's bed in the loft to the little Agitated and frantic Phronsie in the large four-poster in the room; for Phronsie did not want to enter the crib. Polly had done her best to help her, and had rubbed her eyes with diligence to stay awake, but she was not used to it, and her little healthy and tired body was succumbing — and when she woke up, shame and remorse filled her heart."
"It was over. Phronsie had been swept away, a vision of beauty, up to the cave; the dragons had roared their strongest, and the gallant knight had covered himself with glory in the brilliant rescue of the princess; the little page had won the hearts of all the ladies; Mr. King had applauded himself, especially at the deliverance of the prologue, when ""I cry mercy to you, gentlemen, and fair ladies,"" shouted; the musical efforts of Polly and Jasper in the ""Wait"" between the two acts were over, and the crowded house, in every possible sense, had been delighted with all things from the beginning to the end. ""Phronsie, Phronsie, they call you,"" enthusiastically murmured Polly, in the green room. ""Come, princess."" The head dragon held his hand. ""Dear, see the flowers!"" ""They cannot be for me,"" said Phronsie, standing up, ""Polly did all the work, they hold his hand."""
"Joel sat down at a straight bolt as he could, being piled between a big man and his kind friend, and directed so and in this way his tears all the way, and before one could hardly think twice, the pair of black horses and the jingling harness and the big car stopped in front of the small brown house, and the doctor stopped on the steps so vividly that Joel had to run with him, until they were, with Grandma Bascom wandering around in search of some herbs that dried up in the corner of the wood, and Polly always held David's hand as he was lying on the pile of grain bags. And in five minutes the new doctor had done all the examination, and Davie was sitting, his head on Polly's shoulder; and no bones were broken, and all the trouble was the fear of the shock of the fall."
"""We'll go there on the first day, Polly,"" said Jasper, the Louvre, ""I mean. Well, we're in Paris!"" And then it was all confusion, because the guards were throwing the doors to the compartments, and people's currents were gathering on the platform, in what seemed to be an inextricable confusion in the middle of a very small noise. And it was only that Polly was driving in the big taxi with his part of Mr. King's ""family"", as he called it, through the wide avenues and boulevards, interspersed with occasional squares and gardens, and the beautiful bridges here and there across the Seine, slipping under the sun, that she could realize that they were really in Paris. And the next day they were going to the Louvre. And Adela, who had to stay a day or two at the hotel with them before returning to his school, was indeed very important."
"If she looked at both sides of the road, she didn't dare to think what she would say if she really saw Clem, Polly was moving. But not a glimpse of the figure of the great girl met her eyes, and finally she turned to a door and ran on the small path of the door. Mrs. Forsythe saw her through the window that opened on the piazza. ""Why, Polly Pepper,"" she cried, ""what a pity that Clem didn't find you! She went to your house."" ""Oh, I know, I know, Polly dressed, with scarlet cheeks. Don't try to talk,"" said Mrs. Forsythe, ""you're all out of her breath. Come in, Polly."" ""Oh, I can't. I mean I would like to see Clem,"" Polly whispered, with a terrible fear, now that she was about to find her, what she had to say."
"In another moment, however, the girl's attention was drawn to the appearance of a figure that seemed suddenly to spring out of nowhere and to stand close to Ashton's house. It was almost dark, and yet Betty could distinguish a young man, grossly dressed, not wearing a coat, with his coat neck facing upwards and a cap drawn at her eyes. Without being afraid, she was curious and interested. Why did the man have to behave so strangely? He was now passing in front of the house, and then he turned around and came back, not once but several times. Clearly, he had not observed the girl at the window. Finally, however, he abandoned, and Betty thought that she saw him disappear behind the closed cottage of the O'Neills. She was not having fun anymore, she was preparing to leave the living room. He was too cold to stay there any longer. Moreover, studying the familiar objects she had so loved only made the thought of their surrender more painful. Betty once again faced her three candles."
"A huge place, he held rows on rows of other bedbeds with white nurses passing through them. When they spoke or when the patients spoke Mildred could rarely guess what was said, as she knew so few words of Russian. Yet, she had little difficulty with her care, because the ways of evil were universal and she had already seen so much suffering. Now the hospital room was half-shadow, but it was never clear or ventilated as the American nurse thought. The quarters of the hospital were only part of the fortress, a large room, like a barracks that had been quickly transformed into a shelter for the wounded. The long stone chamber had only four small windows barely larger than portholes and a certain distance from the ground. They opened with difficulty and were protected by heavy iron bars."
"Although very few people knew, the prince, coming to the chapel, had encountered an accident. A young lady of rank, whose duty was to transport him to the chapel, had been so busy organizing her train with one hand, that she stumbled and dropped him. She picked him up – the accident was so light that it was not worth talking about. The baby had become pale, but he was not crying. No one knew that something was wrong. Even if he had moaned, the silver trumpets were loud enough to drown his voice. It would have been a shame to let something disturb such a day. Such a procession! Heralds in blue and silver; pages in scarlet and gold; and a group of little girls in white dazzling, wearing baskets of flowers, that they put all the way in front of the child and the nurse, finally the four and twenty godfathers and godmothers, splendid to look at."
"For a long time he lived in the toy cabinet or on the floor of the nursery, and no one thought much of him. He was naturally shy, and was made of velvet, some of the most expensive toys rather snobed him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down on all the others; they were full of modern ideas, and claimed they were real. The model boat, which had lived two seasons and had lost most of his painting, took on the tone of them and never missed an opportunity to refer to his rigging in technical terms. The rabbit could not pretend to be a model of anything, for he did not know that there were real rabbits; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was completely obsolete and should never be mentioned in modern circles."
"Already the leaves had begun to turn scarlet and gold on some hedges, and even in the forest, where the boys began to go for the early nuts. Early in the morning, there was a decided tang in the air that insinuated the frost. There was a considerable discussion in every time a group of boys gathered, about the prospects of a regular winter to the old, and many hopes along this line were indulgent. There was a good reason for this, Chester being most favourably located to allow his young people to enjoy ice sports when the bitter weather came."
"The life of a pelican seems to be very lazy, if not very pleasant. The man, always on the eve of turning the habits of the animals on his own account, observing as a good fisherman the pelican is, often the capture and tame, and makes him fish for him. I have heard of a bird of this kind in America, which was so well trained, that he would be in command to leave in the morning, and return at night with his pocket full, and extended to the highest; part of his treasure which he has degorged for his master, the rest was given to the bird for his trouble. It is not credible what these extraordinary pockets will hold; it is said, among other things, that a man's foot with the boots on was found in one of them. Pelicans live in herds; they and the cormorants sometimes help one another to make a living. The cormorant is a kind of pelican, of dark color: it is sometimes called the crow of the sea."
"She moved to the breakfast room the next morning, a little ahead of Miss Rose, who had stopped to talk to Adelaide, when Arthur came to run behind her, having just come through a side door of the garden, and grabbing her size, he said, ""Thank you, Elsie, you are a very good girl! She is a wonderful girl! I have tried her on the pond. But I must not be a gift; you must let me pay you back when I receive my allowance."" ""Oh, no, Arthur, it would spoil everything,"" she replied quickly; you are very welcome, and you know that my allowance is so great that half of the time I have more money than I know how to spend."" ""I would like to see the time that would be the case with me,"" he said, laughing."
"Mr. Horace Dinsmore was remarkable enough for his conversational powers, and Rose, who had always found him a very entertaining companion, wondered a lot about his silence in this particular evening. She waited in vain for him to start a topic of conversation, but as he did not seem willing to do so, she made a long attempt herself, and tried one subject after the other. Finding, however, that she had only been answered in monosyllables, she became too silent and embarrassed, and warmly wished for the relief of Elsie's presence. She had proposed to call the child to accompany them as usual, but Mr. Dinsmore replied that she had already had enough exercise, and he would prefer that she stay at home. They had walked somewhat, and coming to a rustic seat where they had often rested, they had sat. The moon was shining softly on them, and all the nature seemed haunted and still."
"It was in the middle of school hours that Ion's car came up the avenue, and Philippe Ross, raising the head of the slate on which he was leaning for the last half hour, rose up hastily, threw his pencil and rushed out of the room, without paying attention to Miss Fisk's question: ""Where are you going, Philippe?"" or his command: ""Come back immediately: it is quite contrary to the rules for the students to leave the school room during the recitation hours, without permission."" Indeed, he had reached the foot of the stairs before the last word left his lips; she was very slow and precise in speech and action, while her movements were fastest. ""What now in this emergency?"" solocates the governess, thinking unconsciously with a loud voice. ""Misss Gertrude Ross, turning to a nine-year-old girl whose happy blue eyes were briming with fun, ""follow your brother at the same time and inform him that he must not return to such an act."""
"A quick walk of five minutes brought them to the shore of the lake, a tiny one, barely a quarter of a mile of circumference, not very deep and the water so clear that the bottom of the pebbles could be seen distinctly; gold and silverfish, too, that slide here and there; while a pretty boat painted lying on the edge of the water, bent gently into the morning breeze. Eddie slipped the scene with a shout of joy; the little girls danced on gleefully, vi applauding his hands and eagerly asking if they could enter the boat. Papa looked at his watch, ""Yes, there will be time for a row; a journey around the lake. Enter, all of you, and I will take the rams."" Vi was quite ready and Eddie delivered it gloriously, then turned and offered his hand to Elsie."
"The Ion family was back at home after their summer on the coast of New Jersey. It was a delicious morning early in October: the drops of dew on the still green grass of the carefully guarded lawn shone in the rays of the newly raised sun; the bright waters of the lacet also, as, stifled by the breeze, they were slowly breaking around the bow of the pretty boat moored at the small dock; the gardens were gay with brightly reflected flowers, the beautiful trees in their autumn robe. But although the doors and windows were open, the gardener and his assistants at work in the field, it seemed a strange calm about the place: when the men spoke to each other, he was in subjugated tones; there were not, like the other days, sounds of small feet running on her and there, nor of presty or childish laughter."
"The house was very high, and from this window one could look to the north and south on the wooded mountain, the hill and the valley, or to the east on the majestic river and its distant shore. The closer view was well guarded, but not extensive, of the grounds; a flower garden and a lawn with a winding pavement leading to the hill by a gradual climb. It was a pleasant place to sit even on a sunny summer morning, because a large tree partially shaded the window without significantly obstructing the view, and it was there that the master of the house was usually found, at this time of day, with Evelyn, his only child, near his sides. They were there, sitting now, sitting at a table covered with books and papers, he occupied in the drawing plans of a building, also with his lessons."
"Max is still a cadet at the Naval Academy, continuing his course there in a way entirely satisfactory for his father and his friends. The captain thinks that no man has ever had a brighter son, better than his first-born, or a more likely to do good service to his country in his chosen profession. It sometimes seems difficult, a sad thing to do without his boy, but he never really regrets that Max made the choice of naval service as his work of life. However, he regretted that Max could not go to Chicago to visit the World Exposition, where they were all very interested. Some of the ties had attended the dedication ceremonies of the previous autumn, and almost all talked about going to the formal opening, appointed for the first May; among them were Grandmother Elsie, his father and his wife, Captain Raymond and his wife and family."
"There, the cook, astonished by his strength, first gave him a hearty meal, then offered him a good service under himself, with food and lodging for his salary. Havelok accepted this offer, and was installed as a cook boy, and employed in all the lowest offices – carrying wood, water, grass, logs, rising, gathering, carrying – and in all, he showed himself a wonderfully strong worker, with a good temperament and unshakeable sweetness, so that all the little children loved the young great, sweet and fair hairs who worked so quietly and played with them so joyfully. When the old Havelok tunic became worn out, his master, the cook, took pity on him and gave him a new suit, and one could see how beautiful, great and strong a young boy of this cook was, and his fame spread far into the city of Lincoln."
"Time is a very strange thing, dear readers. We don't know where it comes from or where it goes;—but we don't know anything about it in fact, except that there is a small moment of what it calls the present, that we have as it was in our hands to make use of—but beyond that we can give no account of, even this little moment. It is up to us to use, but not to understand. There is one thing in the world, however, just as wonderful, and just as common, and that is the wind. Has it ever struck you how strange it is that the strongest thing in the world should be invisible? The pleasant breezes that we feel in the summer and the harshest explosions that we feel in the winter in England are not as strong as you will say: but I am speaking, in addition to those winds called hurricanes that occur in the islands of the West Indies, and in other parts of the world."
"Flora was a good girl, and her parents were always happy to do whatever they could to please her, and to increase her happiness. They were very lenient parents, and since they had a lot of money, they could afford to pay well for a ""good time."" Yet, they were not weak and stupid in their indulgence. As much as they loved their little girl, they did not give her pies and cakes to eat when they thought such items would hurt her. They did not let her sleep in bed until noon because they loved her, or allowed her to do something that would hurt her, either in her body or in her mind. Flora always went to church, and to Sunday school, and never wept to stay at home. If she had cried, it would not have made any difference to her father and mother, whether she loved her or not."
"From his early childhood he had paddling in Lake Champlain. His father had a small place, composed of ten acres of land with a small cottage; but he was still under a mortgage, as he had been for twenty years, although the note had passed through several hands, and had been renewed three times. John Wilford was not a very sagacious or energetic man, and had not distinguished himself in the race for wealth or fame. He wanted to be rich, but he was not willing to pay the price of wealth. His place was a short distance from the village of Port Rock, and John Wilford, at the time he had bought the land and built his house, had established a ferry, which had been, and was still, his main means of support; for there had been considerable travels between Port Rock and Pointville, on the Vermont side of the lake."
"Sophie was the daughter of a wooden worker near Amsterdam. She was her only daughter, and even though he had nothing to say against the English sailor who had won her heart, and who was the main owner of the ship that he commanded, he cried out that she should leave her native land; and he and his three brothers decided that she should always carry her old house in her memory. So they prepared as a wedding gift a facsimile of the house in which she was born and raised. The furniture and frame were similar in each individual, and it was only necessary to insert the brick and plaster when he arrived. Two of his brothers made the journey into the Good Venture, and they put the frame, beams and floor together, and ensured that the house was completed on the strip of land that William Martin had bought on the bank of the river."
"The change at school was made very quickly. The squire usually executed his resolutions while they were hot and, the same day after his conversation with his wife on the subject, he went first to the vicar and arranged for the clerk's retirement, and the white issue in his place; then went to the school house, and informed the master of his intention. The master had waited for his dismissal, since Ms. Ellison had spoken to him the previous day; and the news that the stable had given him was a relief for him. His emoluments, as clerk, would be smaller than those he had received as schoolmaster; but although he would not be able to perform the latter's duties for much longer, because he thought that the boys had too much for him, he would be able to perform the very easy work involved in the clerk's work for many years to come."
"His life was spent mainly among the artists, and like them in class, he touched loose and easy clothes. He was wearing rotating collars with a tie and velvet jacket, without care. He was one of those men whom his intimates declared to be capable of doing anything he chose, and who chose not to do anything. He had never distinguished himself in any way in Harrow. He had kept a right place in his forms while he was moving to school, but he had done so rather of the natural ability than of the study. He had never been in the eleven, although it was the general opinion that he would certainly have had a place in her if he had chosen to play regularly."
"In a moment, all were at their posts. The bar was placed on the yacht, and it paid on the opposite pitch to the one on which it had been before sailing. As soon as the jib was filled, Tom gave two vigorous blows with his axe on the hawser, and, as he raised his hand for a third, he separated. Then came the sharp rattle of the chains as they ran around the holes of the hawser. The sail was raised and laid at home, and the seabird was again en route. Tom, as before, called the ship of the bow. Several times, she was near the rocks, but each time she avoided them. A cry of joy arose from everything on the deck as she passed the last piece of white water. Then she cut down and bore Jersey. Tom now had time to go down and take care of her passengers. They consisted of the captain and two sailors, the only survivors of those who had been on deck at the time the ship struck."
"When Gregory returned, the spirit of the merchant was taken. He had concluded that the story he had heard was true. The way it had been told was convincing. The man was undoubtedly a gentleman. There was no mistake in his way and in his conversation. He had quarreled with his family, probably about his marriage; and, as many had done, he had difficulty keeping his head above the water. His wife had been ordered to a warm climate, and he was willing to do whatever would keep her there. It would certainly be a great advantage to have someone who could act as a clerk, as a matter of urgency; of course, his knowledge of the language would add a lot to his usefulness. It was certainly not a matter of taking a man without reference, but the advantages more than counterbalanced the disadvantages. It was not likely that he would stay with him for a long time; but in any case, the fact that he was taking his wife with him would ensure his stay, until he saw something much better elsewhere."
"The young page was strongly and solidly built. His dress was English, but with a little blend of Norman fashion. He wore tight leg blankets, a garment that looked somewhat like a blue cloth blouse girded by a belt at the waist, and falling into folds at the knee. On his shoulders hung a short orange coat with a hood. On his head was a hat with a wide edge that was turned down and projected into a pointed shovel at the front. In his belt was a small dagger. He wore light yellow leather shoes attached by bands on the steps. As he ran the steps of the palace, he came into sharp contact with another page that had just turned the corner of the street."
"The good woman had made her a pretty little red hood, which became so much the little girl, that everyone called her Little Red Chaperon. One day, her mother had made her cheese cakes, and said to her, ""Go, my child, and see how your grandmother does, for I hear that she is sick; carry some of these cakes, and a little pot of butter."" Little Red Chaperon went straight with a basket full of cakes and pot of butter, for her grandmother's house, which was in a village a little far away from the town where her mother lived. As she was crossing a wood, which was on her way, she met a great wolf, who had a great spirit to eat it, but dared not, for fear of a few woodcuts, who worked near them in the forest."
"Now came the autumn. The leaves of the forest became yellow and brown; the wind took them to dance, and in the air it was very cold. The clouds hung low, heavy with hail and snowflakes, and on the fence stood the raven, shouting, ""Crack! Croque!"" for only cold; yes, it was enough to be cold to think of this. Poor little Duckling certainly did not have the good time. One evening, the sun was just lying in its beauty, there came a whole herd of great, beautiful birds out of the bushes. They were dazzling white, with long and flexible necks, they were swans. They shouted a very special cry, spread their glorious wings, and flew away from that cold region to warmer land, to beautiful open lakes. They climbed so high, so high! and the moche Duckling felt strangely as he looked at them."
"When the two friends reconciled, they looked at the boy, and saw that he had a slight wound in his foot, and that they could not walk; and while they thought of what they should do, they spied on the grass called ""Doctor's Nakasé"", which was just sprouting; they swung a little in their fingers and applied it to the part. Then they drew boiled rice from their lunch box and offered it to the little one, but it showed no sign of desire to eat; and they smote him gently on the back and petrized him; and, as the pain of the wound seemed to have soothed, they admired the properties of the grass, when, opposite them, they saw the old foxes sitting beside them looking at a few piles of straw of rice."
"The priest, smiling at this speech, replied: ""Being as I am, I have no desire and no desire. Happy as I am to hear your good intentions, there is nothing I can ask you to do for me. You do not need to feel anxiety because of me. As long as I live, when winter comes, you will be welcome here."" The badger, hearing this, could not hide his admiration for the depth of the benevolence of the old man; but having so much to be grateful for, he felt bad not to be able to recover it. As this subject was often renewed between them, the priest finally, touched by the goodness of the heart of the badger, said: ""Since I shaved my head, renounced the world, and abandoned the pleasures of this life, I do not want to gratify, but I must possess three rhyos in gold."
"""Where does he come from? What is his purpose? Who can he be this old man?"" whispered the crowd that was wondering. Meanwhile, the venerable stranger, the stick in hand, continued his lonely walk along the centre of the street. As he approached the soldiers on the way, and the roll of their drum approached his ear, the old man rose to a higher mine, while the dwindling age seemed to fall from his shoulders, leaving him in a gray but intact dignity."
"One night they saw a star brighter than all the others. Its location was very far to the south, near a mountain top. For many nights they saw it, until it was long doubted that the star was as far in the sky from the south as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved that the star was only a short distance away, and close to the tops of some trees. A number of warriors were accused of going to see what it was. They went, and when they returned, said that it seemed strange, and a little like a bird. A committee of wise men was called to investigate, and if possible to determine the meaning of the strange phenomenon. They feared that it might be the omen of a catastrophe. Some thought it was a precursor of good, others of evil; and some thought it was the star whose ancestors spoke of a terrible war."
"Many years before, the captain's wife had been a child herself, and had laughed to see the village mummers act the egg of peace, and had been very happy on Christmas night. Happy, even if she had no mother. Happy, although her father was a severe man, very fond of her only child, but with an obstinate will that even she dared not defeat. She had lived to counteract her, and he had never forgiven her. It was when she married the captain. The old man had a prejudice against the soldiers, which, in his opinion, was quite right for her daughter to sacrifice the happiness of her future life by abandoning the soldier she loved. Finally, he gave her his choice between the captain and his own favours and money."
"It is not often (from a fairy tale) that wants to change the whole course of his life is granted as quickly as the desire of mine was. The post of the next morning brought a letter from Mrs Arkwright. They were staying in the south of England, and had seen the Bullers, and had heard all their news. It was an important budget. They were going abroad once again, and it had been arranged between my two guards that I had to stay in England for my education, and that my house had to be — with Eleanor. Matilda had to go with his parents; for the benefit of his health, he was hoped. Aunt Theresa sent me the most kind messages, and promised to write to me. Matilda sent us both his love."
"These shrimps are strangely beautiful when you see them at home. And this one seems to be doing in the Great Aquarium; however, I suppose, it is a lot like seeing terrestrial animals and birds in zoos — a bad imitation of their free life in their natural state. Yet, there is no other way to see and come to know these wonderful ""seamen"" so well, unless you can go, like Jack Dogherty, to visit them at the bottom of the sea. And although I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who has not seen the Aquarium to visit it as soon as possible, let me describe it for the benefit of those who cannot do it now."
"The sun was shining in a cloudless sky, and no shadow was lying on the mountain, and all day they looked and waited, and finally, when the birds were singing their farewell song to the evening star, the children saw the shadows scrolling out of the light, spreading out on the side of the mountain, and darkening the purple of the heather. And when the top of the mountain slipped like a golden spear, they stared at their eyes on the line between the shadow and the sun. ""Now,"" said Connla, ""the time has come."" ""Oh, look!"" said Nora, and as she spoke, just above the shadow line, a door opened, and through her gates came a little piper clothed in green and gold. He descended, followed by another and another, until they were new in all, and then the door fell."
"Enda took the helmet, the robe, and the spear, and it was not long before he came to the sedative benches where his little boat was waiting for him. When he went up into the curragh, the moon rose above the mountains. He picked up until he reached the cabin, and moored the boat to the door, he put the water robe and the crystal helmet, and took the spear into his hand, and jumped on the side of the curragh, and descended until he touched the bottom. Then he walked without worrying where he was going, and the only light that he had had was the light of the shimmering moon, which descended as weakly through the waters as if it were through the stifled glass. He had not gone far when he heard a horrible whistle, and just before him saw what he thought was two flamboyant coals."
"When she was by the water, she waved her wand, and in a second thousand ships, shining like glass, drew the lake from under and bowed their bows against the shore. The queen and Cuglas walked in one, and when they were sitting two harps of fairies took their place in the bow. All the other ships were soon filled with fairies, then the queen waved her wand again, and a purple silk awning arose on the boat, and silk awnings of different colors on the others, and the royal boat departed from the shore followed by all the rest, and in each boat sat a harp with a golden harp, and when the queen waved her wand for the third time, the harps struck the trembling chords, and to the sound of delicious music, the boats slipped over the sunny lake."
"He woke up at the break of the morning, and saw that he was almost at the edge of the water. He looked to the sea, and saw the island, but nowhere could he see the edges, and he began to fear that he had to take a bad way in the night, and that the island before him was not the one he was looking for. But even while he thought he heard fierce and angry sniffs, and, coming quickly from the island to the shore, he saw the swimming and the edges. Sometimes their heads and their manes were only visible, and sometimes, rising up, they got up half out of the water, and, striking her with their hoofs, threw him in foam, and threw the white jet into the sky."
"Then the young Etin, for it was the name of Margaret's eldest son, took his mother's hand and called his six little brothers, and together they passed through Elmond's wood as quickly as ever they could go. Maybe the mother was leading the way, it could be that it was a little bit of a chance, but soon they had left the green wood behind and stood on an open heather. And there, in front of them, stood a castle. Margaret looked and Margaret smiled. She knew that she was standing again in front of her father's door. She took three rings from her pocket and gave them to her eldest son. ""Give one,"" she said, to the doorkeeper. ""He is proud, but so he sees the ring, he will open the door and let you in. ""Give another to the butler, my little son, and he will show you where you are going."
"King Horn smiled, and his voice was sweet as he answered, ""There is no need to take the gold combs of your hair or to change your white robe for a less beautiful one. It is your wedding day, and I came to ask for my bride."" And King Horn threw aside the old torn robe, and Princess John saw that under the rags the horn of Hynde was clothed in a royal rank. Then, throughout the palace, the news spread: ""Hynde Horn has returned, the horn of Hynde has returned, and now he is king of his own country."" And on that day, King Horn was married to the beautiful Princess John, with the blessing of his father, and in the midst of the joys of the people."
"Another day, the goshawk left the birch and lit up on the door, a little closer to the window of the lattice where the beautiful lady to whom he had been sent sat. Again, he sang his song. Loud and clear he sang it first, loud and clear so that all could hear. Gently and sweetly he sang it after, sweet and sweet so that only Lord William's lady could take the note of love. And always, strong or sweet, the last words of his song were these: ""Your true love cannot come to you here."" Then the lady said to her eighty young girls, ""Eat, my happy young girls, eat and drink, for the feast is widespread."
"She stopped in the bedroom, near the queen's bedroom, and waited for her to feel sure that the royal pair was sleeping well. Then, stumbling slightly on the end of the foot, she flew into the bedroom, where, as she had guessed, the king and the queen slept. She passed through the bedroom, quiet as any mouse, and reached the table of the toilet. There lay the king's golden comb, and beside him the little pearl knife, the king's wedding gift to her queen. Back, Margaret stumbled, always on the tip of the foot, in the room at the front, and stopped, with her breath coming quickly."
"The three friends began to converse openly and familiarly together. First, the Knight asked a few questions about the forest, but the old man did not want to say much about it; the least, he said, was that it was appropriate to speak of such things at nightfall; but, on the concerns of the house, and their own way of life, the old men spoke easily; and were happy when the Knight told them his journeys, and that he had a castle near the source of the Danube, and that his name was Lord Huldbrand of Ringstetten. In the middle of their speech, the stranger often observed a noise outside a small window, as if someone struck water against her."
"In the meantime, the distant thunder gave notice of a shower at hand, and just as we reached Polley's tavern, the rain flowed in torrents. It was soon over, the cloud passing in the direction of the turn towards Providence. A few moments later, a respectable man in a chair stopped at the door. The man and the child in the chair, having aroused a little sympathy among the passengers, were asked the gentleman if he had observed them. He said that he had met them; that the man seemed perplexed, and worried about the way to Boston; that he was driving at high speed, as if he expected to come out of the storm; that the moment when he had passed a thunderbolt was clearly broken on the man's head and seemed to wrap both the man and the child, the horse and the car."
"On the way Mother Mitchel arranged in her head the plan of the monument which was to immortalize her, and considered the means to execute her. As for its shape and its size, it had to be as exact a copy of the capitol as possible, since the king had wanted it; but its external crust should have a beauty entirely to it. The dome must be decorated with sweets of all colours, and surmounted by a splendid crown of macaroons, spun sugar, chocolate and candied fruits. This was not a small matter. Mother Mitchel did not like to waste her time. Her battle plan once formed, she recruited on her way all the little pastrymakers of the country, as well as all the little children of six years who had a sincere love for the noble vocations of cullion and apprentice. There was much, as you can imagine, in the country of Greedy; Mother Mitchel had her choice."
"There had been a very special time in Colchester during this month of October 1705. First, the 13 (Old Style), an unprecedented early date, had come a ""clin of terrible cold,"" which lasted three days. This was followed by two days of phenomenal softness. The river had frozen during the ""clining of cold,"" and the ice had melted during the warm days, until the 19th, it broke and was preparing to go to the sea. In the night of the 19th, a colder explosion had descended than the original. This had stopped the broken ice, piled it in all sorts of fantastic forms, and confused it until it looked like a rough Alaskan glacier. After the cold wind had come a strong snowstorm."
"The Pilgrims said that one day was not enough, so they planned to have a whole week's party. This was most likely in October. The great Native American chief, Massaoit, came with ninety of his bravest warriors, all gayly dressed in deer, feathers and fox tails, with their faces rubbed with red, white and yellow paint. As a sign of rank, Massaoit was wearing a bone rope and a tobacco bag around his neck. In his belt he was wearing a long knife. His face was painted red, and his hair was so dormed with oil that Governor Bradford said that he ""was looking grievously."" Now, there were only eleven buildings throughout the village of Plymouth, four log warehouses and seven small log houses; so the Native Americans were eating and sleeping at the door."
"The new barn had completely exhausted the income, and there would be no income until January 1st; but it was necessary to have a turkey for Thanksgiving, and there were Miltiades. To catch Miltiades became the problem of the house, and the inventor of the sky put wonderful traps for him, who caught almost everything except Miltiades, who easily avoided them. Eph used to go out every day before breakfast and hunt Miltiades, but he could as well have pursued a position of government. Turkey despised him, and grew only wilder and harder, until he had a lean and hungry look that would be ashamed Cassius. The day before Thanksgiving it seemed that there would be no turkey dinner at Todd's, but here Fisherman Jones entered the breach."
"In those days, there were none of the thousands of improvements in the maintenance work that have taken place since — no soil and spices prepared and soft herbs; everything entered our hands in the rough, and in bulk, and the reduction of it in a state of use was considered one of the appropriate work of childhood. Even the salt that we used in the kitchen was rock salt, which we were required to wash and dry, and the book and sieve before it became suitable for use. At other times of the year, we sometimes murmured at these works, but those who were supposed to inaugurate at the great Thanksgiving feast had always entered enthusiastically."
"Donald looked at him, and, of course, there were fripons coming out of the ground in all directions. He thought they looked like small croquet hoops, but he made no comment, for fear of offending the old gobbler. But he felt that he had to say something to make the gobbler believe that he was not afraid, so he pointed out, in a disorderly way: ""Should break one and make a wish."" The ghost of the old gobbler frowned, pulled himself away and pronounced a ghostly whistle that seemed to cut off the air."
"In less than a week, all the complexity of the affairs in this small island city was completely changed. Both Massachusetts and Maryland applicants ceased their unfounded claims for at least some time. A Hartford treaty settled the contentious issue of boundaries, and the Maryland governor declared ""that he did not intend to interfere with the Manhattan government."" Moreover, Sewackenamo, leader of the Native Americans Esopus, came to Fort New Amsterdam and ""given the right hand of friendship"" to Governor Heer, and by the exchange of gifts a peace treaty was ratified."
"When the hubbub downstairs started the four Rover boys were in their adjacent rooms partially undressed and in the middle of a few impromptu boxing matches, one taking place between Andy and Jack and the other between Randy and Fred. ""There, my boy, how do you like it?"" cried Andy, because, dancing around, he managed to slap Jack's naked shoulder. ""Finally, child! Very well!"" replied the young Jack. ""But not half as good as that,"" he continued, and, with a sudden spring, he landed a blow on Andy's chest and another on his shoulder that sent Tom's son halfway on the bed. ""Hurrah! One man down! Now for the other!"" exclaimed Fred, and managed to put several blows in succession on Randy's shoulder."
"Most of the cadets had their dormitories on the second floor of the building; each room was held by four to eight students, and was both bright and clean. The rules of the Putnam Room were similar to those in West Point, and each student was supposed to keep his clothes, books and other property in perfect order. Each had a bed, chair and clothing closet on his own, additional closets having been introduced into the rooms for that purpose, and each was allowed to use his or her safe in addition. Each cadet had to take his or her turn to keep the room in order, although the dormitories were regularly swept and cleaned once a week by the servants. As before, the Rover boys were placed in a room, and in that room also came Larry Colby, Fred Garrison, and George Granbury. The apartment was at an angle of the building, and next to it was occupied by Songbird Powell, Tubbs, Hans, and three other cadets. Between the two rooms was a door, but it was supposed to be closed, and was locked."
"At first, Sam and Tom demurred to enter the cave, which looked dark and prohibitive. But Dick insisted that he go forward, and rather than be left behind them, they went. ""We were going to light a kind of torch,"" said the Elder Rover. ""Did I bring matches?"" ""Yes, I brought a pocket,"" replied Sam. ""I didn't know, but what we would like to build a campfire this noon.""""We want one now – to dry our clothes,"" said Tom. ""Let's go get the drier of the sticks.""That they did, and they entered the cave, they made a good-sized fire."
"""We don't know how dangerous these explosions can become,"" said Captain Dale, ""and Colonel Colby thinks it's best for you to stay here where he's relatively safe. ""Even if that's the case, we can have some big shells coming in this way."" The Hasley Shell Loading Company was located on the opposite bank of Clearwater Lake for a number of years before the opening of the war in Europe. But at that time, it had been only a small concern, employing but a few men. One year after the outbreak of hostilities, however, the factory had been expanded, and now, since the United States' entry into the war, the workers' force had been doubled again and many additional buildings had been erected, some along the lake and others in the hills beyond. A spur of the railway had also been built at the factory, and on these were many cars, all painted to show the dangerous nature of the cargo they were intended to carry."
"So it happened that Worcester was captain of the house of Biffen, and also of the team of ""footer"" of Biffen. My own opinion was that poor old Worcester would have given a lot to be out of a house such as that of Biffen, and I know that he totally despised himself to have in a moment of inexplicable weakness consented to be a permanent conduct to the dreadful crowd of Biffen on the Acres. He died a thousand dead after every (usual) annihilation. Worcester and Acton had nothing in common, and except that they were in the same house and the same form, they would probably not have come to terms of head."
"Erley Chase! The best place around, one of the largest properties in the county, and Marianne suggested that he take it! Let him take away from his fifty-pound house in this majestic pile! The suggestion terrified him, and yet why not? His lawyer assured him that he could afford it; his children grew up, and he had their future to consider. He thought of his handsome boys, his fried daughter, and proudly decided that nothing was too good for them; he looked into the future, and saw the children of his children rule in his place, and the name of Chester honored in the country. Erley Chase was therefore bought, and little Mrs. Chester brought it, as we have seen, to his own great contentment and to that of the trades people with whom she cared; and over the course of a few months, the family settled in their new home."
"There were two thoughts that filled Frank's mind most of the time. The first was that he was going to give on everything he had to leave his aunt's house. The other was a wish that his father was soon writing to him, telling him, as he had promised, that he had decided that his son could leave Tipton and go to the boarding school. What with the persistence of his survised parent, the anxiety about his sick father, and the suspense about his own future movements, Frank did not have a very happy time with him. He felt a good business as a boy locked up in a prison. His aunt used his authority severely."
"The team to play in any game has always been put on the noteboard at the foot of the stairs in the senior block one day before the date of the fixation. The first two and second fifteen had matches on Thursday of this week. The second played a team brought back by an old Wrykinien. The first had a scratch match. When Barry, accompanied by M'Todd, who shared his study at Seymour and rarely left him for two minutes at the end, passed by the scoreboard on the quarter at eleven intervals, it was to the second fifteen list that he turned his attention. Now that Bryce had left, he thought he might have a chance to enter the second. His only real rival, he considered, it was Crawford, of the School House, who was the other wing three-quarters of the third fifteen. The first name he saw on the list was Crawford. He seemed to be written twice as great as one of the others, and his own was nowhere to be seen."
"Everyone who has moved to the world knows that Ring's Come-one Come-all Up-to-date Stores. The main office is in New York. Broadway, to be exact, on the left you go down, just before you get to Park Row, where the newspapers come from. There's another office in Chicago. Others in St. Louis, St. Paul, and across the seas in London, Paris, Berlin, and, in short, everywhere. The particular advantage on Ring's Stores is that you can get everything you want there, from an engine to a macaroon, and rather cheaper than you could get it anywhere else. England had so far been badly supplied with these practical paradises, the one in Piccadilly being the only existing specimen."
"Dunstable was a young man of ideas. He saw much more possibilities in the routine of life in Locksley than the majority of his contemporaries, and from time to time he made use of these possibilities in a way that caused a considerable sensation in the school. In the ordinary way of school work, however, he was not particularly brilliant, and suffered accordingly. His main enemy was his master trainer, Mr. Langridge. The quarrel between them had begun on the arrival of Dunstable in the form of two terms before, and had continued since. The balance of points was with the master. The staff had ways to mark what the school did not have. This story really begins with the last day, but one of the summer quarters. It happened that Dunstable's people were going to make their annual migration to Scotland that day, and the director, approached on the subject both by letter and in person, saw no reason why — the exams being completed — Dunstable should not leave Locksley one day before the end of the term."
"The life in St. Austin was made somewhat hollow and heavy for Pillingshot by the fact that it was shaved by Scott. Not that Scott was the Bully Beetle-Browed in any way. Far from there. He showed a benevolent interest in the well-being of Pillingshot, and sometimes even made his Latin verses for him. But the noblest natures have defects, and Scott was no exception. He was as a humorist, and Pillingshot, with his rather serious vision of life, was perplexed and displeased by this. It was by this defect in Scott's character that Pillingshot became a detective. He toasted muffins at the study fire one night, while Scott, sitting on two chairs and five cushions, read ""Sherlock Holmes"", when the prefect deposited his book and fixed it with a serious eye."
"On a trip, we often meet people of different nationalities and languages; we also encounter incidents of various character, some sad, others joyful and instructive. One of these characters I saw recently on the cars. The train went west and the time was at night. In a train station, a little girl about eight years old came on board, carrying a budget under her arm. She then started a face-avid examination, but all were strange for her. She seemed tired, and placing her budget for a pillow, she was preparing to try to get some sleep. Soon the conductor came to pick up tickets and tickets."
"I have here a knife. It was given to me by a friend, a pledge of his affection and esteem, when I boarded the steam in Manila, the Philippines Islands, to return to the homeland. All these years since, the knife has been on my study desk, the daily teaching. What lessons does this knife teach? First of all the knife tells me of Force. The most important part of this knife is what I call the backbone. It is the main part of the knife to which all the blades are attached, as well as the handle of polished beads. It would be a weak and useless knife had no spine."
"Once upon a time the owner of a very large garden planted a tree, the fruit of which was very precious and of great value to all those who ate it. For a time the tree grew and bore many good fruits. But the owner of the garden had an enemy secretly sowing seeds of weeds and all kinds of weeds and bushes, so that they spread over the whole garden and killed the good tree that the master had planted. The enemy also persuaded many workers in the garden to neglect the good tree, to let the weeds and weeds grow around it and thus prevent its growth. Thus, the once precious fruit of the good tree became wild and watered, no better than the trees of the enemy that grew around it."
"It was impossible for two boys to keep such an important discovery for themselves, and the hangar was soon filled with a greedy crowd, all eager to see the mysterious prints. The Triple Alliance gained a new reputation as the initiators of the plan by which the disclosure was made, and it was unanimously decided that the matter should be brought back to Mr. Blake. The crusader Acton and Diggory, but seemed rather inclined to doubt their history. ""I think,"" he said, ""you must be wrong. I hope the piece of blown cotton, and the foot marks must have been there before. I do not see what is in the hangar that should make the value of anyone while he enters; moreover, if the door was locked, the thief must have broken it, and you would have seen the marks."""
"The big five-seater car arrived on time at three o'clock and passed the young people and all their belongings to Warren, where their arrival caused a lot of satisfaction. ""You saved us from a difficult situation,"" said Ms. Glyn Williams. ""I don't know how to thank you. Was it not Babbie's smart mind to think about it?"" ""We never forgot how you made a scene here once!"" said Tudor. ""Can't do it myself to save my life! And Gwen says the same thing. Oh, she's there! I was looking for you, Gwen! Here's the Ramsays, and Talland."" The Gwen who advanced to shake hands was so different from their old knowledge that the girls thought they would hardly recognize him."
"Gwen returned to school feeling rather tamed and sober. The bad cold and facial pain, after her adventure in the snow, had seriously interfered with her plans for the holidays, and she had not accomplished the half that she intended to do at the time. Dick Chambers had been lying in bed with an attack of rheumatism, when she had hardly seen anything of him, and quite throughout the month had kept her disappointments. She returned to her office in the fifth almost happy to start a new term, although she knew that many difficulties were waiting for him."
"The little Sara Crewe never came in or out of the house without having read this doorplate and reflected on it. At the age of twelve, she had decided that all her sentence was up because, first, she was not ""Selection"", and in the second she was not a ""Young Lady"". When she was eight years old, she had been brought to Miss Minchin as a student, and she had gone with her. Her daddy had brought her all the way to India. Her mom was dead when she was a baby, and her dad had kept her with him as long as he could. And then, finding the warm climate made her very delicate, he had brought her to England and left her with Miss Minchin, to be part of the Select Seminary for Young Ladies. Sara, who had always been a sharp little child, who remembered things, was picking up by hearing him say that he did not have a parent in the world he knew, and therefore he was obliged to place her in a boarding school, and he had heard very loudly about Miss."
"The great day of the boat race between Riverport and Mechanicsburg opened with a clear sky, which made the hearts of the hundreds of young people in the two cities of the Mohunk River happy. Every day, the Husky crew of the city at the top of the river had been busy practicing; and all sorts of disturbing rumours were present among the shyest boys and girls in Riverport as to the amazing speed they had shown. But when those who had faith in the ability of their own crew to come forward heard these tales, they only laughed, and screamed, as if they did not feel fear. As for the ability of their rivals to ""circle"" around the boys of Riverport, did they not realize that these stories were circulating with ardour in order to make them count the race lost even before it was started?"
"The more Fred thought about it, the more he was convinced that Buck and Billy would long find Masterson's lonely farm, which was off the main road. They had let him go in a direction that was really at right angles to the shortest track there. But perhaps Buck knew another road. And after all that was not his business. The evening had now settled seriously. There would be a moon later; but the darkness began to close the last lights of extinction of the day. Fred felt quite ""chipper"" as he himself had expressed. As long as he could not make sure that his serious result had accompanied his fall in that hole, and the exposure that followed the error. His muscles had returned to their former state, he was running as easily as ever; and he thought he was in a splendid state."
"""You really want me to understand, Brady, that it is not you alone, but all the older boys — today's students and residents — wanting your own free will to devote the half-day next Saturday to passing on the plants of this poor man from his house to Brickland at the sale of Rookwood?"" ""Yes, sir, that's what we want to do."" ""H'm! Well, the proposal credits you, and you could certainly use your time far worse than in execution. I don't think it would be fair for me to refuse your request. Mr Anderson, I'm sure, will be willing to help you and advise you, if necessary, but as the idea is your own, I should love you, as much as possible, to do it for yourself."" ""Thank you, sir,"" said Jack, and withdrew."
"On Monday evening, the head of the school reported to Dr. Rowlands that the offender had not been found, but that a boy was very generally suspected, and for reasons that seemed plausible. ""I acknowledge, he added, that as little as I know of him, it seems to me very unlikely that he would do so."" ""I think, he suggested, that the best way would be for you to have a regular trial on the subject, and to hear the evidence. Do you think you can be trusted to pursue the investigation publicly, with good order and fairness?"" ""I believe, sir,"" said Avonley. ""Very well. Warning, ask the whole school to meet in the boarding room tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock, and see what you can do among you."" Avonley did as the doctor suggested."
"The room shared by Glyn Severn and Singh was one of a series, small and particularly comfortable, in the new annex, the doctor had built specifically for the conference room and the dormitories when his establishment began to increase. The comfortably furnished room was just enough for two narrow beds and the usual furniture; and as soon as the two boys had entered, Singh rushed to his chest drawers, unlocked one, took a second group of keys to what he was wearing in his pocket, and was then crossed by a sea portmanteau standing in a corner, when Glyn, who was looking very thoughtful and abstract, followed, and as Singh knelt and threw the travel briefcase, placed his hand on the boy's shoulder. ""What are you going to do?"" he said soon. ""Look only two or three things that have no room for the drawer."""
"""I have important news to communicate,"" started the old Dut dryly, after typing the bell for the beginning of the afternoon session. Dick and some of his friends rose up quite placidly, because they knew what the news was. ""All football fans at Grammar Central school,"" continued the director, ""are invited to meet in the usual field immediately after the school closes. The goal is to form a league and organize games between the three Grammar schools in Gridley. I will add that I am glad that our young men show so much interest in athletics. To show my pleasure, I will add that if one of the young men in this school are so unhappy that to run controls this afternoon that they will keep them after school, they will be able to serve the checks tomorrow. First class in geography! For the next twenty minutes, boys in this class are asked to remember that football is not a geography!"""
"About six weeks after the beginning of half, while Tom and Arthur were sitting one night before supper, at the beginning of their verses, Arthur stopped suddenly, and looked, and said, ""Do you know anything about Martin?"" ""Yes,"" said Tom, taking his hand from his back hair, and delighted to throw his Gradus ad Parnassum on the couch; ""I know him quite well. He is a very good guy, but as crazy as a hater. He's called Madman, you know. And he's never been so good at getting all sorts of rum stuff on him. He tamed two snakes last half, and used to wear them in his pocket; and I'll be bound he had hedgehogs and rats in his closet now, and nobody knows what else."" ""I would really like to know him,"" said Arthur; ""He was next to me today, and he had lost his book and he looked at mine, and he seemed so kind and sweet that I loved him a lot."""
"After the Easter holidays, several new boys came. One of them was called Edward Ellis. He had a remarkably calm and softened way. The general remark was, that he seemed to be vagabonded. He was certainly out of mind. He spoke very little, avoided making friends, or, in any case, confidants, and rarely entered any of our games. He seemed willing to suffer some amount of intimidation, even small people, and if he was hit, he never hit again. He had already been at school, but he never said where. Probably, however, he had been there for some time, because he was already fourteen years old, but not big or strong for his age. With such a disposition and habits as I described, of course, he could not be a favourite of anyone; at the same time, he could not be said to be positively hated."
"The next morning, after the first hours of school, Dr. Wilkinson kept Reginald while he was following the creek for breakfast, and led the way into the classroom, where, after closing the door, he sat down, and sent Reginald to approach him, thus opening his investigation. ""I would like to know, Mortimer, how this case started yesterday evening: it seems, of all I can say, to have been a most imprudent attack on your part, but as there is often more than there is on the surface, I will be happy to hear what you have to say by exhausting your wild conduct."" Reginald has very deeply coloured, and I let his eyes fall under the piercing gaze of his master. ""Am I to conclude from your silence that you have no excuse to do?"" asked the doctor in a tone of sadness and indignation mixed; ""and I am to believe that, according to a little insult, you left your cousin's mood so uncontrolled?"""
"The girls who had joined Kathleen's society were almost now in a state of tension; once a week they had to meet in the career; once a week, no matter how long, in the night, they had to find themselves in this sequestered place; they knew that if they were discovered, they would have great chances of being expelled from school; for, although they were learned by day, the integrity of conduct was essential for them to retain their place in this great school, which gave them such a liberal education, in some cases without cost, in all other cases with very small ones. One of the great ideas of the school was to encourage courageous actions, disinterested acts, the nobility of mind."
"I am old, and I am running, and I am good for nothing now; but many times I find my thoughts wandering at this distant day; and remembering all that has happened to me since this troubled moment, I humbly hope that my life has not been one to dishonor the good character with which I came out into the world. I was young at the time, very young – scarcely a month. Watches, however, as everyone knows, are much earlier in their childhood than human beings. They usually settle into business as soon as they were born, without having to spend much of their time either in the nursery or in the school room. Indeed, after my face and hands have been well cleaned, and a new bright coat was put on my back, years ago I found myself again called to submit to this operation which is such a terror for all mortal children."
"The doubts of the Classics were justified. The Moderns did not accept their victory in the elections with a sweetness that augured harmony for the next half. On the contrary, they had carried out this difficult acrobatic exploit known as coming out of their heads, with jubilation. For many terms they had moaned under a feeling of inferiority, partially imagined but partly well founded, in their relations with the rival side. The Classics had aired themselves, and, worse, proved their right to give them. At its beginnings, the modern side was not ""in him"" at Fellsgarth. Its few members had learned to consider themselves as an order of creation quite inferior to that of the students of the former foundation, and had accepted the position with humility."
"All the other games, the home game, and even the game against the city, were played in the fields, in the presence of the whole school. But once every two years, Templeton went to war in drags and omnibuses against his hereditary rival, and powerful was the excitement with which the expedition and his equipment were considered by each boy who had the glory of his school at heart. Seventy boys, and only seventy, were allowed to form the invading army, whose selection was a question of intrigue and emulation for weeks before. But for some broad rules, which eliminated at least half of the school, the task could have been even more difficult than it was. For example, all juniors, to the eternal anger and indignation of the Den, were excluded."
"Smith and I had much more than a dinner to discuss this morning as we rested for twenty minutes of our office work. He did not boast, nor built absurd castles in the air; but he made no secret of the fact that he was once in the business he wanted to do, and he expected with confidence enough that he would do it. I would have wanted to feel half as sure of myself. In any case, I was encouraged by Jack Smith's enthusiasm, and I went back to the end of my twenty minutes at my office with all the intentions of distinguishing me from my work. But somehow everything was so new, and I was so curiously willing, that I could not stop my thoughts wandering a good deal, or to listen to the constant fire of little speeches that were going on among my colleagues."
"The rowers were too tired and enraged to speak much, and the journey down was silent and dark. They heard, one kilometer from the house, the bell of the school ringing for the call, and groaned inwardly when it ceased, and they knew that their names were called and not one of them there to answer. Parson alone made every attempt to maintain the draconian spirits of his crew. ""Never fear. We will pay them, you see. And if they bring us back we will only get impotences. The beasts! I would like us to run over them and drown them all! I do so."" At that time, the speaker became aware of a larger esquif that was approaching them quickly. The rower had of course turned his back, and did not expect anything before, was heading ""on his toes,"" as the term is — that is, by a marker behind the boat."
"He then lay down on a couch, and lay there for a moment lost in thought, when, behold, the table began to lie down. When the cloth was stretched out, all kinds of good words began to appear on it. ""Come what to come,"" he said to himself, ""I am hungry."" Then he fell and ate at his heart. When he had eaten all that he could swallow, he threw himself again on the couch and began to consider himself. Suddenly, three women entered, dressed entirely in black. One sat down at the piano, while the other two danced. Pulled as he was, when he saw this, he rose up and ran away with them. After this entertainment, they began to speak with him, speaking about one thing and another, and finally turned to the question of how he could break the fate that was binding them."
"The three brothers left the empty house, and went each one to seek his fortune in his own way. Ali Haitam bought a piece of muslin, folded it in a turban, sewn the lapis lazuli inside, and fixed it firmly on his head. Then he went to the bazaar and waited for an influx of wisdom, and saw! The power of the stone put to work and his spirit was full of knowledge! He knew the origin of all things, and his eyes could see through five-foot thick walls! He passed over the palace of the caliph, and he could see that in the corners of the cellars were hidden 9,000 sacks of gold, and that Fatma, the daughter of the caliph, was the most beautiful young girl in the East; and an idea came to him that dazzled him."
"A few days after the wedding, the Chevalier des Poissons told his wife that he wanted to look at the palace, so vast that he covered a league of land. They inspected the place together, and the task occupied them four days. On the fourth day, they went up to the roof, and the knight was amazed at the prospect. Never had he seen anything similar, nor could he ever have seen his equal, even if he had visited all Spain and the Empire of Morocco as well. ""What castle is it?"" asked the Chevalier des Poissons, ""that I see standing in the distance, so lonely and dark."" ""This,"" replied the princess, ""is the castle of Albastretch; he is delighted, and no one is able to undo the enchantment; and no one of all those who went there has ever been known to return."" The knight listened carefully to this, and as he was valiant and adventurous, the next morning he climbed his horse, took his spear and left for the castle."
"Yes, the boy was quite happy; and he thanked his brothers, and immediately went up to the hill, where the twelve mares had gone out to the grass. And when he went up there, he found them; and one of them had a big gray foal with him, which was so smooth that the sun shone with his coat. ""You are a handsome boy, my little foal,"" said the boy. ""Yes,"" said the foal, ""but you wait for another year to pass, and you see how great and elegant I will be."" Then the boy returned home, and when he returned the following year to look after his foal and his mares, ""the foal was so sweet and greasy that the sun shone with his coat, and he had grown so much that the boy had trouble riding it."" ""Well, it is quite clear that I am not losing anything by letting you feed for twelve months,"" said the boy at the year, ""but now you are big enough to come with me."""
"They were about to unload the elephant, who carried the dinner and the service, when it was discovered that Topaz and Ebony were no longer with the feast. They called them loudly: the forest echoed the names of Topaz and Ebony; the men sought them in all directions and filled the woods with their shouts, but they did not return to see anyone and heard no answer. ""We saw nothing,"" Rustem was told, ""but a vulture that fought with an eagle and ripped off all its feathers."" The story of this struggle aroused Rustem's curiosity; it went to the place on foot. He saw neither vulture nor eagle, but he found that his elephant, still loaded with luggage, had been attacked by a huge rhinoceros. One fought with his horn, the other with his trunk."
"Chang-ngan was the ancient capital of China, a very big city indeed, and Pin-Too, the master to whom Pei-Hang was sent was the wisest man. And there Pei-Hang quickly learned what the world thought, and many things besides. And as soon as he was eighteen years old, he took the red silk from his pigtail and the silver chain from his neck; for adults do not need charms to protect them from the Genii — they can usually protect themselves. When he was twenty, Pin-Too told him that he could no longer teach him. ""It is time for you to go back to your parents, and comfort them in their old age,"" he said."
"The king's daughter was now lamentable, tearing, blinding to the married man; she was always watching the loch. An old man came to her, and she told her how she had arrived to her spouse. Then he told her what it was necessary to do to save her spouse, and she did so. She took her harp on the shore, and sat down and played; and the Mademoiselle went up to listen, for the Mademoiselle loved the music that all the other creatures had. But when the woman saw the Mademoiselle she stopped. The Mademoiselle said, ""Go!"" but the princess said, ""No, no, until I saw my man again."" The Mademoiselle climbed up the head of the loch. The princess rejoined, and stopped until the Mademoiselle put him to the waist."
"Han Chung ran to look for his father's axe, and Ho-Seen-Ko, his little sister, went out of the house with him. ""Remember that it is the feast of the Lanterns tonight, father,"" she said. ""Do not fall asleep on the mountain; we want you to come back and light them for us."" She had a fish-shaped lantern, painted in red and black and yellow, and Han Chung had a great round, all bright scarlet, to carry in the procession; and, moreover, there were two large lanterns to hang at the door of the house as soon as it became dark. Wang Chih was not likely to forget the festival of the Lanterns, for the children had not spoken of anything else for a month, and he had promised to return home as soon as possible."
"When the two friends reconciled, they looked at the boy, and saw that he had a slight wound in his foot, and that they could not walk; and while they thought of what they should do, they spied on the grass called ""Doctor's Nakasé"", which was just sprouting; and they swore a little in their fingers and applied it to the part. Then they drew boiled rice from their lunch box and offered it to the little one, but she showed no sign of wanting to eat; and they caricatured him gently on the back, and caricaturated him; and as the pain of the wound seemed to have soothed, they admired the properties of the grass, when, opposite them, they saw the old foxes sitting next to a few piles of straw of rice."
"One day, the Emperor went to the hunt, and before he left, he said to his son-in-law, ""Stay in the castle while I am gone. I give you nine keys that you must keep carefully by you. I give you permission to open three or four coins. You will find in them silver and gold in abundance; neither is there any lack of weapons, nor any kind of treasure. You can even, if you feel inclined, open eight of the coins. But beware of unlocking the ninth one. Leave it alone; for, he said, if you do not do so, it will be the worst for you. The Emperor went away, leaving his son-in-law at home. The Emperor was barely gone when the Prince began to open one door after another, until he had examined eight rooms in succession. His eyes saw treasures of all kinds. When he finally came to the door of the ninth room, he said, ""I saw and did so many wonderful things, and he would be forbidden to enter me."""
"""My most solemn and wise bird,"" said Minerva to his Owl, ""I have admired you so far for your deep silence; but now I have the spirit to make you show your ability in the speech, for silence is admirable only in him who can, when he wishes, triumph over his eloquence and charm by a conversation full of grace. The Owl answered with solemn grimaces, and made silent signs. Minerva told him to put aside this affliction and to begin; but he only shook his wise head and remained silent."
"""Oh, I wish I could be rich and lie at ease on a soft couch with a red silk curtain!"" Just then a beautiful fairy floated from heaven, and said gently, ""Your will is granted to you."" So the poor stone tailor found himself rich and powerful and rested easily on his silk couch with his red curtain. As he looked, however, he saw the country king riding with many horsemen before and behind him, and with a great golden sun held on his head. He irritated the rich man to have no umbrella on his head and to see another more powerful than him, and in his discontent he cried, ""Was I a king like that?"" Once again his good fairy appeared, waved his rod, and said, ""It is as you desire."" Immediately the man was king, and before him and behind him I had mounted his men-to-arms, and on his head was a golden sun."
"Finally, the large folding doors were opened. In the summer announced that the dinner was served, and a long procession of old and young people was quickly formed, led by Mrs. November and her daughter Thanksgiving, whose birthday was, they placed themselves in the spacious dining room, where the long table moaning under her weight of good things was held, while four attendants continually ran in and out bringing more substantial and delights to the board and to the appetite. The winter suffocated under large trenches of meat and poultry, pies and puddings; the spring brought the oldest and freshest vegetables; the summer, creams and the richest ice creams; while the autumn served the guests with fruit, and poured the sparkling wine."
"""Take care of yourselves,"" said John, and they fled. ""First they went to the kitchen where Mammy Ria was preparing to cook Thanksgiving dinner; then they went out to the barn, where there were two new red calves, and five little puppies belonging to Juno, the dog, to see them. Then they went up to the fence of the barn and rushed to the pasture where grandfather kept her woolly sheep.""Baa-a!"" said the sheep when they saw the children; but then they always said that, no matter what happened. There were also cows in that pasture, and Mary Virginia was afraid of them, even though she knew that they were the mothers of the calves she had seen in the barn."
"When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two walked together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah at the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of wavy wheat, and the busy servants harvested it and gathered it together to bind themselves to the sheaves. First, the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shone with barley and wheat. Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the field and looked at the busy harvesters. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and every heap of wheat was piled up, a little grain fell unnoticed to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi, ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to him, ""Go, my daughter."""
"That afternoon he walked – or rather ran – to his mother, and, after consulting with him, joyfully accepted Mr. Crooker's offer. Interviews soon followed between his mother and his employer, which had given him something for which the boy had not dared to hope for. The old lonely and childless man, who had so many houses, wanted a home; and one of those houses he offered to Mrs. Hampton, with sufficient support for herself and her children, if she also wanted to make it a home for him. Of course, this proposal was accepted; and Bert soon had the satisfaction of seeing the great ambition of his youth accomplished. He had a job that promised to become a profitable business (as it has been the case in a few years, he and the old man proved so useful to each other); and, even more, he was once again united with his mother and sisters in a happy home where he had since had many Thanksgiving dinners."
"She was naturally a daughter of quick and tender sensibilities, joyful of her general mood, but with a pathos bewitching interferent among her most joyful words and actions. She was also pointed out that she had a faculty, even from childhood, to cast her own feelings as a spell upon her companions. As she had been in her days of innocence, so she appeared tonight. Her friends, in the surprise and disarray of her return, almost forgot that she had left them, or that she had lost all her pretensions to their affection. In the morning, perhaps, they could have looked at her with altered eyes, but by the fire Thanksgiving, they only felt that their own Prudence had returned to them, and were grateful."
"One day, a newspaper came from Uncle Obadiah, but only a letter in two years. Perhaps he knew how lucky they were to have to write more often. The boy had heard his mother say only the week before she wanted to write to Brother Obie, but he had no hand to write, especially when there was no good news to write. A thought now came to young Obadiah. He would write to his uncle tomorrow, and his brain began to humiliate enough with what he would say. When his time arrived, he invested a penny in a clean white stick of candy and the other two in a postage stamp. ""I will pay two hundred back to Dad as soon as I get the answer,"" said confidently to his conscience questioned."
"This last charge was one with which Aunt Kittredge was used to invading Clorinda when she was burning pies or wearing her best hood for the evening meeting. Minty's face grew so long that he looked like the reflection of a face in a spoon, and the tears came to her eyes. It must be a difficult world, since Jason found it. He was much more amazing than she; his round, swollen, frayed face was usually as happy as the sun. Jason had his troubles—Mentty knew what they were—but he was wearing them manly. He did not like Clorinda to use the eggs of his hens when he kept them for sale, and perhaps he was even more trying to be at school when the egg man came, and Aunt Kittredge was selling his eggs and putting the money in his pocket. Jason wanted to go into business for himself, and he had a high opinion on the poultry trade for a start."
"They were very busy. Katie, the eleven-year-old child, and Malcolm, ten years old, Guy, cut the lemon into long thin strips, stacked it on a large blue plate. Mary and James, eight-year-old twins, threw apples with a sorting machine. The long curling skins fell into a large pot of stone standing on a clean paper, spread on the floor. Charlie, who was only four years old, looked at none of the surrounding areas falling over the edge of the pot. Susan, seven years old, put dry grapes, some at a time, in a meat chopper screwed on the kitchen table. George, three years old, turned the handle of the chopper to grind the grapes. Baby Joe crawled on the kitchen floor after a kitten. Mrs. Burns took a large piece of meat from a steam kettle on the bottom of the stove."
"Ezra had written a letter to the people of the house, and in it he had complained that he had never spent a day as weary, lonely as that day of Thanksgiving had been. After finishing this letter, he had sat down for a long time in the open fire that cracked cylinders all over the fireplace and sent his red forks to dance the chimney to reach the winds that glazed and gambled across the meadows of Kansas this November raw night. He had rained hard all day, and was cold; and although the open fire made all honest efforts to be joyful, Ezra, as he sat in front of him in the wooden rock and looked down in the flamboyant embers, experienced a terrible feeling of loneliness and ill-being of the country. ""I am sick o' Kansas,"" said Ezra to himself."
"""I would like all the children on this side of the North Pole to have turkey, squash and crambry, and things,"" said Silence quietly. ""Silence always wanted beautiful things like this.""A ""some nuts,"" added Terry, putting his small white teeth in the meat of a fat walnut. ""It doesn't seem like Thanksgivingy 't that drowns. ""I know someone who would be grateful with just nuts,"" smiled grandfather. ""I think he prefers to have them for all the classes of his Thanksgiving dinner!"" ""Just nuts! No turkey, no puddin, no anything?"" The rigolos grandmothers all bobbed with their plates and pimples in astonishment!"
"Everything was now calm in the meeting room, except for the calm and constant voice of the preacher. Soon a little creature dressed all in soft brown flew on the floor of a certain bench. It was a brave little body indeed, but which mother would not venture a good deal for her hungry babies? Such a meal that it was certainly the occasion of a life. Looking carefully around, then concluding that everything was safe, she disappeared in a hole in a corner of the way under the seat. In a wink, she was back; this time, however, she was not alone. Four little beats after Mamma Mouse, and eight bright eyes spied on a dinner worth running for. No matter what they did; but when Johnnie woke up to the strains of the closing hymn and tried to remember what had happened wrong, he saw nothing of the cakes frown with pink saved some scattered crumbs."
"In any case, the breach had begun when Davis' cattle had broken the worn fence and demolished the Dun corn harvest, and it expanded when Dun's pigs found their way through an old water ditch and rooted a field of Davis sweet potatoes. Several similar depredations were repeated, then hunting rifles were used on both sides with a revealing effect. The culminating point was reached when John Dun left Rebecca, the only child of the Davises. The young couple was banned their respective homes, although the farm they were renting was barely half a mile away, and the weeks rolled in months with no sign of their loving parents. However, Walter was born, the two grandmothers stole, without the knowledge of their husbands, and mixed their tears in happy communion on the blue-eyed little moth."
"She ate her supper with a warm appetite, said her prayers with John, and rolled herself on the bed of feathers in the chariot, while John took more wood, and, on the shoulder of her carabiner, lay down the ropes that tied her oxen, and then went up on the guard of the camp. Hannah looked at her beautiful grave face, like the light that lit her, for a few minutes, and slept quietly until dawn. And the next day, at sunset, the little feast rose up at the door of the log cabin, which they called house. She looked very pretty at Hannah. She had the gift of a fairy, which is so rare among mortals, to see the beauty in her weakest expression; and the young grass around the door of the rough stone, the cones spit on the great larch behind her, the sunny sides of the west window, the laughter and spark of the stream that ran through the glade of the new ones."
"One day Robin walked alone in the woods, and reached a river covered with a very narrow bridge, on which only one man could pass. In the midst of him stood a stranger, and Robin turned him back and let him pass. ""I am not a man of yours,"" said Robin, and he drew his bow with anger and set him an arrow, ""You would shoot at a man who has only arms?"" asked the stranger in contempt; and with shame Robin threw his bow, and unlocked an oak stick beside him. ""We will fight until one of us falls into the water,"" he said; and they fought, until the stranger planted a blow so much that Robin rolled into the river. ""You are a courageous soul,"" he said, when he had retired to the ground, and he blew an explosion with his horn that brought fifty good companions, dressed in green, to the small bridge."
"Although the farmer of Mount Vernon was greatly removed from the business world, he was in no way unaware of the progress of public affairs. When the mail bag arrived, he chose his letters and put them aside to read in the isolation of his library. The newspapers he would break through by taking his only cup of tea (his only supper) and reading passages with a special voice of interest, pointing out the thing as he went. He read with sharpness and precision. These evenings with his family always ended at 9 a.m. precise, when he said good night to everyone and retired to rest, to rise at four o'clock and renew the same routine of work and enjoyment."
"Then the poor miller's daughter sat down, and she had no idea how to turn the straw into gold, and finally she began to cry. Suddenly the door opened, and walked a very little man who said, ""Good evening, Miss Miller-maid; why do you cry so bitterly?"" ""Oh!"" replied the girl, ""I must turn the straw into gold, and have no idea how this is done."" ""What will you give me if I turn it for you?"" asked the model. ""My necklace,"" answered the girl. ""The little man took the necklace, sat down at the wheel, and wept, weeping, and weeping, around him until the morning, when all the straw was thrown, and all the bobbins were full of gold. As soon as the sun arose, the king came, and when he saw the gold that he was amazed and delighted, but he wanted more precious metal."
"Now it came to pass that the child was still very little that her father was obliged to go to the capital of the kingdom. As it was so long a journey, neither his wife nor his child could go with him and he left alone, promising to bring them many nice gifts upon his return. The mother had never been far from the neighborhood and had not been able to get rid of a certain fear when she thought of the long journey that her husband had to make. At the same time, however, she could only feel the pride and satisfaction that it was her husband who was the first man in all this region to go to the rich city where the king and the nobles lived, and where there were so many beautiful and wonderful things to see. Finally, when the good wife knew that her husband would come back, she dressed her child gayly in the best clothes she had and she herself in the blue dress that she knew very much to love. It is not possible to describe the joy of the good wife when she saw her husband coming back safe and sound."
"In the forest stood a pretty little tree. He had a good place; he could have the sunlight, the air was abundant, and all around grew much bigger comrades — thorns as well as fir trees. But the little fir tree wanted to become taller. He did not care about the warm sun and fresh air; he did not get acquainted with the peasant children, who spoke together, when they had gone out to look for strawberries and raspberries. The children often came with an entire basket, or with a string of berries that they had put on a straw. Then they sat by the little fir tree and said, ""How beautiful and small!"" The fir tree did not like it at all. Next year, he had grown up, and the following year he was even taller. ""Oh, if I was only taller than the others!"" sighed the little fir."
"The people of the North believed that their gods lived above the earth in a wonderful city called Asgard. From this city they crossed the earth on a bridge that the people on earth had known as the rainbow. It seems strange that anyone could have lived with the gods in their beautiful city of Asgard and had shared in their joys and good works would have preferred to associate with the ugly and wicked giants. But this was the case of Loki-Red Loki, as it was called, because of his red hair. He was beautiful as a god; he was wise and intelligent as a god — smarter than any of the other gods. However, in a certain way, he differed from others; he had a bad heart, and liked to use his intelligence much better to attract gods and men into trouble than to make them happy."
"In the big square, the boldest of the boys often attached their toboggan to the carts of the inhabitants of the countryside, and they climbed with them in a good way. They went to the capital. When they were in the middle of their game, they came a big toboggan. He was painted rather white, and he sat in a hard and white fur, with a white and rough hat on his head. The toboggan rode twice around the square, and Kay tied his little toboggan, and he went with it. He went faster and faster, straight into the next street. The man who was driving turned and bowed familiarly towards Kay; it was as if they knew each other. Every time Kay wanted to throw his little toboggan, the stranger yelled again, then Kay stayed where he was, and they went to the gate of the city."
"Just such a farm stood in the countryside, and in this house lived an old couple, a peasant and his wife. Small as their property, there was an article among them that they could do without, a horse, who lived on the grass that he found on the edge of the highway. The old peasant went up into the city on that horse; and often his neighbors borrowed it, and gave the old couple some service in exchange for his loan. But they thought it would be better for them to sell the horse, or exchange it for something that could be more useful to them. But what could it be? ""You will know better, old man,"" said the woman. ""It is a day just today, so go up to town, and get rid of the horse for money, or make a good exchange; what you will do will be just for me."
"On the third day Esther clothed her royal garments, and stood in the inner court of the king's house; and the king sat on her royal throne in the royal house, on the door of the house. And the king saw Esther, the queen who stood in the courtyard, and she obtained thanks for her eyes; and the king held with Esther the golden scepter that was in her hand. Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. Then the king said to her, ""What do you want, Queen Esther? and what is your request? It will be given to you at the half of my kingdom."" And Esther answered, ""If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I have prepared for him today."" And the king said, ""Because Haman hasten to do what Esther has said. And the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
"One day, as they played, laughed and sang, harassing one another to make the most beautiful garlands, they were surprised by a strange sound of roaring. Closer he came, stronger he grew; and suddenly with the eyes frightened of the young girls he appeared a great chariot, drawn by four black canes, of wild appearance, full of moss. Not long the girls looked at the horses or the chariot — all the eyes were drawn by fascination to the driver of the car. He was beautiful as only god could be, and yet so dark that everyone knew immediately that he could not be other than Pluto, king of hell. Suddenly, while his horses were almost at full speed, he shook them at the stop. Then he rushed to the ground, seized Proserpina in his arms, mounted his chariot, and fled before the frightened nymphs caught their breath to scream."
"The house was dark and cold; but the poor man told his wife to wait and see what would happen. He placed the little mill by hand on the table, and he started to turn the crank. First, he came out a few large candles of burning wax, and a fire on the fireplace, and a pot of boiling porridge on it, because in his mind he said they had to come first. Then he laid down a tablecloth, dishes, spoons, knives and forks, and towels. He himself was astonished at his luck, as you may believe; and his wife was almost beside her with joy and astonishment. Well, they had a capital supper; and after he was eaten, they landed out of the mill all possible to make their house and themselves warm and comfortable."
"The presidential election in the autumn of 1848 aroused much interest, as Wisconsin had become a state, and citizens could vote for national candidates. I was in Jonathan Piper's store one night, with my father, when a dozen men were present. A political discussion got up and got hot, and finally a division was called. Two or three voted for Zachary Taylor, the Whig candidate; one for Lewis Cass, the Democrat; and the rest for Martin Van Buren, the Free Solleur. The state went with the only voter, because Cass carried it by a small plurality. Good health was the rule among the workers and simple pioneers, but plowing the ground freed the poison that nature seemed to have put on the guard, and each at some point went down with the ""shakes."" However, the powerful influence of the sun, quinine, and cholagogue quickly gained their way, and in a few years malaria became a simple memory."
"All that night, the valiant captain and his men kept a watchful and watchful watch, for the Spaniards were almost at the end of the fire. However, the day had not come earlier than the buccaneers weighed anchor and sailed again for the Spanish ships. The Spaniard, seeing that they were coming, were embarking and moving to face the attack. The firefighter in his place at the head of the line soon met the largest ship, and fought straight with him. Too late, the Spaniards discovered their terrible danger, and although they were trying to free themselves, they were not able to do so. The flames of the burning ship caught the wood and rigging of the ship, and, in a very short period of time, consumed the stern of the ship, leaving the front part to sink into the sea, carrying with him the survivors."
"It had been decided that Walter should follow the profession of his father, that of the law, and therefore he entered his father's office, to serve a five-year apprenticeship. Although he might seem surprising, given his former indolence, it is true that he gave himself to his work with a great industry. At the same time, he continued to read stories of adventure and history and other similar works with as much zest as ever, and concluded an agreement with a friend where each had to entertain the other with original romances. The monotony of office functions was also noted by many trips in the country, in which the greatest pleasure was felt in the natural beauties and in the historical associations of old ruins and battlefields and other similar places."
"When the boys came home, they told their plan to Willie's sister, Matie, and then the three decided to execute it. ""Rap-a-tap, tap,"" sounded quickly at the library door after supper. ""Enter,"" was the answer, and in limited the three children, their faces illuminated with smiles to the prospect of spending an evening with Uncle Jack. ""Welcome, young people,"" he said, in a joyful tone. ""But you look as if you were expecting something; what is it?"" ""Oh, Uncle Jack, we want you to tell us everything about pottery,"" cried the boys. ""Yes, please do it,"" he sang to Matie. ""All about pottery? Why, my dear children, it's very much like asking me to talk about the whole world, because a full story of one would almost be a story of the other; and I could barely do that, you know, with a smile, you know."
"The main business of the people of this country was the elevation of the sweet marjoram. The soil and climate were admirably adapted to the cultivation of grass, and the fields and fields of it had to be seen in all directions. At that time, and a good time ago, very few sweet marjoram was raised in other parts of the world, so this country had trade almost everything to it. The great feast of the year was the day when the harvest of this national herb began. It was called ""Day of sweet marjoram,"" and the people, young and old, thought of it more than any other feast of the year. On this happy day, everyone went out into the fields. There had never been a person so old, or so young, or so busy, that they could not go to help with the harvest."
"Among many interesting memories and reflections, this worthy and charming old gentleman said that he thought that today's young people were less polite than in the old time, less defensive, less decorative. That's perhaps true, and I tried to be sufficiently delayed to my courteous host, so as not to disagree with him. But when I look at the young people of my own knowledge, I remember that Jamie took the luggage by hand as naturally as if he had not been born for nothing else; Frank never failed to open a door; Arthur pulled out Maggie's chair at the table before he took his; Nelly and Ruth came to my sweet and brilliant party as if they did not know that the young gentlemen they were waiting to meet were prevented from attending; while Lucy fled breath for you, and Mary sat down and listened with flattering intent, and Anne and Alice and—looking over my constituency, I find the young people charming."
"For a week, Jack wondered and had fun in himself how he could get something for Christmas gifts for his little sisters. He could not do anything at home without seeing them, or at school without the teacher seeing him, or the big boys plaguing him about it. Besides, he preferred to buy something pretty, as they had never seen before - Chinese dolls in pink dresses, or something like that. One morning, however, Jack discovered some quail tracks in the snow near the straw-stack, and he no longer wondered about the means, but at one point was awakened to the importance of this discovery."
"Maggie soon thought that she had been in the attic for hours, and it had to be tea time, and they all had their tea, and didn't think of her. Well, then, she would stay up there and starve herself, hide behind the bathtub, and stay there all night – and then they would all be scared, and Tom would be sorry. So Maggie thought in the pride of her heart, as she was clapping behind the bathtub; but now she began to cry again at the idea that they were not bothering to be there. If she would come down again to Tom now – would he forgive her? Maybe her father would be there, and he would take his share. But then she wanted Tom to forgive her because he loved her, not because her father told her. No, she would never come down if Tom didn't come to get her."
"It is said that dives have been caught in the lakes of New York at eighty feet below the surface, with hooks for trout — even though Walden is deeper than that. What a surprise do the fish have to be to see this intransigent visitor of another sphere accelerate in their schools! Yet, he seemed to know his course as surely under the water as on the surface, and to swim much faster there. Once or two I saw a wave where he was approaching the surface, just putting his head out to reconnoitre, and immediately plunge again. I found that it was as good for me to rest on my row and wait for him to reappear to try to calculate where he was rising; for again and again, when I was extending my eyes on the surface in a way, I would suddenly be surprised by his inert laugh behind me."
"After a winter night, I woke up with the impression that a question had been asked to me, that I had tried in vain to answer in my sleep, like what, when, where? But there was the nascent Nature, in which all the creatures live, looking at my wide windows with a serene and satisfied face, and no question on his lips. I woke up to a question answered, to Nature and to the light of day. The snow lying at the bottom of the earth dotted with young pines, and the very slope of the hill on which my house is placed, seemed to say, Before! Nature poses no question and answers no question that we asked. It has long taken its resolution. ""O Prince, our eyes contemplate with admiration and transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of this universe. The night veil is undoubtedly part of this glorious creation; but the day comes to reveal to us this great work, which extends from the earth even in the plains of ether."""
"When the ground was not yet completely covered, and still near the end of the winter, when the snow was melted on my south hill and around my pilewood, the partridges came out of the wood morning and evening to feed on it. Whatever side you walk in the woods, the partridge bursts on swirling wings, shoving snow from dry leaves and branches on the top, which comes to sinuate in the rays of the sun like gold dust; for this courageous bird must not be afraid of winter. It is frequently covered by drifts, and it is said, ""sometimes plunges from the wing into the soft snow, where it remains hidden for a day or two."" I also started them in the open ground, where they had come out of the wood at sunset to ""boil"" the wild apple trees. They will regularly come every evening to particular trees, where the cunning athlete is waiting for them, and the remote orchards thus suffer not a little."
"In addition to the small ants, I found another ant that lives on these acacias, whose habits seem to be quite different. It makes the entrance holes to the thorns near the center of one of the two pairs, and not near the end, and it is not as active as the other species. It is also quite rare; but when it occurs, it occupies the whole tree, excluding the other. The glands on the acacia are also frequented by a small species of wasp. I sowed the seeds of the acacia in my garden, and raised some young plants. The ants of several kinds were numerous; but none of them were taken away, nor the glands and fruit bodies for food; for, as I have already mentioned, the species that frequent the thorns are not found in the forest."
"Although the young Whittier was a very awake and eager boy to learn, there was only the district school, held for a few weeks each winter, for him to attend. Yet, there was no lack of opportunity to highlight his poetic gift. One of his school teachers, who lived part of the term in Whittier's house, read to the family from various interesting books, and one night chose a volume of Burns poems for their entertainment. As the lines of the beloved Scottish poet fell from the reader's lips, the young boy listened as he had never listened in his life. His own power awakened and responded warmly to that of the older poet. From that time, whether he was at home or at school, he found great pleasure in writing verses, which he often showed to his young friends."
"Although he was reflected beyond his years and showed unusual poetic power, the young Bryant was in other rather ordinary ways boy. He was calm and studious in the school room, but he was quite active in the games played outside. Sports that he and the other boys of the district school, he wrote: ""We were having fun building dams across the river, and throwing rafts made of old boards on the collected water; and in winter, with sliding on the ice and building snowbarricades, which we called for forts, and dividing the boys into two armies, and using snowballs for ammunition, we demanded the possession of these fortresses."
"After graduating from Harvard, Holmes entered the Dane Law School in Cambridge. He did not feel at all sure, however, that he wanted to be a lawyer, and at the end of a year he had lost so much interest in his studies that he abandoned them. As the doctor's call seemed much more to his liking, he took two courses of study in a private medical school. This preparation was not, of course, sufficient to allow him to practice more, so a trip to Europe where he could study under the great professors of the School of Medicine of Paris became necessary. As a result, his parents, at some sacrifice for themselves, provided him with the necessary means, and he sailed from New York in the spring of 1833. During the two years spent abroad, Holmes gave himself all the time to his chosen study. ""I am more and more attached to the study of my profession every day... I am busy from morning to evening, and as everyone is happy when he is busy, I am having as much fun as I could,"" he wrote."
"When we are still little children, long before the moment when these two adult ladies offer us the choice of Hercules, there happens to us a young angel, holding in his cubes of the right hand as dice, and in his left spheres as marbles. The cubes are of stainless ivory, and on each one is written in letters of gold — Truth. The spheres are venous and scratched and spotted below, with a dark red above where the light falls on them and in a certain aspect you can make on each of them the three letters, L, I, E. The child to whom they are most likely offered clutches to both. The spheres are the most convenient things in the world; they roll with the least impulse possible right where the child would have them. The cubes will not roll at all; they have a great talent to remain motionless, and always keep the right side."
"Lowell was a man of great knowledge, and has an important place in American literature for his exceptional critical ability and his delicious spirit, and for the artistic excellence of his prose and poetry; but the secret of his power lies not so much in these things as in the sincerity and vigour of thought that rise above any bookishness, and in the warm human feeling that has manifested itself for the love of his fellowmen rather than for fame and distinction. Probably what attracts him most to his compatriots is the quality that he attributes to others in these words of admiration: ""I am sure that the President (Hayes) and his wife have in them this excellent thing that we call Americanism, which, I suppose, is this ""dignity of human nature"" that the philosophers of the last century sought and never found, and which, after all, may consist of not thinking better or worse than your neighbors because of any artificial distinction."
"Although Miss Mitford was 19 years older than Miss Barrett, the friendship between them was the closest and lasted until the death of Miss Mitford in 1855. Their correspondence was constant and voluminous, as was the case with Miss Barrett with all her close friends. These letters from her sick room are no more remarkable for number than for brightness and vivacity. There is little talk of her ills, except when her friends specifically demanded news of her health, and the letters deal with literature rather than other subjects. This was, of course, the most natural; invalids could have little news to communicate from her couch to her friends in the outside world. Her literary activity, too difficult, if not impossible, and she began to contribute to poems from magazines of various kinds, which attracted a lot of attention."
"It was my misfortune to have a canoe that was very heavy and therefore lazy. That's why we were left a little behind the rest, there were only four men next to me in the boat. When the tide fell, it left several benches of bare sand, and therefore we, not knowing the location of the canal among such a variety of streams, we led for more than two miles into a bench where we were forced to lie until the high waters came. As soon as the tide began to turn, we rowed, but despite all our efforts, we could not find or exceed our companions. At ten o'clock, when the tide fell, we stuck a row in the sands and slept in turn in our canoe, where we were pierced by the showers that fell into the night."
"After his return from the Creek War, he was elected to Congress in 1826 and 1828. He was defeated in 1830 and re-elected in 1832. When he was elected for the first time, he knew very little about the government and completely ignored his duties as a member of Congress, but again his common sense and brilliant spirit came to his aid; and although he worked under great disadvantages, he gained the respect and admiration of other legislators. He was always a curious and remarkable figure in Washington, because of his robe, which was similar to that of his wooden companions, and because of his way, which was as strange as his clothes."
"There was a certain divergence of opinion as to the time of departure. The day, it was suggested, would be better, as it would allow them to see the nature and extent of their danger, and to oppose it. Darkness would be much more likely to embarrass their own movements than those of the enemy, who were familiar with the ground. A thousand obstacles would occur in the night, which could prevent them from acting together, or even obeying, or even checking, the commander's orders. But, on the other hand, it was urged that the night should have many obvious advantages in the treatment of an enemy who rarely carried his hostilities beyond the day. The Spanish's late active operations had thrown the Mexicans out of their custody, and it was unlikely that they would anticipate such a rapid departure from their enemies."
"All the Greeks knew that they were embarking on a dangerous business, but for the Spartans it meant more than that. Leonidas himself felt that he was going to die, because the oracle of Delphi had predicted that Sparta would be saved if one of his kings were to perish, and Leonidas was more than willing to make this sacrifice for his condition. His three hundred disciples, trained from childhood to look at death as infinitely preferable to defeat, had, with this courage that made their name an epithet indicating the highest kind of bravery, celebrated their funeral games before leaving. When they arrived at the passage of Thermopylae, they found a new cause of fear. This is the path that led to the mountains, and which made possible a descent from the enemy to the rear of those stationed in the pass. However, Leonidas was assured that this mountain track was almost unknown, and that the entrance to it was very difficult to find; so, when he had sent a band of Phocians to keep it hardly for himself."
"They went to the king's palace, and when they came, Aylmer entrusted them to his steward, Ahelbrus, whom he charged to raise them up in knight's ways. They were added to the house of Aylmer, and they taught everything that the squire of kings had to know. But the horn had to come to things greater than that. He quickly learned, and became loved by everyone; and above all, Rimenhild, the king's daughter, loved him from the day when she looked at him for the first time. His love for him became stronger and stronger every day, although she dared not speak to him, for she was a princess, and he was only a squire saved by chance from the sea."
"The horn, watered with fury, went to the stable, and saddled on his foot, and took his arms; so fierce was his son that no one dared to resist him. When everything was ready for his departure, he sought Rimenhild. ""Your dream was true, dear love,"" he said. ""The fish has torn your net, and I am going from you. But I will put a new end to the dream; do not be afraid. Now go well; the king your father has driven me out of his kingdom, and I must seek adventure in other countries. Seven years I will wander, and I may gain the fortune that will bring me back to pursue you honorably. But if at the end of seven years I did not return to Westerness, and I did not send you news, then you will take another man for a husband in my place, and I will put myself out of your heart. Now, for the last time, hold me in your arms and kiss me goodbye."""
"When Rimenhild saw the ring, she knew it right away. She took an excuse, and left the feast, and went to her bow. In a short time, she secretly sent for the palm grove, and asked him where he had obtained the ring. ""Queen,"" said Horn, in my travels, ""I met a named Horn. He gave me this ring to bring you; it was on board the ship that I met him, and he was dying."" He said this to prove that his love was always constant for him. But Rimenhild believed him, and when she heard him say that Horn was dead, he became like a madness of grief. Horn, seeing how strong his love was, threw his palm coat, and showed him the false stain on his face, and told him that he was in truth Horn, his lover."
"Thus the horn returned to his kingdom, but he had not yet punished Fikenhild the traitor, who had separated him first from Rimenhild (this had told him), and King Modi, who had sought to marry her against his will. Fikenhild, when Horn returned to Westerness in time to save Rimenhild from Modi, had fled; but he had always plotted a deep betrayal in his heart. Through bribes and favours, he won many knights to follow him; and he built himself a great stone castle, put on a rock, surrounded by all sides of water, so that no one could easily come there."
"Their journey prospered, and they disembarked safely in Denmark, in the dominions of an Ubbe, a rich count, who had been a friend of King Birkabeyn, Havelok's father. When Havelok heard who was the lord of this part of Denmark, he was happy, and went to Ubbe Castle in good hope. He did not yet dare say that he was Birkabeyn's son, for if Earl Godard heard of this, he would come against him and kill him before he could win any disciples. But he went to Ubbe and spoke to him in a fair and courteous manner, and gave him a golden ring, and asked permission to settle in that country to be a merchant; and Ubbe, seeing how strong and comical Havelok was, willingly gave him permission, and then told him at a great feast. Havelok went to the feast, and Goldborough with him, and the sons of Grim; and Ubbe, seeing how much strong and well-loved he was, he grew up to love him so well."
"Next to the great palace of the Marquis was a small village, where a number of poor people lived. Among them lived a man called Janicola, the poorest of them. Janicola had a daughter named Griselda, the most beautiful girl under the sun. She had been raised simply, knowing more work than ease, and had worked hard to keep her father's old age in comfort. All day long, she sat down and looked at sheep in the fields; when she returned to their poor house in the evening, she brought with her some herbs, which she would cut and cook, to make a meal before she rested on her hard bed; and she had no idle moment until she slept. Walter had often seen this young girl as he went out hunting, and he was filled with pleasure in view of her beauty and her sweet and kind life."
"They met on an island in the Rhone, and the warriors of the two sides led on either side, the spectators of the battle. At the first moment of the encounter, the two spears trembled, but the two riders kept their seats unshakeable. They disassembled, and drew their swords. Then followed a battle that seemed so equal, that the spectators could not make an opinion on the likely result. Two hours and more the knights continued to strike and scatter, to push and keep, without showing any sign of weariness, or to be taken without the knowledge. Finally Roland furiously struck on Oliver's shield, burying Durindana in his edge so deeply that he could not bring him back, and Oliver, almost at the same time, pushed so vigorously on Roland's breastplate that his sword fled to the handle."
"Then the king said to Ganelon, ""Who can I make head of the rear guard that I leave behind?"" Ganelon answered, ""Roland, for there is no one like him in all the army?"" And Charles made Roland the head of the rear guard. Roland remained behind him, Oliver, his dear comrade, and the twelve peers, and Turpin the archbishop, who, out of love for Roland, went with him, and twenty thousand tried warriors. And the king said to his nephew, ""Good Roland, behold, I have given you half of my army; you keep them in safety."" Roland answered, ""Do not be afraid, I will account for them."" And they left one another, and the king and his army went forward until they reached the borders of Spain. And, as the king thought of his nephew who had left behind him, his heart had become more and more heavy in advance."
"A little in the woods there was a fair castle, with a double moat, and surrounded by robust walls. Here lived this noble knight, Sir Richard Lee, to whom Robin Hood had lent the four hundred pounds to buy his land. He saw the little company of outlaw fighting their way, and he hastened to call them to come and shelter in his castle. ""Welcome, Robin Hood! Welcome!"" he exclaimed, as he led them. ""I thank you for your comfort, courtesy and great kindness to me in the forest. There is no man in the world that I love as much as you. For all the proud sheriff of Nottingham, here you will be safe!"
"The king lived for many months in Nottingham, but no one came to claim the knight's land, and he could never hear of Robin Hood in what part of the country he could be. But Robin always went freely here and there, wandering wherever he chose on the hill and the valley, killing the king's deer, and disposing of himself at his will. Then a forester's head, which was in close presence on the king, addressed himself, and said, ""If you want to see the good Robin, you must do as I say. Take five of the best knights who are on your train, and get down to the abbey there, and get the habits of the monks. I will be your guide to show you the way, and before you return to Nottingham, I dare bet my head that you will meet Robin if he is still alive. Before you come to Nottingham, you will see him with your own eyes."
"When they came to Nottingham, all the people came to see them; they saw nothing but green coats covering all the fields; then each one began to say to another: ""I fear that our king will be killed; if Robin of the woods comes to the city, he will never let one of us live. They all hastened to escape, men and children, Yemen, and peasants; the plowman left the plow in the field, the blacksmith left his shop, and the old women who could not walk, who were mistreated on their litters. The king laughed loudly and long to see the cities weaken in this way, and ordered them to return. He soon let them understand that he had been in the forest, and that from that day he had forgiven Robin of the woods."
"One day Arthur-a-Bland went out into the Sherwood forest to see the deer, and there he met Robin Hood. As soon as Robin saw him, he thought he would do sports, and he therefore called him to stand up.""Why, who are you, my friend, who are you here so bold?"" he said. ""To be brief, you look like a thief who comes to steal the king's game. I am a guard in the forest; the king entrusts me to look after the deer. Therefore I must stand up."""
"For a while, Kitty looked at the scenes that passed quickly, but near the little head, the eyelids closed, and Maggie took the sleeping child on her knees, and let her sleep there until they reached the Cairo station and rushed into the diner and confusion of the motley crowd. With a stunned look, Kitty leaned back into the car that was carrying them to the new hotel, opposite the Esbekiyah gardens; then, as she approached the entrance, she looked at the large building with its many balconies and columns, and exclaimed: ""It just looks like a great church organ, Mamma."" Many exciting days followed before they left for their journey to the Nile. The bright sun of this cloudless sky seemed to delight the disabled."
"I take the drawing. There is a beautiful lady to teach her. She wears a white bag with red pockets, and a blue bow. She pulls her hair on her head. She says we have to draw things, when we look at them. I drew a dog, but he came out a lamb. I can make a very nice bird. Jim puts the feathers on her tail. Mr. Wiseman has snakes in a few bottles, a frog and a toad. He has locusts with a pin stuck through them, a spider and potato bugs. It's the museum. He thinks a lot of them. There is football, and we play it. He's as big as a pumpkin, but you cut him. Then you're hit and hit and your leg hurt; but you don't cry. You never cry except when Jim sleeps in the night, and your throat sores are pretty bad. There's twenty-four more days on the peace of the paper. Give my love to Tooty. How is the baby? How is the baby? How is the baby?"
"The American horses, in time, met the wild horses, then the men noticed that they were very different animals. The wild horse is smaller and more muscular, it has stronger and stronger limbs, a bigger head, and a more bushy mane and tail. Its ears are longer and more inclined to lie on its head, its feet are smaller and sharper in front, and its hair is rougher and thicker. Its color is often curiously mixed in black and white dots and flecks, like some circus horses you may have seen; and, if its color is uniform, it is usually dark red or dark grey or mouse color. These mustangs are quite wild, and have no fixed food."
"When Catherine, this cold morning, inspected the awful emptiness of the cabinet, she put her cold blue hands into despair; but, putting her poor little hands to a hard test, she could not draw good bread and meat from it; something had to be done immediately, if she wanted to save the children from hunger. She finally leaned down that many rich of Kaboutermankensburg liked to burn cones of pine instead of rough logs, not only because of the lively, hot and crepitating fire they produced, but also because of the soft resinous smell they threw, filling the house with a perfume like the one that came up from the censors of the cathedral. It was bad for Catherine to go hunting pine cones. The snow laid a good foot over the bright brown treasures, and she herself was only thinly clothed; but the children had to have bread."
"It was a beautiful summer evening, towards the end of July, that the party of friends was all together on the lawn; they had drawn the garden chairs, and, after the croquet game in which Madeleine and Howard had managed to beat Ethel and Martin, were ready to devote the rest of the evening to talking. Seeing this, Mr. Morton had tidyed his book, and had set his chair next to them, while Mrs. Morton, regardless of the fall of the roosts and the rising humidity, had followed the example of her husband. ""Now,"" says Mr. Morton, ""short holidays, like this Saturday afternoon, are good; but are not better holidays? And now that everyone is thinking about making a trip somewhere or something else, should we not ""do like Rome"" and think about the same thing?"" ""I suppose, sir, that we all thought about it, more or less, during the past year,"" says Martin; ""and I have to think about it seriously, because my holidays are set by official rules, and start very soon."""
"Our guest had not arrived, but there was another train an hour later. Did the family have to wait for my friend, or should I wait alone, who was the person specially to visit? My father acted nervously on the floor, as he was when he felt disturbed. He had the evening papers to read, and he never opened them before tea. It was a habit of him. He was very fixed — or, as some say, ""sit"" — in his little ways. It was Bridget's evening, and she had begun to show a darkened face. Bridget was not a friend of ""the company"", and it was a policy to reconcile it."
"Now, at that time, there was always a war somewhere or another, and the French armies were fighting in all parts of Europe; and the king cared very little about who his officers were, or where they came from, if they were only brave men and intelligent fighters, and ready to go where he liked to send them. So, as you may think, it wasn't long before our friend Maurice, who was just as brave as one of them, and a good business smarter than most, began to do. First, he was a lieutenant, then a captain, then a major, then a colonel, and finally, while he was still a fairly young man, he went out as Count of Saxony, and Field-Marshal of the army of Flanders, with fifty thousand men under him! It was a pretty good promotion, wasn't it?"
"So Mandy on the step of the door, and Bub on the floor, with his back against the door, which he gently slanted as he mung his cake, were very quiet and comfortable for a minute or two. The hens were stunned and splashed, with cossy noises, in the sun before the door; the baby blinked and drunk contentedly. ""Pretty for another bite?"" said Bub, holding Mandy's cake near his left ear. ""In a minute,"" said Mandy, with his mouth full. ""Bub Lewis, you are ashamed of yourself? Well, you have eaten of my piece! I saw you right now! ""Aint, be it! You can see great things with the back of your head! Here is your piece 'not' mine."
"Elizabeth Eliza wanted to have a system in the move, and spent the evening drawing up a plan. It would be easy to arrange everything in advance, so there shouldn't be the confusion her mother feared, and the discomfort they had in their last move. Ms. Peterkin shook her head, she didn't think it was possible to move with any comfort. Agamemnon said a lot of things could be done with a list and a program. Elizabeth Eliza said that if all were well arranged a program would be perfectly easy. They had to have new carpets, which could be laid in the new house the first thing. Then, the furniture could be moved, and there would be two comfortable rooms, in which Mr. and Mrs. Peterkin could sit, while the rest of the move was going."
"When Soupramany understood what he had taken, he pronounced one of those long and low notes of satisfaction by which an elephant expressed joy; and he patiently waited, waiting for Jim to withdraw his prize from the hook and put another bait for him. But Jim, the little rascal, sometimes liked to hit Old Soup. He signaled to us, as much as to say, ""Look, and you will see fun, now!"" Then he took the fish, which he threw in a water garden placed there for the purpose, and returned to his place without putting any bait on Old Soup's hook. The intelligent animal did not try to throw his line into the water. He tried to move Jim down, begging for screams. He was curious to see what tender tones he seemed to try to give his voice. Seeing that Jim paid no attention to his calls, but sat down and laughed that he was processing his own line, Old Soup went to him, and with his chest tried to turn his head."
"Now, a last wash in the acid, then in the water, and these very hardened metal tips are allowed in the coin, there to receive the stamp that bears witness to their value. In the coin, the planks are first given to the milling machine. They are placed flat between two rings of steel, and when the rings move one approach to the other, and the planks are tight and congested on each side, and not finding an escapement they turn towards the edges and exit at the end of the sad little journey with a rim raised around the edges. Beyond the milling machines are held the ten presses-pieces. These presses are frequented by women. Look at this one near us. To his right hand is a box containing silver planks, which must be invented in fifty cent coins. On this round ""die"", which you see in the center of the machine, are engraved the letters and figures that must appear on the back of the half-dollar. To his right hand is a box containing silver planks, which must be invented in pieces of fifty cents. On this round ""die"", which you see in the center of the machine, are engraved the letters and figures that must appear on the face on the face of the big one side of the other. Tote, which works directly, on the same, on the other, on the other, on the face, on the top of the same, on the bottom of the same."
"It seemed to Sam that the whole country around, as far as we could see, was transformed into a great field, into a state of perfect cultivation. But the growing ""culture"" was not that of cotton, corn, cow peas, sorghum, or anything else that he had ever seen in such a place. As he came out of the ground, there were long rows of very singular bushes, whose stems were candy sticks, and the leaves were blackberry pies, and on the whole the field fell a rain of molasses. Sam, however, was the most astonished of the curious fruits that the bushes wore. The twigs of some of them supported the petticoats and trumpets of tin; others leaned under a wealth of fire and Roman candles; others, again, were weighted with his favorite sardines; and so on in an infinite variety."
"The May festivals were not limited to the British Isles. They were found, with variations adapted to different ethnic groups, throughout Europe. In France, the day was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the girls celebrated her by dressing the prettiest in white, crowning her and decorating her with flowers, and beating her under a window of flowers and greens, built next to the road. There, she was seated in condition, while her attendants begged the passers-by, for the ""Lady of the May"", silver, which was used in a party later that day. In Toulouse, there was an old custom of giving a price of gold violet for the best poem. This custom held her place for more than four centuries. The masts of May also prospered in France, and had golden pendants. The Dutch Maypole was still different, being surrounded by trees stuck in pots of flowers, decorated with colored flags, and cerceaux of garlands and golden balls."
"""When you want it to be well done, do it yourself,"" is an old saying, and a very good saying; but it is not always possible or desirable to apply this advice. Therefore it is sometimes preferable to adopt an amendment to this proverb, and to read it as follows: ""When you want it to be well done, do it yourself, or see it done."" Thus thought Louis IX. of France, sometimes called Saint Louis, because he was considered rather better than most people. Among his good qualities, he was kind to the lower classes of his nation. He went, very clearly dressed, and assisted by two or three courtiers, and visited the people in their homes. He was interested in their personal affairs, and when they were very needy, he commanded them bread and other food."
"There was a young man who spent all his time traveling. One day, while he was walking, he picked up a snuff box. He opened it, and the snuff box said to him in Spanish, ""What do you want?"" He was very scared, but fortunately, instead of throwing the box, he closed it and put it in his pocket. Then he went away, far away, and as he was leaving, he said, ""If it still says to me, ""What do you want?"" I will know better what to say this time."" Then he took out the box to snuff and opened it, and asked him again, ""What do you want?"" My golden hat, answered the youth, and immediately it was full. Our young man was delighted. He was never to need anything again."
"There was once a hunter. He went every day in search of the game, but he often did not kill anything, and he was obliged to go home with his empty bag. On this account he was nicknamed ""Huntsman the Inchanceux."" Finally, he was reduced by his bad fortune to such ends that he did not have a piece of bread or a left kopek. The miserable man wandered into the forest, cold and hungry; he had not eaten anything for three days, and was almost starving. He lay on the grass decided to put an end to his existence; fortunately better thoughts came to his mind; he crossed and threw the weapon. Suddenly, he heard a noise of rustling near him. He seemed to emit thick grass near him. The hunter rose up and approached the place."
"The poor old man felt sorry for the fish if he had to be under his rule, because prosperity had spoiled him well. However, he did not dare disobey, and once again called his powerful friend. ""Make your wife the Queen of the waters?"" cried the Golden Fish. ""This is the last thing I should do. She is unfit to rule, for she cannot govern herself or her desires. I will once again make her a poor old woman. Goodbye! You will not see me again."" The old man returned with this unpleasant message, to find the palace transformed into a humble hut, and his wife in a skirt of wooden sons in place of the rich brocade she had worn late. She was sad and humble, and much easier to live with than she had been."
"A certain man had a shepherd who had served him faithfully and honestly for many years. One day, as the Shepherd took care of his sheep, he heard a sound whistling in the forest, and wondered what he could. So he went into the wood in the direction of the noise, to learn what he was. There he saw that the dry grass and the leaves had caught fire, and in the midst of a burning circle a serpent was whining. The Shepherd stopped to see what the serpent would do, for the fire was burning all around, and the flames were coming closer and closer every moment. Then the serpent cried out from the middle of the fire. ""Oh, Shepherd! for heaven's sake, save me from this fire!"" The Shepherd spread his croque on the flames to the serpent, and the serpent passed it on his hand, and with his hand he crawled to his neck, where he was twisting himself."
"There was an emperor who was called Trojan. This emperor had goat's ears, and he called the barber after the hairdresser to shave him. But he who had never come out; for while the barber shaved him, the emperor asked what he saw little in him, and when the barber answered him that he was watching his goat's ears, the emperor immediately wanted him. Finally, he came in turn to a certain barber to break the disease, and sent his apprentice to the place. When the apprentice appeared before the emperor, he was asked why his master did not come, and he answered, ""Because he is sick."" The emperor sat down, and allowed the young man to shave him. The apprentice shaved him, seeing the emperor's ears, but when Trojan asked him what he had observed, he answered him, ""I did not observe anything."" The emperor gave him twelve ducats, and said to him, ""From that moment you will always come to shave me."""
"There was a king long ago in Ireland. He had three sons, and one of them was stupid. The king was sick, and he called his three sons. He told them that he knew that he would only cure him of the apples of Burnett's orchard. So he asked them to go and get them, for this orchard was in a distant place, and no one could say so. Then the three sons went, and took their horses, and put their bridles on, and went away, and went up to three junctions. They went up to three junctions. There they stopped, and they settled between them that each of them would take one of the roads and go to pick up the apples, and they gathered at the same place at the end of a year and a day."
"One day he lived in a small city in China, a man named Hok Lee. He was a stable and hard-working man, who not only worked hard in his trade, but also in all his household work, because he lived alone. ""What an excellent and industrialized man is this Hok Lee!"" said his neighbors. ""How hard he works! He never leaves his house to have fun or to take a vacation as others do!"" Hok Lee was by no means the virtuous person his neighbors thought. Certainly, he worked hard enough by day, but at night, when all the respectable people slept fast, he flew and joined a dangerous gang of thieves, who broke into the homes of the rich and took away everything they could put in hand. This state of affairs continued for a while, and although a thief was caught from time to time and after and punished, no suspicion ever fell on Hok Lee, he was a very respectable man, hard to work."
"When the old woman reached her cabin, she sat by the door and threw herself, for she knew that she had no means to defend herself against the boar. As she sat down crying for a needle-seller, she came to ask her what was there. She told her, but all he could do for her was to give her a box of needles. The old woman sticked the needles thickly on the lower half of the door, on her outer side, and continued to cry. A man then came with a basket of crabs, heard her lamentations, and stopped to ask her what was there. She told her, but he said that he knew nothing about her, but he would do his best for her by giving her half of her crabs."
"Nagari was very troubled by this word, and marveled a lot. Then a woman rose up, and said, ""I will come again, and she went to get the sweet music."" This woman never returned. After a while, another woman rose up and said, ""Stay here, my friends; I will come back."" Then she went as if to seek the music. And she did not come back. And with every woman, until Nagari was left sitting alone as he had been in the beginning. Now Webubu was still playing his flute on the tray that he had built in the cork, when the women came in sight. He was alarmed for the safety of his frail platform, when he saw these many people move forward, and he cried, ""Come not into the tree. Please stay below, O women!"" But the women were eagerly consumed to be close to the music that had taken their heart, and they climbed, all of them, until they were on the plateau of Webubu."
"The Battle of England was an attack by the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) against Great Britain during the summer and fall of 1940. The first objective of the campaign was to take control of the air space over Great Britain by the Royal Air Force (RAF), in particular the Fighter Command. The name comes from a famous speech by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons: ""The Battle of France is over. I expect the Battle of England to begin..."" The Battle of England was the first major campaign to be conducted entirely by the air forces and was also the largest and longest aerial bombing campaign to date."
"The Battle of Saratoga is considered the turning point of the American Revolution. The battle was fought at the end of 1777. I. In fact, these are two commitments: the Battle of Freeman's Farm (19 September) and the Battle of Bemis Heights (7 October). The Americans were led by General Horatio Gates. The British were led by General John Burgoyne. On 17 October, Burgoyne handed over his army of nearly 6,000 British soldiers. The American victory helped France come to the rescue of the Continental Army. It also helped them recognize the United States. At the beginning of 1777, General William Howe asked London to approve his plan of attack on Philadelphia."
"The Battle of Waterloo was a battle that was fought mainly between the French and British forces. Napoleon was crowned Emperor of France in 1804. Then he launched numerous successful attacks against other European countries. France soon had an empire extending from Spain to the Russian border. The only country that was still uncaptured was Great Britain. The Royal Navy had many ships, so that the invasion of France was not possible. However, Britain was not strong enough to prevent Napoleon and his army from taking over most of continental Europe. Napoleon seemed unstoppable until two separate campaigns brought down his empire."
"Many people like to learn about their family stories: what their parents, grandparents and even grandparents were like and from where they came from, or if they are related to an important historical person. Or, they might like to know if a physical characteristic or behavior they share with an aunt or cousin has been transmitted from a common parent. Scientists called paleoanthropologists, are interested in the family history of Homo sapiens, the species to which all people live today. Unlike paleoanthropologists who study the remains of dinosaurs, scientific paleoanthropologists who study the remains of ancient humans and their relatives, study the remains of hominins, a group of primates that includes humans and all their ancestors and missing parents."
"Large data is a term that refers to data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, research, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating and confidentiality of information. The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analyses, user behaviour analyses, or some other advanced data analysis methods that derive data value, and rarely to a particular size of data set."
"Biodiesel is an exclusive blend of biodiesel and conventional heating oil. Biodiesel is a registered trademark of the National Biodiesel Board [NBB] and the National Oilheat Research Alliance [NORA] in the United States, and the Columbia Fuels in Canada. Heating biodiesel is available in various mixtures. ASTM 396 recognizes that mixtures of up to 5 percent biodiesel equivalent to pure oil. Mixtures of more than 20 percent biofuel are used by many consumers. Research is underway to determine whether such mixtures affect performance."
"Biodiversity, a contraction of ""biological diversity"", generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. This is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can relate to genetic variation, ecosystem variation or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which appears to be the result of warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not evenly distributed on Earth."
"In fact, the cultivation of plants can be considered the first biotechnological enterprise. Agriculture has been theorized to become the dominant mode of food production since the Neolithic Revolution. Thanks to primitive biotechnology, the first farmers chose and cultivated the most appropriate crops, with the highest yields, to produce enough food to sustain a growing population. As crops and fields become larger and more difficult to maintain, it has been discovered that organisms and their by-products can actually fertilize, restore nitrogen and control pests."
"The study of the Arctic and the organisms that live there is extremely difficult because this ocean is largely inaccessible. For much of the year, the thick ice prevents ships from entering and the weather is too harsh to carry out experiments. As a result, we see only snapshots of the processes that occur in the Arctic, mainly during the summer months. The conditions in the Arctic Ocean are hostile, with long cold winters and short cool summers. Average air temperatures in winter can fall to -34°C and rise to 10°C in summer, although the ocean temperature remains stable at about -1.5 to -3°C. Most of the water is enclosed as ice. Depending on the distance from the north, there may be up to almost half a year of complete darkness during the winter, or 24 hours of day during the summer. Many microbes live or are attached under sea ice. The ice that forms on the Arctic Ocean is not as strong as you might think."
"Bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto introduced the idea on October 31, 2008 to a cryptography mailing list, and published it as open source software in 2009. There have been several high profile claims to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto; however, none of them has undoubtedly provided proof that to safeguard their claims. The system is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a large public distributed book called the blockchain, which uses Bitcoin as a unit of account. Since the system operates without a central deposit or single administrator, the US Treasury class Bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency. Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency, although earlier systems existed and it is more accurately described as the first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value."
"A black hole is a time region of space with gravitational effects so strong that nothing – including particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from the inside. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can distort the time of space to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which it is not possible to escape is called the horizon of the event. Although crossing the horizon of the event has a huge effect on the fate of the object passing through it, it does not seem to have locally detectable characteristics."
"A blockade should not be confused with an embargo or sanctions, which are legal barriers to trade. It is also distinct from a siege in that a blockade is generally directed towards a country or a whole region, rather than a fortress or a city. Although most of the blockades have historically taken place at sea, the blockade is still used on land to prevent someone from entering a certain area. A blocking power may seek to cut off any shipping from and to the blocked country; although stopping any land transportation to and from an area may also be considered a blockade. Blockages restrict the commercial rights of neutrals, who must undergo an inspection for smuggling, which the blocking power can narrowly or broadly define, including sometimes food and medicine."
"The blood is pushed through the body by the heart, and brings nutrients and oxygen to our tissues. It also removes waste and carbon dioxide from the tissues. The blood of vertebrates consists of blood plasma and various cells — red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Platelets help blood clot. Hemoglobin is in the red blood cells. White blood cells help fight infections and heal wounds. Blood plasma is the yellow liquid in which the blood cells float. Plasma is composed of nutrients, electrolytes (salt), gas, non-protein hormones, waste, lipids and proteins. These proteins are albumin, antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins), coagulation factors and protein hormones. Plasma that does not have fibrinogenic protein is called serum and cannot clot. Adults have about 3 litres of plasma."
"Bluetooth is a protocol for wireless communication over short distances. It was developed in the 1990s, to reduce the number of cables. Devices such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers, digital cameras and video game consoles can connect to each other, and exchange information. This is done using radio waves. It can be done safely. Bluetooth is used only for relatively short distances, like a few meters. There are different standards. Data rates vary. Currently, they are at 1-3 MBit per second. Typical Bluetooth applications are connecting a helmet to a mobile phone, or connecting a computer mouse, keyboard or printer."
"The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid turns into a vapour. The boiling point of a liquid varies according to the surrounding ambient pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum has a boiling point lower than when the liquid is at atmospheric pressure. A high-pressure liquid has a boiling point higher than when the liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For a given pressure, different boiling liquids at different temperatures. The normal boiling point (also referred to as the atmospheric boiling point or atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case where the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure defined at sea level, 1 atmosphere. At this temperature, the vapour pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome the atmospheric pressure and allow the formation of vapour bubbles within most of the liquid."
"The Boston Tea Party (originally called by John Adams ""Tea Destruction in Boston"") was a political demonstration by the Sons of Liberty in Boston on December 16, 1773. The demonstrators, some of whom appropriated the Native American dress, in disregard of the Tea Act of May 10, 1773, destroyed a whole shipment of tea sent by the East India Company. They took the ships and threw the tea chests into Boston Harbor. The British government reacted harshly and the episode intensified in the American revolution. The Tea Party became an emblematic event of American history, and other political demonstrations such as the Tea Party movement after 2010 explicitly refer to it. The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been adopted by the British Parliament in 1773. The settlers opposed the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as English to ""No tax without representation"", which is, to be imposed only by their own elected representatives and not by their own British parliament."
"Brain implants, often called neural implants, are technological devices that connect directly to the brain of a biological subject – usually placed on the surface of the brain, or attached to the brain cortex. The common objective of modern brain implants and the object of many current research is to establish a biomedical prosthesis bypassing areas of the brain that have become dysfunctional after stroke or other brain damage. This includes sensory substitution, e.g. in vision. Other brain implants are used in animal experiments simply to record brain activity for scientific reasons. Some brain implants involve the creation of interfaces between neuronal systems and computer chips."
"In the telecommunications field, broadband is a broadband data transmission capable of simultaneously carrying several signals and traffic types. The medium can be a coaxial cable, fibre optics, radio or twisted pair. In the context of Internet access, broadband is used to designate any high-speed Internet access that is always activated and faster than traditional dial-up access. Different criteria for ""broadband"" have been applied in different contexts and at different times. Its origin is in physics, acoustics and radio system engineering, where it was used with a meaning similar to that of ""broadband"". Later, with the advent of digital telecommunications, the term was mainly used for transmission on several channels."
"The first regular television programs began in 1937. The programs can be classified as ""recorded"" or ""live."" The first is to correct errors, remove unnecessary or unwanted material, reorganize it, apply slow movements and repetitions, and other techniques to improve the program. However, some live events such as sports television may include some of the aspects, including slow motion clips, of important objectives/cuts, etc., between over-the-air television. U.S. radio broadcasters typically banned pre-recorded broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s requiring radio broadcasts for eastern and central time zones to be repeated three hours later for the Pacific time zone. This restriction was abandoned for special occasions, as in the case of the German airship dirigible Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst, New Jersey, in 1937. During the Second World War, pre-recorded broadcasts of war correspondents were authorized on U.S. radio."
"The bronze age is a period characterized by the use of bronze, proto-writing, and other early characteristics of urban civilization. The bronze age is the second main period of the three-year-old bronze-iron system, as proposed in modern times by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, to classify and study ancient societies. An ancient civilization is defined to be in the bronze age either by merging its own copper and alloy with tin, arsenic, or other metals, or by exchanging for bronze areas of production elsewhere. Copper-tin ores are rare, as shown by the fact that there was no tin bronze in Western Asia before the bronze trade began in the third millennium BC. Throughout the world, the bronze age usually follows the neolithic period, with the Chalcolithic service as a transition."
"The first step in determining whether something is useful or harmful to human health is to design a study. Basically, if you want to assess the link between a risk factor and a particular disease, you have two options: you can start with the risk factor and try to link it to the disease, or start with the disease and try to return to the risk factor that caused it. First, let's talk about starting from the disease and trying to identify the risk factor. We will continue with our example of tobacco. If you think that tobacco causes lung cancer, you can go to the hospital and ask lung cancer patients if they smoke or smoke. This information is not very useful in itself, because we need to compare it with information from healthy people without lung cancer."
"In science, buoyancy (also known as thrust) is an ascending force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of a submerged object. In a fluid column, the pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid that covers. Thus, the pressure at the bottom of a fluid column is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This difference in pressure results in a clear upward force on the object. The magnitude of this force exerted is proportional to this difference in pressure, and (as explained by the Archimedes principle) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, that is, the displaced fluid. For this reason, an object whose density is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to flow."
"When you go to the beach, discover those who have rescuers. Always try to visit the beaches that have rescuers looking at the swimmers. Service rescuers will put red and yellow flags on the beach to show you where it is safe to swim. Many people have trouble seeing a pull-out current in the sea. Flow currents are like rivers that can draw even strong swimmers away from the beach. That's why it's better to swim between the rescuers' flags. If you're pulled by a pull-out current, try not to panic. Try to swim left or right of the current flow. Do not try to fight the current or swim against the current. It will make you tired and more afraid. To be safe when you visit the beach, you should always listen to the rescuers. And make sure you stay between the red and yellow flags on the beach. Flags show where the currents are safe."
"The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during the end of Antiquity and the Middle Ages, while its capital was Constantinople (now Istanbul, originally founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for a thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. For most of its existence, the Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural and military force in Europe."
"In some countries, the cabinet is called ""Council of Ministers"" or ""Council of Government"" or less known names such as ""Federal Council"" (in Switzerland), ""Inner Council"" or ""High Council"". These countries may differ from the way in which the cabinet is used or established. In some countries, especially those using a parliamentary system (for example, the United Kingdom), the Cabinet collectively decides the direction of the government, particularly with regard to legislation adopted by Parliament. In countries with a presidential system, such as the United States, the Cabinet does not function as a collective legislative influence; rather, its main role is to formally advise the head of government."
"It is an alkaline earth metal. Its melting point is warmer than most other reactive metals. It is a little harder than lead. It has two allotropes. It does not drive electricity as well as copper, but it is much lighter by weight. It reacts with water to produce hydrogen and calcium hydroxide. It reacts with water very quickly when it is powdered. When it is powdered, it starts to react slowly because calcium hydroxide makes a coating that does not dissolve on calcium. If a little acid is added to calcium hydroxide, it dissolves it, which makes calcium very fast. It burns when it is powdered to produce a reddish flame. This makes calcium oxide. It also renders calcium nitride when it is heated. It can react with halogens to make calcium halides like calcium chloride with chlorine."
"Carbohydrates are an important form of energy storage and transport in most organisms, including plants and animals. Carbohydrates are the most common source of energy for the human body. Proteins build tissues and cells in the body. Carbohydrates are very good for energy, but if a person eats more than necessary, addition is changed to fat. If necessary, humans can live without eating carbohydrates because the human body can change proteins to carbohydrates. People in some crops eat foods with very few carbohydrates, but they remain healthy."
"Carbon dioxide (CO2 chemical formula) is a colourless and odourless gas vital to life on Earth. This natural chemical compound consists of a carbon atom covalently bound to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in the Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) per volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is released from carbonaceous rocks by dissolution into water and acids. As carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, ice caps and glaciers, as well as seawater. It is present in oil and natural gas deposits."
"Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of carbon-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), as when using a stove or internal combustion engine in a closed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide. Coal gas, which was widely used before the 1960s for household lighting, cooking and heating, had carbon monoxide as an important component of the fuel."
"Cocoa is native to the Amazonian region of South America. Since its origin, cocoa has evolved into different types as it has grown in different geographical populations. Two populations of cocoa, of different origins, were originally assumed to exist: one from Central America and the other from South America. These two groups were first recognized as two subspecies, cocoa and sphaerocarpum, which were also recognized as the two types of cocoa most commonly known as Criollo and Forastero, respectively. These subspecies differed not only in the area where they developed, but also in some of their morphological characteristics."
"Brain functions, such as perceptions, thoughts and feelings, are the result of communication between neurons. To effectively communicate and process information, neurons form connections between them. Through these connections, they exchange information via messenger molecules. There are many messenger systems in the brain. They consist of two main actors: a set of molecules that act as keys (called ligands) and another set of molecules that act as locks (called receptors). Each receptor has a specific ligand as each lock has a specific key. All messenger systems also have molecules called enzymes to break excess ligands to keep messengers always in the right quantity. Most messenger systems communicate in one direction, where ligand is released from neuron 1 and binds to receptors on neuron 2. There are also some that communicate in the opposite direction, from neuron 2 to neuron 1."
"A market crop is an agricultural crop that is grown for sale to earn a profit. It is generally purchased by separate parts of a farm. The term is used to differentiate commercialized crops from subsistence crops, which are those that are fed to the producer's livestock or cultivated as food for the producer's family. Previously, commercial crops were generally only a small (but essential) part of the total yield of a farm, whereas today, especially in developed countries, almost all crops are grown primarily for revenue purposes.In the least developed countries, commercial crops are generally crops that attract demand in the most developed countries and therefore have some export value."
"The cathode ray tube or CRT was invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun. It was the most common type of display in many years. It was used in almost all computer screens and televisions until LCD and plasma screens began to be used. A cathode ray tube is an electronic cannon. The cathode is an electrode (a metal that can send electrons when heated). The cathode is inside a glass tube. The inside of the glass tube is also an anode that attracts electrons. This is used to pull electrons forward of the glass tube, so the electrons pull in a direction, like a ray gun."
"The Celts were people of the Iron Age and medieval Europe who spoke Celtic languages and had cultural similarities, although the relationship between ethnic, linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial. The exact geographical distribution of the ancient Celtic is also disputed; in particular, the way in which the people of the Iron Age of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celtic has become a subject of controversy. The history of pre-Celtic Europe remains very uncertain. According to one theory, the common root of Celtic languages, a language known as protoceltic, emerged in the Urnfield culture of the Late Bronze Age of Central Europe, which flourished from about 1200 BC."
"The central powers were a group of nations fighting against the Allied Powers during the First World War; the members included Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria and their territories; they were also supported by Azerbaijan and Finland, as well as Lithuania in 1918 and the cobelliger Jabal Shammar; they lost the war; the allied forces included Great Britain, Canada, Newfoundland, Russia, France, later the United States, Greece, Portugal, Brazil, Georgia, Armenia, Australia and even Japan; Italy joined the allies in the middle of the First World War, even though all they wanted was to obtain colonies; this greed lasted until the Second World War, but Italy won nothing."
"A central processing unit (CPU) is an important part of almost every computer. The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of the computer, almost like the way a brain controls a body. The CPU is an electronic machine that works on a list of things to do, called instructions. It reads the list of instructions and does (executes) each in order. A list of instructions that a CPU can run is a computer program. The speed at which a CPU works is measured in hertz (Hz). Modern processors often work so fast that gigahertz (GHz) is used instead. A gigahertz is one billion cycles per second. Most of the CPUs used in (domestic) desktop computers are either manufactured by Intel or Advanced Micro Devices (usually shortened to AMD)."
"Chanri and Boipelo go to an adventure around South Africa. Their journey starts in Kimberley, North Cape. In Kimberley you will find the Big Hole! Tjoeke buffoon toot-toot, they travel to Cape Town in West Cape. Chanri and Boipelo pick juicy grapes in the farms. Tjoeke buffoon toot-toot, then they go to Bhisho, East Cape. The two friends have fun at Elephant Park! Tjoeke buffoon toot-toot, they pass through the Free State. They admire all the pretty flowery roses in Bloemfontein. On Mahikeng, in the North West. The train slows down to meet Rina the rhino at National Park. Then our friends rushed to Polokwane, in Limpopo. Toot-toot-toot-toot-toot! They run late, so the train doesn't stop in Johannesburg, Gauteng. From the train they see a lot of cars and people busy in this city."
"Because grammar is so difficult for people who learn a foreign language, we tried to find ways to help people learn grammar. We first thought about how people can become good at memorizing vocabulary. Do you still remember how to say ""the cat"" in French? Take a second and see if you can find it without looking back at the example! So? Do you remember what ""the cat"" is in French? If you guess ""the cat"", you would be right! Unless you were already speaking French, it was probably a difficult question. The reason is that we asked you to find the word in a foreign language. For most of you, who are familiar enough with English to be able to read this article, it would have been easier if we had asked you on the other side — asking what the French words ""the cat"" mean in English or in another language you know."
"A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that allows the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite loads, or from the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are ""strong bonds"" such as covalent or ionic bonds and ""low bonds"" such as dipolar-dipolar interaction, London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding. Since the opposite charges attract by a simple electromagnetic force, the negatively charged electrons that orbit the nucleus and positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each other. An electron between two nuclei will be attracted by them, and the nuclei will be attracted to the electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the chemical bond. Due to the nature of the electrons' matter waves and their smallest mass, they must occupy a much larger amount of volume in relation to the nuclei, and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei relatively distant, in relation to the size of the nuclei themselves."
"After the fall of the Qing dynasty at the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, the country was plunged into turmoil. In the vacuum of power that followed, a large number of warlords seized control of various parts of the country. In order to defeat them and unify the country, Sun Yat-sen and the KMT sought the help of foreign governments. Although he pleaded with several Western democratic nations, none offered any help. It was only after turning to the Soviet Union in 1921 that Sun found help. The Communist Soviet Union agreed to help the KMT, provided that the small Chinese Communist Party was allowed to join it. In 1923, the Soviet Union, the KMT and the CCP reached an agreement, the Sun-Joffe manifesto, which said that the Soviet Union would help China to have a government and not many governments."
"Many people in Western Europe wanted to find a shorter way to get to Asia. Columbus thought he could go to Asia by sailing to the west. He did not know about the Western Hemisphere, so he did not know that it would prevent him from going to Asia. However, Columbus did not have enough money to pay himself for this trip. After defeating the Emirate of Granada, the leaders of Spain, Ferdinand II and Isabella I of Castilla, agreed to pay for the trip. He promised to bring gold and spices for them. In August 1492, Columbus and his sailors left Spain in three ships: the Santa María (the Holy Mary), the Pinta (the Painting) and the Santa Clara (named the Niña: the Little Girl). The three ships were very small. Historians thought that the largest ship, the Santa María, had only 60 feet (18 metres) long, and about 16 to 19 feet (4.8 to 5.8 metres) wide. The other ships of Columbus were still smaller."
"In the early 1900s, scientists discovered how to transform nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into nitrogen-containing compounds that could be used to fertilize soils. This industrial fixation is called the Haber-Bosch process. Almost all nitrogen in industrial fertilizers is fixed by the Haber-Bosch process. This industrial fixation of nitrogen is carried out in chemical laboratories and large factories all over the world. The Haber-Bosch process requires that nitrogen gas be mixed with hydrogen gas (H2) and placed under enormous pressure (200 times the atmospheric pressure). This is the pressure you would feel if you travel 2000 metres (~6 500 feet) below the sea, which is a distance longer than 6 Eiffel Towers stacked on each other! This mixture of pressure gas is then heated to very high temperatures (450°C/842°F)."
"Civic technology is the technology (mainly information technology) that allows for public engagement or participation for stronger development, improved citizen communications, improved government infrastructure and, in general, improved public good. It includes civic applications, support platforms for government agencies, institutions and other software to enable these objectives. The definition of what constitutes civic technology is challenged to some extent, particularly with respect to companies engaged in the sharing or access economy, such as Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. For example, Airbnb's ability to provide housing to residents of New York during the Superstorm Sandy period could be seen as a form of civic technology."
"Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles to solve the problems of society, and its history is closely linked to the progress of the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history. Because civil engineering is an extensive profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to the knowledge of structures, the sciences of materials, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, the environment, mechanics and other fields. Throughout ancient and medieval history, most architectural designs and constructions have been carried out by artisans, such as stone masons and carpenters, who have achieved the role of master builder."
"Civil law, civil law or Roman law is a legal system originating in Europe, intellectual within the framework of late Roman law, and the most common feature of which is that its fundamental principles are codified in a referendum system which serves as the main source of law. It can be contrasted with systems of common law whose intellectual framework comes from the decision-making law handed down by a judge, which gives authority to previous judicial decisions on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions (doctrine of the judicial precedent, or fixed decisis). Historically, a civil law is the group of ideas and legal systems ultimately derived from the Justinian Code, but strongly overtaken by the Napoleonian, Germanic, canonical, feudal and local rules, as well as doctrinal constraints such as natural law, codification and legal positivism."
"In many countries, civil rights include freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly; civil rights also include the right to property and the right to fair and equal treatment by government, other citizens and private groups; they can prevent discrimination on the grounds of race, sexual orientation and sex; civil rights are protected by law and customs; the constitutions of many democracies have a Bill of Rights that describes the freedoms and rights of the people; a well-known example is the United States Bill of Rights; a court decides whether a person's civil rights have been violated; courts also decide on the limits of civil rights, so that people do not use their freedoms to remove the rights of others."
"The Great Canyon has been formed by the Colorado River. There are many such large rivers. There are many rivers that are much larger. The Mississippi River is the largest river in the United States. Only Colorado has formed such a large canyon. The Grand Canyon is its own league. In most cases, the water is harmless. Over time, the water can have a great effect. When the water flows on the earth, it can wash the ground. With enough time, it can sculpt through the rock. With enough time, it can create a canyon on a mile wide. It is difficult to believe that the water created the Grand Canyon. Scientists have learned that the Grand Canyon has taken a long time to form. Every time it rained, the water has crossed the ground. A little soil and rock have been taken away by every rainstorm. Water can cause a lot of change if it has time."
"The epidermis is the outer layer of the skin. There are no blood vessels, nerve endings or glands in this layer of skin. Although it does not seem to it, this layer of skin is very active. It is constantly renewed. How does this happen? The cells at the bottom of this layer are always produced. New cells move slowly towards the surface. When the cells reach the surface, they are dead. It is true, the outer layer of your skin is dead. Don't worry, that's what forms the protective layer. This outer layer is even waterproof. Dead cells are gradually falling. At the moment they are scattered, they are replaced by other dead cells. The epidermis also contains cells that give its skin color. These cells are what produces the brown pigment in the skin. The skin of everyone has about the same number of these cells. However, these cells of people with darker skin produce more pigment. The amount of pigment depends on two things."
"Science shows that hearing loss also affects cognitive skills (such as thinking, learning, memory or attention). Babies with hearing loss learn differently than babies who can hear. It is not because they are not smart or can't do things that other babies can do. It is because the world is different for them that it is for someone who can hear. In our study, we wanted to know whether being born deaf affects visual treatment. Visual treatment is the way our brain understands what we see with our eyes. It is an important cognitive ability. By studying visual treatment in deaf babies, we can learn more about how hearing loss affects how these babies learn and grow."
"The climate means the usual state of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation and other meteorological elements in a region of the Earth's surface for a long time. The climate is different from the weather. The weather is the state of these elements at this time, for shorter periods of up to two weeks. Latitude, soil and height can change the climate of a place. It is also important to note whether the oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. The climates are most often classified by temperature and precipitation. The climate classification of Köppen is the climate classification of Köppen, first made by Wladimir Köppen. The Thorntwaite system, which was used from 1948 onwards, uses not only information on temperature and precipitation, but also evapotranspiration."
"In computing, cloud computing describes a type of outsourcing of IT services, similar to how electricity supply is outsourced. Users can simply use it. They don't need to worry about the origin of electricity, how it is manufactured or transported. Each month, they pay for what they consume. The idea behind cloud computing is similar: The user can simply use storage, computing power or specially designed development environments, without having to worry about how these environments work internally. Cloud computing is generally based on the Internet. Cloud computing is a metaphor for the Internet based on how the Internet is described in computer network diagrams; which means that it is an abstraction that hides the complex infrastructure of the Internet."
"In February 1917, the Tsar (King) Nicholas II of the Russian Empire was overthrown because people were dissatisfied with their living conditions, especially during the First World War. The new government in Russia was a democratic socialist government. Unfortunately, it was ineffective, and people were still unhappy. In November 1917, a communist group called the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin overturned the new government. They were supported by groups of workers called Soviets. The Bolsheviks created a new communist government called the Russian Soviet Socialist Federal Republic (called simply Soviet Russia or Russian SFSR). However, not everyone supported the Communists. Many countries that had been part of the Russian Empire had left, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Finland. The Russian civil war began, with the ""Red Army"" of the Russian SFSR fighting against the ""White Army"", the group of all Russians against the Communists."
"A collimator is a device that narrows a beam of particles or waves. Shrunking can mean either making the directions of movement more aligned in a specific direction (i.e. making collimated light or parallel rays), or making the space section of the beam become smaller (beam limiting device). An English physicist Henry Kater was the inventor of the floating collimator, which rendered a great service to practical astronomy. He reported on his invention in January 1825. In his report, Kater mentioned earlier work in this field by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Friedrich Bessel. In optics, a collimator may be made up of a mirror or a curved lens with a certain type of light source and/or an image at its centre of interest."
"The Colosseum, originally known as the Flavian amphitheatre, is a great amphitheatre in the city of Rome. The construction of the Colosseum began around 70–72 after JC and was completed in 80 AD. Emperor Vespasian began the work, and Emperor Titus completed them. Emperor Domitian made some changes in the building between 81–96 JC. He had seats for 50,000 people. It was 156 meters wide, 189 meters long and 57 meters high. It was the largest amphitheatre built by the Roman Empire. The Colosseum was first called the Flavian or Latin amphitheater, the flavium amphitheater. It was after Vespasian and Titus who had the family name Flavius. It was used for competitions of gladiatorie, and other shows as animal hunts, in which the animals would hunt and eat prisoners; or in which the battles of the scenes were fought; and in which the gladiators were also fighting against the scenes."
"A compass is an instrument used for navigation and orientation that shows the direction relative to the geographical ""cardial directions"". Usually, a diagram called rose compass shows the directions north, south, east and west as abbreviated initials marked on the compass. When the compass is used, the rose can be aligned with the corresponding geographical directions, so that, for example, the mark ""N"" on the rose really indicates to the north. Often, in addition to the rose or sometimes instead of the rose, angle marks in degrees are displayed on the compass. The north corresponds to zero degrees, and the angles increase in the direction of the hands of a watch, so that the east is 90 degrees, the south is 180 degrees, and the west is 270. These figures allow the compass to show azimuts or bearings, which are commonly mentioned in this notation."
"Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, hard disk (HDD), graphics cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, etc., all of which are tangible physical objects. On the other hand, the software is instructions that can be stored and managed by hardware. The software is a set of machine-readable instructions that directs the processor of a computer to perform specific operations. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computer system. The model for all modern computers is the Von Neumann architecture, detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing a record of instructions and a program counter, a memory for storing both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms."
"A computer program is a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Everything that a computer does is done by using a computer program. A computer program is written in a programming language. Some examples of computer programs: A web browser like Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari can be used to display web pages on the Internet. A desktop suite can be used to write documents or spreadsheets. Video games are computer programs. A computer program is stored as a file on the computer's hard drive. When the user runs the program, the file is read by the computer, and the processor reads the data in the file as a list of instructions. Then, the computer does what the program tells him. A computer program is written by a programmer. It is very difficult to write in either machine code zeros, which is what the computer can read, so that computer programmers can write in a programming language, like BASIC, C or Java. Once a computer is using a computer, it can transform the computer into a written one. Once a computer can understand the computer."
"A computer platform is, in the most general sense, whatever a pre-existing element of a computer software or code object is designed to operate inside, obeying its constraints, and using its installations. The term computer platform can refer to different levels of abstraction, including a certain hardware architecture, operating system (OS) and running libraries. In total, it can be said that this is the stage on which computer programs can operate. Binary executables must be compiled for a specific hardware platform, since the different central processors have different machine codes. In addition, operating systems and running libraries allow the reuse of code and provide abstraction layers that allow the same high-level source code to operate on a differently configured hardware. For example, there are many types of data storage devices, and any computer may have a different configuration of storage devices; but the application is able to call a generic backup or writing function provided by the operating libraries themselves, which deal with the details of the operation and operation."
"A concentration camp (or internment camp) is a place where a government forces many people to live. Usually, these people belong to groups that the government does not like. The government may think that these people are its enemies. In the past, governments have also put people in concentration camps because they belong to a certain religion, race, or ethnic group. Usually, people are sent to concentration camps without having been tried or convicted of a crime. Sometimes governments send people to concentration camps to do forced labour or to be killed. For example, the most well-known concentration camps were run by Nazi Germany during the Second World War."
"Conservatism is the opposition to rapid changes and promotes the maintenance of traditions in society. Gradualism is a form. The first known use of the term in a political context was by François-René de Chateaubriand in 1818. It was at the time of the restoration of Bourbon that the policies of the French Revolution were sought to reverse. The term is associated with right-wing politics. It was used to describe a wide range of points of view. There is not a single set of policies that are considered conservative, because the meaning of conservatism depends on a given place and time. Conservatism tends to support the notion of faith, especially in the Abrahamic traditions in countries where they are the main religions."
"A constellation is a group of stars, usually in a recognizable form or pattern. When viewed together at the same time, the stars look like an image. The word constellation comes from Latin: con-, meaning together and stella - meaning stars. Some examples of constellations are Ursa Major, Orion, and Andromeda. There are only 88 constellations discovered so far by astronomers. Constellations have been used to tell the difference in colors. Constellations have also been used to group stars. Different places in the world may have different constellations, but today astronomy has a fixed set of 88 constellations. This set is based on the Greek whole and later some constellations from the south have been added, for example Antlia - the air pump. Most constellations have names that come from Greek mythology, such as Orion or Andromeda. There are 12 constellations in the Zodiac. The Sun travels through the Zodiac once every year."
"Copper is used in the manufacture of wires because it is easy to stretch and it is not expensive. That's why the big wire companies will use copper because it is cheaper and takes less time to get copper can be the oldest used metal, as very old copper tools have been found. Copper is used in electrical wiring. It can also be shaped in different parts. It can be used in a heat sink. The Statue of Liberty is made of copper. It is also used in pipes carrying water, because it does not corrode. When people mix copper with tin, bronze is made. Bronze is much more difficult, and created the bronze age. It has become less important when people learn to use iron better. When zinc is mixed with copper, brass is made, which is even harder than bronze."
"Coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which are made up of polyps that are grouped into groups. Polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletals that support and protect coral polyps. Most reefs develop better in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated waters. Often called ""sea forests"", shallow coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, about half of the region of France, but they harbour at least 25% of all marine species, including fish, molluscs, worms, crustaceans, sponges and other species."
"Covalent bonds are chemical bonds between two non-metallic atoms. One example is water, where hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) bind together to make (H2O). As they are both non-metallic – which must win electrons – they must share, so that their outer shells cross to have a complete outer shell. An outer shell has eight electrons. The electrons in this outer shell are called valence electrons. The number of valence electrons is determined by the size of the atom. The electrons orbit an atomic nucleus in the same way as the planets orbit the stars. There are layers of paths around an atomic nucleus. The first layer always contains only two electrons, while the layers after which usually contain up to eight."
"Creationism is the belief that the universe was created in the way described in religious books. According to Genesis, God directly created life from the nothingness that was before, by fixing the chaos that was. Other religions have different myths of creation. The first approach is known as creatio ex nihilo, which is the Latin name for creation from nothing. The idea that God created the world was taught for thousands of years by writers like Augustine de Hippo. Creationism as it is known today began in the 19th century by fundamentalist Protestants who were opposed to the the theories that scientists began to put forward on geology and evolution. In the 20th century, the creationist movements also started in Islam and Judaism."
"Traditionally, they took place between 1095 and 1291. The Holy Land was and remains a very important place for the three great monotheistic religions: Islam, Judaism and Christianity. There are many important religious sites in the Holy Land. It is the land now called Israel or Palestine. Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem and other religious sites fell under the control of Muslims during the Caliphate of Omar (634-44). There were many different crusades. The most important and the largest crusades took place from the 11th century to the 13th century. There were 9 great crusades during this period. They were numbered 1 to 9. There were also many small crusades. Some crusades were even in Europe (for example, Germany, Austria and Scandinavia). Small crusades continued until the 16th century, until the Renaissance and the Reformation."
"A crystal or a crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents, such as atoms, molecules or ions, are arranged in a highly orderly microscopic structure, forming a crystalline network that extends in all directions. In addition, macroscopic monoscopic crystals are generally identifiable by their geometric form, consisting of flat faces with specific and characteristic orientations. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. The crystal formation process by crystal growth mechanisms is called crystallization or solidification. The word crystal is derived from the ancient Greek word krustallos, which means both ""ice"" and ""rock crystal"", from kruos, ""cold icy, gel"". Examples of large crystals include snowflakes, diamonds and table salt. Most inorganic solids are not crystals but polycrystalline, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused into a single solid. Examples of polycrystalline crystals include most metals, rocks, ice and ice."
"Cuneiform writing is one of the first known systems of writing. It uses corner-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by a reed stylus. The cuneiform name itself means ""edge shape"", the Latin cuneus ""edge"" and the forma ""form"". It came to the English use probably of the former French cuneiform. It was first used in Sumer at the end of the 4th millennium BC (period ""Uruk IV""). Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictograms. In the third millennium, the signs became simplified and more abstract."
"In December 2019, several patients in Wuhan, China, reportedly suffered from unknown viral pneumonia. Shortly thereafter, other patients in this city were diagnosed with the same disease. On January 9, scientists identified a new virus as the cause of the mysterious disease. They discovered that the new virus belongs to a class of viruses called coronavirus, and therefore they called it SARS-CoV-2. The name comes from the disease that it causes: severe acute respiratory syndrome; CoV represents the coronavirus, and number 2 was added because it is the second coronavirus that causes a serious respiratory disease. Then, scientists examined the DNA of the virus that they recovered from a sick person and the results were surprising. They discovered that the new virus infecting humans is very similar to a coronavirus found in bats (96%)."
"Black matter is a type of unidentified matter that includes approximately 27% of the mass and energy of the observable universe and is not attributable to black energy, baronic matter (ordinary matter) and neutrinos. The name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light, and is therefore invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Although black matter has not been observed directly, its existence and properties are derived from its gravitational effects such as the movements of visible matter, the gravitational lens, its influence on the large-scale structure of the universe and its effects on the cosmic background of the microwave."
"Because dark matter does not seem to give or reflect light, X-rays or any other radiation, the instruments that are used to find normal matter (such as hot gas, stars, planets and we) cannot find black matter. It seems that black matter is not done the same as the matter we see every day on Earth. The only way to say if black matter is there is by how it affects things that we can ""see"" by gravity. In 2006, a group of scientists said that they had found a way to find black matter. Since black matter is supposed to be very different from normal matter, it should act differently. Scientists observed two distant clusters of galaxy that had crashed at high speed: normal matter would have been scattered near the collision, while black matter would not. By measuring gravity, they were able to detect what looked like two clouds of dark matter, with a cloud of normal matter (hot gas) between them."
"The visualization of data or the visualization of data is regarded by many disciplines as a modern equivalent of visual communication, involving the creation and study of the visual representation of data, i.e. ""information that has been extracted in a schematic form, including attributes or variables for information units."" The main objective of the visualization of data is to communicate the information in a clear and effective way through statistical graphs, graphs and information graphs. Digital data can be coded using points, lines or bars to communicate a quantitative message visually. Effective visualization helps users analyze and reason for data and evidence. It makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable."
"A database engine can sort, modify or serve the information on the database. The information itself can be stored in several different ways - before the use of digital computers, card files, printed books and other methods. Most of the data are stored on computer files. A database system is a computer program for the management of electronic databases. A very simple example of a database system would be an electronic address book. Database data are organized in some way. Before there were computers, employees' data were often stored in file cabinets. There was usually a card for each employee. On the card, information such as the date of birth or the employee's name could be found. A database also has such ""cards""."
"Databending (or bending of data) is the process of manipulating a media file of a given format, using software designed to modify files of another format. The distortion in the media usually occurs accordingly, and the process either falls within a broader category of, or is frequently used in glit art. The term databending is derived from the bending of circuits, in which objects such as children's toys, effects pedals and electronic keyboards are deliberately short-circuited in bending of the circuit to produce erratic and spontaneous sounds. As the bending of circuits, databending involves the (often unpredictable) alteration of the behavior of its target. Databending makes this modification by manipulating information in a multimedia file of a given format, using software designed to modify files of a different format; the distortion in the media usually occurs accordingly. Many techniques exist, including the use of hex editors to manipulate certain components of a compression algorithm."
"The global warming of the Earth reduces snow and ice. The warming of the polar seas causes the surface of the sea to freeze less in winter and glaciers to retreat, generating more free and ice-free water. Less sea ice provides a longer growing season for marine plants called microalgae (phytoplankton) and removes more carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere. The growth of microalgae provides more food for animals that eat algae and store this carbon by the growth of their bodies. The carbon stored by marine life is called blue carbon. When marine animals die of blue carbon is buried in the seabed, and carbon is removed from the carbon cycle. This carbon capture in the seabed or elsewhere is called sequestration. The amount of polar blue carbon increases with global warming."
"Like herbivores and predators, decomposed species are heterotrophic, which means that they use organic substrates to obtain energy, carbon and nutrients for growth and development. Although decomposed and detritivated terms are often used interchangeably, detritivores must digest dead matter by internal processes, while decomposed species can break down cells from other organisms using biochemical reactions without internal digestion. Thus, invertebrates such as earthworms, wood chili and sea cucumbers are detrivores, not decomposed, in the technical sense, since they must ingest nutrients and cannot absorb them outside."
"An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is an autonomous defibrillator device designed to be mobile, easy and easy to use. It is often designed as a case to be worn by a handle. A DEA contains a battery, a control computer and electrodes. When the electrodes are glued to the patient, the control computer evaluates the patient, checks the rhythm of his heart. It will then charge at an appropriate level of power and will tell users that the person should be shocked. If the patient does not need to be defibrillated, the Automated External Defibrillator will not be able to administer a shock. A button must still be pushed manually to trigger the shock, as the operator must be certain that no one touches the patient. Often, the Automated External Defibrillators have speakers that give instructions when they are open. The current Automated External Defibrillator devices are designed for emergency medical technicians, home users, police and security officers and other persons with minimal medical knowledge."
"Density is a measure that compares the quantity, the ratio of matter an object has to its volume. An object with a lot of matter in a certain quantity of volume has a high density. An object with a little matter in the same quantity of volume has a low density. Temperature has an effect on the density. When the temperature of a substance increases, the density decreases because the atoms move around the place with less matter in a space. When the temperature of a substance decreases, the density increases because the atoms move more slowly so that the atoms remain in one place. Many substances follow this rule, but there are exceptions. Water is such an exception. When water freezes, it makes ice less dense than liquid water. Fresh water is often used as a standard of relative density."
"The diarchy (or dyarchy, i.e. the ""rule"") is a form of government in which two individuals (the ""diarchs"") are common heads of state. Most of the diarchs occupy their place for life, passing the position to their children or other members of the family. The diarchy is one of the oldest forms of government: the former Sparta, Rome, Carthage, as well as the Germanic and Dacian tribes. Several ancient Polynesian societies also have a diarchic political structure. The ranks of the Inca Empire were structured in several fractions, with two occupants of each rank, but with a different prestige, a Hanan (high) and a Hurin (inferior)."
"A diaspora (from the Greek, ""dispersal, dispersion"") is a dispersed population whose origin lies within a smaller geographical area. The diaspora can also refer to the movement of the population of its native homeland. The diaspora has come to refer in particular to historical mass dispersions of an involuntary nature, such as the expulsion of Jews from Judea, the escape of Greeks after the fall of Constantinople, the transatlantic slave trade, the South Chinese or Hindus from South Asia during the coolie trade, the Irish during and after the Irish famine, the displacement of Palestinians in the 20th century and the exile and deportation of Circassians. Recently, scholars have distinguished between different types of diasporas, due to its causes such as imperialism, commercial migration or labour migration, or by the type of social coherence within the diaspora community and its links with ancestral lands."
"A dictatorship is a country where a person or political party has the power to do what he wants. The leader is called a dictator. In a dictatorship, people generally do not have much rights or much freedom. Dictates come to power for a number of reasons or social problems such as massive unemployment, inflation and unrest among the population. Dictates are normally supported by powerful groups, such as landowners, owners of private enterprises, bank owners and, in some cases, institutions such as the Roman Catholic Church to establish law and order by force. This force is usually directed to the poorest parts of society, such as unemployed workers, ethnic minorities, working-class areas and slums."
"The research has shown that excellence at school has a lot to do with what is called executive functions. Executive functions are a set of capabilities that help you perform complex tasks, such as planning your school work, completing tasks, and controlling your emotions and frustrations. One of the most important executive functions is called work memory. Working memory allows you to keep information in mind and perform mental operations, for example, by adding a large number of tasks in your mind. Another important executive function is inhibition, which helps you resist distractions and temptations, for example, the temptation to eat the whole pot of cookies."
"Digital data, in information theory and information systems, are discrete and discontinuous representations of information or works, as opposed to continuous or analog signals that behave continuously, or represent information using a continuous function. Although digital representations are subject to discrete mathematics, the information represented may be discreet, such as numbers and letters, or be continuous, such as sounds, images and other measurements. The digital word comes from the same source as the words digit and digitus (the Latin word for finger), as the fingers are often used for discrete counting."
"The Digital Video Interface (DVI) is a standard video interface. It is used to send videos between a source (such as a personal computer) and a screen (such as a monitor). This interface cannot be used to transmit audio unless it is connected to a High Definition Multimedia Interface Converter (HDMI). HDMI and DVI monitors use the same signaling protocol, called Transition-minimized differential signaling. The DVI standard is widely used in the personal computer industry. Many personal desktop computers and monitors can use it. Most personal desktop computers and liquid crystal screens (LCDs) sold in stores now have a DVI interface. Many other devices (such as projectors and TVs) can use DVI as part of HDMI. HDMI is another standard video interface."
"Diplomacy is the practice of conducting negotiations between representatives of States or groups, which implies influencing the decisions and conduct of foreign governments and officials through dialogue, negotiation and other non-violent means; it generally refers to international relations conducted by the intercession of professional diplomats on a wide range of current issues; diplomacy is the main instrument of foreign policy, which represents the broader objectives and strategies that guide a State's interaction with the rest of the world; treaties, agreements, international alliances and other manifestations of foreign policy are generally the result of diplomatic negotiations and processes; diplomats can also help shape a State's foreign policy in a consultative capacity; diplomacy has become increasingly professional since the beginning of the twentieth century; the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, ratified by most sovereign States of the world, provides a framework for diplomatic procedures, methods and conduct."
"Some songs last only a few minutes. Some songs can continue for half an hour. Whales can also sing the same song for hours. There are many kinds of whales. Blue whales and grey whales bear the name of colors. Humpback whales and bowhead whales bear the name after the shapes of their backs and heads. Umura whales and Bryde whales bear the name of people. Each type of whale has its own song. Just listen and you can say who sings! Each species has different communities. They live in different parts of the ocean. Each community has its own songs. A blue whale in the Indian Ocean will sing a different song from its cousin in the Pacific. Just like humans speak several languages where they come from. Humpback whales are excellent composers. They mix several notes together. When you listen carefully, you can say that every humpback song is composed of many notes."
"DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that contains the genetic code of the organisms. This includes animals, plants, protists, archeas and bacteria. DNA is in each cell of the body and tells the cells what proteins to make. Most of these proteins are enzymes. DNA is inherited by the children of their parents. That is why children share traits with their parents, such as skin, hair and eye colour. One person's DNA is a combination of the DNA of each of their parents. Part of the DNA of an organism is non-coding DNA sequences. They do not encode protein sequences. Some non-coding DNA is transcribed into non-coding RNA molecules, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNA."
"A domain name is an identification chain that defines an area of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific names and addresses. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol resource (IP), such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the website itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names were registered."
"All feudal states or monarchies were not or are not governed by dynasties; modern examples are the Vatican City State, the Principality of Andorra and the Hospitaller Sovereign Military Order of St John of Jerusalem, Rhodes and Malta. Throughout history, there were monarchs who did not belong to any dynasty; non-dynasty leaders include King Arioald of Lombards and Emperor Phocas of the Byzantine Empire. Subnational monarchies that govern dynasties do not have sovereign rights; two modern examples are the monarchies of Malaysia and the royal families of the United Arab Emirates."
"The Earth is one of the four rocky planets within the solar system. The other three are Mercury, Venus and Mars. The large mass of the Sun makes the Earth move around it, just as the mass of the Earth moves the Moon around it. The Earth also rotates around it in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times. The Earth rotates around the Sun once (a ""year"") for every 3651⁄4 times it revolves all around (a ""day""). The Moon revolves around the Earth every 27 days or so. As the Earth rotates around the Sun at the same time, the changing light of the Moon takes about 291⁄2 days to go from black to black. This is where the idea of ""months"" came. However, now, most months have 30 or 31 days so that they will fit into a year."
"An earthquake (also known as earthquake, earthquake or temblor) is the perceptible earthquake of the Earth's surface, resulting from the sudden release of energy into the earth's crust that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can be violent enough to throw people around and destroy entire cities. The seismicity or seismic activity of a region refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced during a given period. Earthquakes are measured using observations made from sismometers. The timing is the most common scale on which earthquakes larger than about 5 are reported for the entire globe."
"These biotic and abiotic elements are considered to be linked by nutrient cycles and energy flows. As ecosystems are defined by the network of interactions between organisms, and between organisms and their environment, they can be of any size, but generally include specific and limited spaces (although some scientists say that the entire planet is an ecosystem). Energy, water, nitrogen and soil minerals are other essential abiotic components of an ecosystem. Energy flowing through ecosystems is obtained mainly from the sun. It usually enters the system through photosynthesis, a process that also captures carbon from the atmosphere. By feeding on plants and on each other, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system. They also influence the amount of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon into the atmosphere and facilitate the nutrient cycle by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass into a form that can easily be used by plants and other microbes."
"Edaphology (from Greek, edaphos, ""soil"") is one of the two main divisions of soil science, the other being pedology. Edaphology is devoted to the influence of soil on living beings, especially plants. The term is also applied to the study of how soil affects human land use for plant growth as well as the overall use of land by man. The sub-fields of edaphology are agricultural soil sciences (known as agrology in some regions) and environmental soil sciences. (Pedology deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology and soil classification.) In Russia, edaphology is considered equivalent to pedology, but is recognized as having an applied meaning compatible with agrophysics and agrochemistry outside Russia."
"Even before you go home with your new friend, you will know a lot of useful things, like what he eats and how many times you need to clean his tank. Now, if you tried to adopt an octopus, things wouldn't be so easy. I mean, does he even have a mouth? Scientists have a similar problem. When we plan experiments using animals, we need to know a lot about them so that we can tell if our experiences affect them or not. Since scientists can't hope to learn everything about each animal, they have decided to study only a handful of them and use these well studied examples for their research. These well studied creatures are called model organisms and in this article you will learn about the smallest of them."
"In metals, the atomic lattice changes in size and shape when the forces are applied (energy is added to the system). When the forces are removed, the lattice returns to the original lower energy state. For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when the forces are applied. Hoode's law stipulates that the force necessary to deform elastic objects must be directly proportional to the deformation distance, regardless of the size of the distance. This is known as a perfect elasticity, in which an object will return to its original form, regardless of how strongly deformed it is. It is an ideal concept only; most materials that have elasticity in practice remain purely elastic to very small deformations, after which a plastic deformation (permanent) occurs."
"The electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles. The charges of free particles are multiples of the elemental charge e; we say that the electric charge is quantified. Michael Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the discreet nature of the electric charge. The experience of Robert Millikan's oil drop demonstrated this directly, and measured the elemental charge. It was discovered that a type of particles, quarks, have fractional charges either -1/3 or +2/3, but it is believed that they always occur in multiples of integral charge; free quarks have never been observed. By convention, the charge of an electron is negative, -e, while that of a proton is positive, +e. The charged particles whose charges have the same sign repulse, and particles whose charges have different signs attract."
"An electric cable consists of two or more wires running side by side and glued, twisted or braided together to form a single assembly, the ends of which can be connected to two devices, allowing the transfer of electrical signals from one device to the other. The cables are used for a wide range of uses, and each one must be adapted for this purpose. The cables are used intensively in electronic devices for power and signal circuits. Long-distance communication is done on submarine cables. The electric cables are used for the bulk transmission of alternating and direct current power, in particular by means of high voltage cables. The electric cables are widely used in construction wiring for lighting, power and control circuits permanently installed in buildings."
"The electronic nose has been developed to mimic the human olfaction which functions as a non-separative mechanism: i.e. an odour/flavour is perceived as a global fingerprint. Essentially, the instrument consists of the sampling of the headspace, the network of sensors and the pattern recognition modules, to generate a signal scheme that is used to characterize the odours. The electronic noses consist of three main parts: a sample delivery system, a detection system, a computer system. The sample delivery system allows the generation of the headspace (volatile components) of a sample, which is the fraction analyzed. The system then injects this headspace into the electronic nose detection system. The sample delivery system is essential to ensure constant operating conditions. The detection system, consisting of a set of sensors, is the ""reactive"" part of the instrument. When in contact with volatile compounds, the sensors react, which means that they undergo a change in electrical properties."
"An electrostatic generator, or electrostatic machine, is an electromechanical generator that produces static electricity, or electricity with high voltage and low continuous current. The knowledge of static electricity goes back to the first civilizations, but for millennia it simply remained an interesting and mystifying phenomenon, without a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. By the end of the 17th century, the researchers had developed practical ways to produce electricity by friction, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin seriously until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies on the new science of electricity. Electrostatic generators operate using (or other) power to transform mechanical work into electric energy."
"The fleshy fruits have a high water content in the pericarp, and a fleshy mesocarp once mature, which means that fleshy fruits are more juicy than dried fruits. The group of fleshy fruits includes a lot of fruits that you can find in the grocery store, and many sweet fruits, such as peaches and apples. Pomegranates, although we eat the seeds and not the fruits, also fall under this category, because their pericarp is sweet and fleshy. Avocados, peaches, plums and other fruits with pits are also fleshy fruits, because they have a thick and fleshy mesocarp. Peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes are also examples of fleshy fruits, even if they are generally called vegetables. In fact, most edible fruits fall into the category of fleshy fruits. These fruits use animals, such as birds or humans, to disperse seeds."
"When an animal dies, its body changes its appearance. It will gradually disappear when it is eaten by other animals and bacteria. This process is called decomposition. When a sea turtle dies, the first thing that happens is that the body of the turtle, known as a carcass, flows to the bottom of the sea. However, the bacteria in its intestines continue to live and produce gas, gradually swelling the body. As a balloon filled with air, the body floats and rises to the surface of the sea. But, as the bacteria continue to break down the body, the carcass will eventually develop holes and leave the gases that kept it on the surface. It flows again and disappears permanently at the bottom of the sea. The turtles found stranded on the beaches of Virginia have arrived floating. They had not yet released the gases they contained, otherwise they would have sank and remained at the bottom of the sea without reaching the beach."
"On 22 Sept. 1862 Lincoln declared that in 100 days he would free all slaves in areas not then under Union control. On 1 Jan. 1863 he named the ten states in which the proclamation would then apply: Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Virginia, Kentucky and Louisiana. The five border states where slavery was still legal were exempted, and therefore not named, because they had remained loyal to the Union and were not in rebellion. Nor was Tennessee appointed because the Union forces had already regained control there. Several counties of Virginia that were separating from that state to form the new state of West Virginia were specifically designated as exemptions, as several parishes around New Orleans in Louisiana. The following paragraph is part of a quote from the Proclamation of Emancipation."
"As a newborn, you have spent more time sleeping than waking up. But the older you get, the less you sleep. It is not only the amount of sleep that changes during development, but above all, the balance between the different stages of sleep also changes. Generally, when you age, you sleep less and less slowly, while the proportion of light non-REM sleep increases. Scientists believe that these changes in sleep can tell us the potential of the brain to rebuild. From childhood to adolescence, your brain undergoes major reorganization and optimization to meet your daily needs."
"An emulator is a computer program or hardware that makes one type of computer behave like another, so it can use the same programs or do the same things as the other. They are the best to use old software and games on newer computers. They can be hardware that you add to the computer, or software that you use on it. Some types of emulators require newer computers that have the right system requirements. For example, you need a processor that is fast enough to meet the requirements of the emulator. Memory (both RAM and hard disk space) can be another factor to help it operate smoothly and with more precision."
"The environment is living things and what is around them. It includes physical, chemical and other forces. Living things do not exist simply in their environment. They interact constantly with them. Organisms change in response to conditions in their environment. In the environment, there are interactions between plants, animals, soil, water, temperature, light and other living and non-living things. The word 'environment' is used to talk about a lot of things. People in different areas of knowledge (such as history, geography or biology) use the word differently. An electromagnetic environment is radio waves and other radiation and magnetic fields. The galactic environment refers to conditions between stars. In psychology and medicine a person's environment is people, physical things, places and events with which the person lives. The environment affects the person's growth and development. It affects the person's behaviour. It affects the person's body, mind and heart."
"Environmental science is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates the physical, biological and information sciences (including ecology, biology, physics, chemistry, zoology, mineralogy, oceanology, limnology, soil science, geology, atmospheric sciences and geodesy) into the study of the environment and the solution of environmental problems. Environmental sciences are derived from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment. Today, they offer an integrated, quantitative and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems."
"Renewable energy is energy that can be easily reconstituted. For years, we have been using sources such as wood, sun, water, etc. to produce energy. Energy that can be produced by natural objects such as sun, wind, etc. is considered renewable. Technologies that have been used include wind energy, hydropower, solar energy, geothermal energy and biomass/bioenergy. Water purification: the whole idea/concept of having dirt/germ/pollution of the free water circulating in the environment. Many other phenomena result from this concept of water purification. Water pollution is the main enemy of this concept, and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water. Air purification: Basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove CO2 and convert it to oxygen."
"There are thousands of different enzymes and each one is specific to the reaction it catalyses. Enzymes have names that show what they do. Enzyme names usually end in –ase to show that they are enzymes. Examples of these include ATP synthase. It makes a chemical called ATP. Another example is DNA polymerase. It reads an intact strand of DNA and uses it as a model to make a new strand. An example of an enzyme is amylase, found in saliva. It breaks down starch molecules into smaller molecules of glucose and maltose. Another type of enzyme is lipase. It breaks down fats into smaller molecules, fatty acids and glycerol. Proteases are an entire class of enzymes. They break down other enzymes and proteins into amino acids. Nucleases are enzymes that cut DNA or RNA, often in place in the molecule."
"In the cloning process, an egg is fertilized in the laboratory, and immediately after fertilization, the DNA is removed from the egg. The empty egg is then injected with the DNA of another mature cell, such as a skin or a blood cell. Even if the DNA comes from a mature cell, the egg environment will essentially reprogram the genetic material of the mature cell, so that it can create an embryo. If the egg continues to develop, it will develop into a clone of the person or animal from which the mature cell was taken. Human cloning is illegal, but in the early 1960s, the English researchers managed to clone frogs. Frogs have relatively large eggs, so they are easy to work. Researchers took a fertilized egg from a frog, removed the DNA and injected the egg with genetic material from another frog."
"The erosion of the water occurs when the water moves the pieces of rock or downhill from the ground. The waves also carry small pieces of matter. A wave can wash on the surface of the rock or the ground, then carry pieces of matter into the ocean or the lake. The size of the earth's materials that can be moved by the water depends on the speed at which the water moves. A fast flowing stream can carry large rocks while a slow stream can carry only very small things like clay. The canyons are among the most obvious features of erosion. When a river meets the sea, it throws the solids, sometimes making a river delta. Large tropical rivers such as Paraná, Indus, Brahmaputra, Gange, Zambezi, Mississippi and Amazonia carry huge amounts of sediment to the sea."
"The European Union (abbreviation: EU) is a confederation of 28 member countries in Europe, set up in 1957 as the European Economic Community (EEC). It has created a common economic area with laws at European level allowing people to move and trade in other EU countries almost the same as in their own countries. Nineteen of these countries also share the same kind of money: the euro. The Treaty of Lisbon is the most recent treaty that says how the Union is managed. Each Member State has signed to say that they all agree with what it says. Above all, it says what jobs (powers) the Union should do for members and what jobs they should do themselves. The members decide how the Union should act by voting for or against proposals. The EU's objective is to bring its Member States closer to respect for human rights and democracy."
"An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet that revolves around a star other than the Sun. As of 1988, and as of August 16, 2016, there were 3,501 exoplanets in 2,623 planetary systems and 592 confirmed multiple planetary systems. HARPS (since 2004) discovered a hundred exoplanets while the Kepler Space Telescope (since 2009) found more than two thousand. Kepler also detected a few thousand candidate planets, of which 11% can be false positives. On average, there is at least one planet per star, with a percentage having several planets. Approximately 1 star out of 5 Sun type has a planet of ""Earth"" size in the habitable area, with the nearest should be 12 light years away from the Earth. Assuming 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, which would be 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, increasing to 40 billion if planets orbiting the many red dwarfs are included."
"One of the main features of evolution is extinction. A species is extinct when no member of the species is still alive. All species disappear sooner or later. The end of a species can occur for many reasons. It can be caused by habitat loss or excessive hunting, or by a major extinction event. An example of an animal that is now extinct is the Dodo, excessive hunting. Another quite different way for a species to end up is by the splitting of species, known as cladogenesis. Probably, none of the species living today lived in the Cambrian period, but their ancestors were. Threatened species are those that can become extinct. A Kew Gardens report suggests that one fifth of the plant species could be extinct."
"You probably know a lot of animals whose males and females look very different. Male lions, for example, have beautiful manes, while lions do not. In birds, males tend to be beautifully coloured, while females are not simply – think of ducks, chickens, or peacocks. But do you know how to distinguish between spiders and women? Usually spider females are bigger, but only if they are well fed. Females can also be a different color than males of their species, but this is not true for all species. You can use another really safe thing to identify a male spider."
"Fermentation is also used to designate the bulk growth of microorganisms on a growing medium, often for the purpose of producing a specific chemical. French microbiologist Louis Pasteur is often recalled for his ideas on fermentation and its microbial causes. Fermentation science is known as zymology. Fermentation occurs when the electron transport chain is unusable (often due to the absence of a final electron receptor, such as oxygen) and becomes the main means of production of the ATP cell (energy). It transforms NADH and pyruvate produced into glycolysis to NAD+ and organic molecule (which varies according to the type of fermentation; see examples below). In the presence of O2, NADH and pyruvate are used to generate ATP into respiration. This is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone."
"Have you ever seen an image of a dinosaur and realized that there is a palm-like plant next to it? Perhaps you walked around your neighborhood and saw the same kind of plant there? Unbelievably, these ancient plants, called cycades, have been around for millions of years. A unique cycadian plant can live up to 2000 years! We believe that the secret of survival and long life of cycads lies within a very special structure called coralloid root, which has microbes living inside. We studied these coralloid roots and found a great diversity of bacterial species that live within them, more than anyone had ever imagined."
"Feudalism was a combination of legal and military customs in medieval Europe that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries. Widely defined, it was a way of structuring society around relations derived from the possession of the land in exchange for service or work. Although derived from the Latin word feodum or feodum (fief), then in use, the term feudalism and the system that it describes were not conceived as a formal political system by the people of the Middle Ages. In its classical definition, by François-Louis Ganshof (1944), feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations between the warrior nobility, turning around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. A broader definition of feudalism, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but those of the three realms of the kingdom: the nobility, the clergy and the peasantry bound by matorialism; this is sometimes called ""feudal society""."
"Under feudality, taxes were not paid with money; they were paid in goods and services; gifts and taxes were to be given to the lords by their vassals. At the time of the harvest, the vassals gave part of their harvest to the lords; the vassals crushed their grain in the attices of the nobles; they gave part of the grain to their lords; when the animals were killed for food, part of the meat was given to the lords; the lords promised to protect their vassals, peace and security; the manors were wholly possessed by the nobles; they were given from one generation to the next; the first-born son of the noble took all this when his father died; every manor had his own pastures, mill, pressor, church and village; a manor had to let many people live."
"A fire alarm is an electronic ringtone or a bell. The ringtone makes a loud sound at high height to alert people that there is a fire in the building. Ringtones can be programmed to ring different tones. Most of the fire alarm bells in Europe sound like a siren. The ringtone makes a continuous sound. Some companies that make fire alarms are Wheellock and Simplex. There are also Fulleon that are best known for their Roshni electronic ringtones. These ringtones are often used in Europe and they have 32 selectable user tones. Sometimes, old fire alarms are metal bells. Many fire alarm systems also have flashing lights."
"T. gondii is a single cell microbe of about 6 μm (micrometres, 1/1 000 of a millimetre) of size, which is ~550 times smaller than an apple seed (3.3 mm)! This organism is so small that it can only be seen with powerful lenses of a microscope. T. gondii survives and multiplies only when it infects a living cell, which is why it is classified as a parasite. Animals that parasites infect are called hosts and parasites often have complex life cycles that involve different forms of parasite and multiple hosts. Cats are one of the hosts of T. gondii, and they are the only host in which this parasite produces structures called oocysts. An oocyst is a structure with thick walls in which the parasite can survive for a long time outside a host."
"Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as the anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy from old photosynthesis. The resulting age of organisms and their fossil fuels is usually millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include oil, coal and natural gas. Other commonly used derivatives include kerosene and propane. Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon to hydrogen ratios such as methane, to liquids such as oil, to non-volatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, such as anthracite coal."
"The first known introductions of red marsh crayfish in new locations took place in the 1920s: 1924 in California and 1927 in the Hawaiian Islands in the United States, 1927 in Japan and 1929 in China. In the mid-1960s, a lot of crayfish was sent to Uganda and Kenya, and shortly thereafter to other African countries. These animals spread to Mexico and reached Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic in the 1970s and Brazil in the mid-1980s. Red marsh crayfish were legally introduced in Spain in 1973 and 1974, first in Louisiana and probably later in Africa or South-East Asia. Currently, this species is present in at least 40 countries around the world."
"The demand for an item (such as goods or services) refers to the pressure on the economic market of people trying to buy it. Buyers have a maximum price they are willing to pay and sellers have a minimum price they are willing to offer their product. The point at which the supply and demand curves correspond is the balance price of the goods and the quantity requested. Sellers who are willing to offer their goods at a price below the equilibrium price receive the difference as excess production. Buyers who are willing to pay for goods at a price higher than the equilibrium price receive the difference as excess consumption. The model is generally applied to wages in the labour market. The typical roles of the supplier and the consumer are reversed. Suppliers are individuals, who try to sell (supply) their work for the highest price. Consumers are companies, who try to buy (demand) the type of work they need at the lowest price."
"The French National Assembly even used the American Declaration of Independence as a model when drafting the Declaration of Human Rights and the Citizen in 1789. The American success in their revolution was perhaps the ""greatest impact"" on the beginning of the French Revolution. After the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, the French government was deeply indebted. It tried to restore its financial status through unpopular tax regimes, which were strongly regressive."
"Static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop the movement between two objects. Kinetic friction is when the friction force is not strong enough to stop any movement. Some facts about friction are: Friction can be considered as caused by bumps on two touching surfaces. These bumps are called asperted. As these two rough surfaces move against each other, they are stuck and prevent movement until the asperities are broken or slipped. Even the smoothest materials have these asperities. s the force pushing on an object increases, static friction also increases. However, if the force increases beyond the maximum static friction, it accelerates the object (starts to move). The thing will begin to accelerate as soon as the static friction is less strong than the force pushing on that object. After this point, the kinetic friction will affect the object."
"Frogs are frogs of the Anura order. There is not much difference between frogs and toads, and they are not classified separately. It is because the way of life of toads, with its dry and rough skin, is an adaptation to life in drier habitats. The shape of toads has evolved a number of times independently, an example of convergent evolution. Frogs can live on land and in fresh water. They cannot survive in salt water. Their development is by metamorphosis. They usually hatch as egg tadpoles, which are laid by a female frog. Eggs are called toads. Tadpoles have tails and gills. When they grow, they lose their tails and gills and grow four long legs. Adult frogs can jump with their legs. They have long tongues that they use to catch insects."
"The dome, horizontal or inclined, is filled with real-time (interactive) or pre-rendered (linear) computer animations, live capture images or composite environments. Although current technology emerged in the early 1990s, dome environments evolved from many influences, including immersive art and narration, with technological roots in dome architecture, planetariums, multi-projector film environments, flight simulation and virtual reality. The first approaches to moving dome imaging used both 35 mm and 70 mm wide-angle lenses, but the uneven expenditure and nature of film support prevented much progress; moreover, film formats such as Omnimax did not cover the two complete pi steradians of the dome surface, leaving a section of the blank dome (although, due to the seating arrangements, this part of the dome was not seen by most viewers)."
"Mushrooms are a kingdom distinct from animals and plants. Mushrooms have cells with nuclei. Their cell walls contain chitin, unlike the cell walls of plants, which contain cellulose. These differences and others show that the fungi form a single group of related organisms, called Eumycota or Eumycete. They share a common ancestor and are a monophyletic group. Their basic way of life is saprophytic: a fungus breaks down the dead organic matter around it and uses it as food. Mushrooms reproduce both sexually and asexually. Some mushrooms grow mushrooms: they are fruit bodies. Under the hat there are gills; the gills carry spores that disperse and can develop into new fungi. Otherwise, the fungi use sporangium to carry asexed spores by mitosis, or sexual spores by meiosis. Spores are haploid."
"The king's subjects complained bitterly about their new house. They could not bear the burning summers or the cold and wet winters. They could not bear the hot sand and the moaning wind. Fynbos and Rooibos were the king's advisers of confidence. One day, they approached their king. ""Everyone suffers under these difficult conditions. Can we move to a place where life will be easier?"" they asked. King Protea smiled at his advisers and spoke with a soft voice. ""You are faithful and I hear your concerns. However, this is our house. Together, we can overcome any difficulty,"" said the king. The sun was beating on the kingdom of the Cape Plains. The heat was implacable."
"At first, some scientists thought listening to music could be beneficial by listening to music. They showed that people's scores on IQ tests were improving when they listened to Mozart's classical music. This led people to believe that listening to music makes you smarter. But it was an excessive simplification and an overestimation of the results. Subsequent studies have shown that listening to music does not really make you smarter, but rather increases your level of fun and lowers your feelings of stress, which sometimes results in better concentration and test scores. This means that although music in your home or class would not automatically improve your performance, it might be useful to help you focus on a new task or in situations where increased attention and reduced stress are needed."
"To infect a host, parasites must first find it in their environment, and to do so, they develop what we call transmission strategies, or ways to find and infect a host. Sometimes, parasites can be transmitted when an infected host is consumed by a predator who just happens to be the next host for the parasite. Then, the parasite infects that host and the life cycle continues. On other occasions, more than just chance is involved, and parasites actively increase their chances of transmission in various ways. A common strategy is by influencing the host's behavior, to make contact with the host easier. For example, the parasite Gyrodactylus bullatarudis uses colored guppy fish as host, infecting its gills and changing the way in which the fish swim."
"A galaxy is a gravitationally linked system of stars, star remnants, interstellar gas, dust and black matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxies, literally ""dairy,"" a reference to the Milky Way. galaxies range in size from dwarfs with only a few billion stars to giants with a hundred trillion stars, each orbiting the centre of mass of its galaxy. galaxies are classified according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are supposed to have black holes in their active centres. The central black hole of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times larger than the Sun."
"A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA composed of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. Transmission of genes to the offspring of an organism is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic characters.Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (several different genes) as well as gene-environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as the blood type, the risk of specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that make up life.In July 2016, scientists reported the identification of a set of 355 genes from the last common universal ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth. Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population."
"In astronomy, the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or ptolemaic system) is a replaced description of the universe, where the Earth is at the centre of all celestial bodies. This model has served as the predominant cosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as ancient Greece, including the remarkable systems of Aristotle (see Aristotelian physics) and Ptolemy. Thus, they believed that the Sun, Moon, stars and naked-eyed planets revolved around the Earth. Two observations commonly made supported the idea that the Earth was the center of the Universe. Stars, sun and planets seem to revolve around the Earth every day, making the Earth the center of this system."
"Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and under its surface, as well as the processes that shaped this structure. It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of the rocks found in a given location, and also to describe the history of these rocks. By combining these tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole, and also to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides the main evidence for plate tectonics, evolutionary history of life, and past climates of the Earth. Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the structure and evolution of the Earth, including field work, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling."
"Streams are capable of mobilizing sediments and transporting them downstream, either as bedload, suspended load, or dissolved load. The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediments themselves and the discharge of the river. Streams are also able to erode into rocks and create new sediments, from their own beds and also by approaching the slopes of surrounding hills. In this way, streams are considered as the starting point for large-scale landscape change in non-glacial environments. Streams are key links to the connectivity of the different elements of the landscape."
"So, what happens exactly in the brain that causes faster reaction times for the images expected (extended) in the activity we have described above? In man, a powerful method used to examine what happens inside the brain is to record the electrical activity produced by the brain when it is active. Brain cells (neurons) send information between them using small electrical signals. These small electrical signals can flow through the tissues and through the skull and scalp, where they can be recorded using electrodes (small metal discs) attached to the scalp. The electrical devices called amplifiers stimulate small signals so that we can observe them more easily. This method is called electroencephalography (EEG) and the recorded signals are called electroencephalograms (EEG or EEG signals). The EEG signal is produced by the activity of thousands or millions of neurons in the brain, and contains many electrical signals from different brain regions at any particular time."
"Communications satellites and meteorological satellites often use these orbits, so satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to travel to follow them. Terrestrial antennas can be permanently pointed to a fixed position in the sky. It is cheaper and easier than having a satellite antenna that always moves to follow a satellite. Everyone remains above the equator at a fixed longitude (east or west distance). The idea of a geosynchronous satellite for communication was first published in 1928 (but not widely) by Herman Potocnik. The idea of a geostationary orbit became well known for the first time in a 1945 article entitled ""Extraterrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?"" by the British scientist Arthur C. Clarke, published in Wireless World magazine. The orbit, which Clarke described for the first time as a good for broadcasting and relay satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbite."
"If you dive into the Red Sea, you will see large coloured rocks surrounded by different types of fish. These amazing structures are not actually rocks – they are animals called corals and they build coral reefs. Yes, they are animals! These animals do not live alone, instead of living with small plant cells inside them and many other microbes, such as bacteria and viruses. Coral animals and their friends are in danger, because the temperature of the water increases and because humans throw their garbage into the oceans. Did you know that corals can be sick and have diseases, just like human beings? Many coral diseases have been described."
"A glacier is a persistent body of dense ice that constantly moves under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) for many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to the stresses induced by their weight, creating crevices, seracs and other distinctive features.They also abrade the rock and debris of their substrate to create terrestrial forms such as circuses and moraines. Glaciers form only on earth and are distinguished from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of water bodies.On Earth, 99% of glacial ice is found in vast ice sheets in polar regions, but glaciers can be found in mountain ranges on all continents, except Australia, and on some oceanic islands of high latitude."
"A GPS receiver shows where it is. It can also show how fast it is moving, what direction it is going, how high it is, and perhaps how fast it is going up or down. Many GPS receivers have information about places. GPS for cars have travel data such as road maps, hotels, restaurants and service stations. GPS for boats contain nautical charts of ports, marinas, shallow waters, rocks and waterways. Other GPS receivers are made for air navigation, hiking and hiking, bicycles, or many other activities. Most are in smartphones. Most GPS receivers can record where they have been, and help plan a trip."
"Current temperatures are 0.74 °C (1.33 °F) higher than 150 years ago. Many scientists say that in the next 100 to 200 years temperatures could be up to 6 degrees Celsius higher than before the effects of global warming were discovered. The root cause seems to be an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, as predicted by Svante Arrhenius a hundred years ago. When people use fossil fuels such as coal and oil, it adds carbon dioxide to the air. When people cut many trees (deforestation), this means that less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by plants. If the Earth's temperature becomes warmer, the sea level will also become higher."
"Globalization is the way that local or national means of doing things become global, that is, they are done together all over the world, that is, in the areas of economy or trade, technology, politics and culture. People feel different about globalization: some think it helps everyone while others think it hurts some people. It describes how countries and peoples of the world interact and integrate. Globalization has many sides and can be economic, political and/or cultural. Economic globalization is the way countries come together as a great global economy, which facilitates international trade."
"It is important because the cells in an organism use it as a source of energy. Transforming glucose into energy is called cellular respiration, which is done inside the cells of a living organism. Glucose is made by plants in a process called photosynthesis. It can also be done by animals in their liver or kidneys. Having the right amount of glucose available in a person's body is important. It can be measured with a simple blood test. People who do not have enough glucose have low levels of sugar in the blood. It is a health condition called hypoglycaemia. People with too much glucose have hyperglycaemia. They can have a health condition called diabetes. Its chemical formula is C6H12O6. This means that it has 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms linked together."
"Ulysses S. Grant's presidency in the United States has been tainted by many scandals, including on black Friday, corruption within the Department of the Interior and the Whiskey Ring. (The Crédit Mobilier scandal, although exposed during his term of office, is not considered a Grant scandal.) Although Grant was not directly involved in these scandals, his associations with people of a dubious character and his dependence on cronymism, nepotism and political favouritism have given rise to accusations of ""granism""."
"Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm that occur between the beginning of the eighteenth century and the end of the nineteenth century. Each of these ""great revivals"" has been characterized by generalized revivals led by Protestant evangelical ministers, a sharp increase in interest in religion, a deep sense of conviction and redemption on the part of the affected people, an increase in membership of the evangelical Church, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations. All revivals have resulted from a powerful preaching that has given listeners a sense of personal guilt and their need for salvation by Christ."
"The Great Depression was the great economic crisis that began after the collapse of the American stock markets in 1929. Prices on the Wall Street stock market fell sharply from October 24 to October 29, 1929. Many people lost their jobs. In 1932, 25-30% of people lost their jobs. They became homeless and poor. This ended the wealth of the 1920s. Many people think that the Great Depression began on Tuesday, October 29, but economists think that black Tuesday was just one of the causes. From 1929-1932, the depression worsened. Many suspect that the increase in taxes on American citizens and the increase in tariffs (taxes on countries trading with the United States) aggravated it. Economist Milton Friedman said that the Great Depression was aggravated because the Federal Reserve printed less money than usual."
"Census figures show that African-Americans increased from 52.2% of the population in 1920 to 45.3% of the population in 1950 in Mississippi, from 41.7% in 1920 to 39.9% of the population in 1950 in Georgia, from 38.9% in 1920 to 32.9% of the population in 1950 in Louisiana, and from 38.4% in 1920 to 32.0% of the population in 1950 in Alabama. According to the total population in each of the four states, only Georgia recorded a net decrease (-143 188) in its population in Africa in 1950 compared to 1920."
"The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks and dust. It was built to protect the north of the Chinese Empire from enemy attacks. It is the longest human structure ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 meters (30 feet) wide and 15 meters (50 feet) high. The anterior sections on the wall are made of compacted earth and stone. Later in the Ming dynasty, they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals. Nineteen walls were built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC. The most famous wall was built between 226-200 BC by the first Emperor of Imperial China, Qin Shai Hong."
"The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere (the air around the Earth) imprison infrared radiation, making the planet warmer, similar to how it heats a greenhouse. The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases; the most important greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane. When there are more greenhouse gases in the air, the air retains more heat. Therefore, more greenhouse gases cause global warming. The greenhouse effect is natural. It is important for life on Earth. Without a greenhouse effect, the average temperature of the Earth would be about -18 or -19 degrees Celsius (0 or 1 degree Fahrenheit)."
"A habitat consists of physical factors such as soil, moisture, temperature range and light intensity, as well as biotic factors such as food availability and the presence or absence of predators. Each organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions under which it will thrive, but some tolerate large variations while others are very specific to their needs. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it may be inside a stem, rotten logarithm, rock or moss mass, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, a part of the host body, such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host body."
"Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an organic compound composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. It is a white solid, synthetically made from dextrose sugar when it is in its purest form. It can also be used as a vitamin supplement or as a food preservative. Did your parents tell you to drink orange juice when you were ill? That's because orange juice has a high level of vitamin C and can keep us healthy or treat a cold. The human body is unable to produce vitamin C and so we have to get it through our food or by taking a multivitamin. Vitamin C allows the body to use carbohydrates, fats and proteins."
"A hard drive (HDD), hard drive or hard drive, is a data storage device for computers that uses magnetic storage to store data. The capacity of a hard drive is usually measured in gigabytes (GB), but the capacity of the hard drive can also be measured in terabytes when the capacity is more than 1000 gigabytes. A gigabyte is a thousand megabytes and a megabyte is a million bytes, which means that a gigabyte is a billion bytes. Some hard drives are so large that their capacity is measured in terabytes, (TB) where a terabyte is a thousand gigabytes (1TB = 1024GB). Over the years, there have been many types of disk interfaces, although all have used the same rotating recording technology on plateau."
"Heat transfer is the exchange of thermal energy between physical systems. The rate of heat transfer depends on the temperatures of the systems and the properties of the intermediate medium through which the heat is transferred. The three fundamental modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation. Heat transfer, the flow of energy in the form of heat, is a process by which a system changes its internal energy, therefore is of vital use in the applications of the first law of thermodynamics. Conduction is also called diffusion, not to be confused with the diffusion related to the mixture of the constituents of a fluid. The direction of heat transfer is from a high temperature region to another lower temperature region, and is governed by the second law of thermodynamics. Heat transfer changes the internal energy of the systems from where and to which the energy is transferred. Heat transfer will take place in a direction that increases the entropy of the collection of systems."
"For example, a zig-zag for water came to mean the letter ""n"", because the Egyptian word for water started with n. This same image became our letter ""M"" in the Latin alphabet, because the Semitic word for water started with m, and Semitic workers changed the symbols to adapt the sounds in their own language. Similarly, our Latin letter ""N"" came from the hieroglyph for snake as the word for ""snake"" started with n in Semitic. In Egyptian, this image had been for a sound like English ""J"" because of their word for snake. Some images came to represent ideas, and these are known as ideograms. The Egyptians used between 700 or 800 images, or glyphs. They were written from right to left and from top to bottom. They did not use punctuation."
"A high-speed camera is a camera capable of displaying images greater than 1/1,000 or images more than 250 images per second. It is used to record objects in rapid motion as one or more photographic images on a storage medium. After recording, images stored on the media can be replayed in slow motion. High-speed cameras used to record high-speed events, but today high-speed cameras are fully electronic using a charge coupling device (CCD) or an active CMOS pixel sensor, usually recording more than 1,000 images per second in DRAM and slowly playing images to study the scientific study movement of transient phenomena."
"Hippocrates (c. 460 – c. 370 B.C.) was a Greek doctor who is called the ""father of medicine."" He was the first person to write that people fell ill for scientific reasons. People believed that the disease was caused by angry gods. Hippocrates wrote about the treatment of the sick. His writings are still important for doctors today. He said a lot of ideas that doctors are still studying. One idea he wrote about is ""patient confidentiality."" This means that doctors can't tell anyone what their patients are telling them. Another idea is that the doctor can't do anything to kill a patient. Such ideas are part of medical ethics."
"A degree in undergraduate history is often used as a springboard for graduate studies in business or law. Many historians are employed in universities and other institutions for post-secondary education. Furthermore, it is normal for colleges and universities to require a doctoral degree for new full-time employment. A scholarly thesis, such as a doctorate, is now considered to be the basic qualification of a professional historian. However, some historians still obtain recognition based on published (academic) work and the awarding of scholarships by academic organizations such as the Royal Historical Society. Publication is increasingly required by small schools, so that graduate papers become journal articles and doctoral dissertations become published monographs."
"The history of writing was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the Middle Ages. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, that of the Church and that of their bosses, the dynastic history of local leaders. In the Middle Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles of recording events year by year, but this style tended to hinder the analysis of events and causes. An example of this type of writing is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was the work of several different writers: it was started during the reign of Alfred the Great at the end of the 9th century, but a copy was still updated in 1154. Some writers of the time built a more narrative form of history."
"History is the study of past events. People know what has happened in the past by looking at things of the past, including documents (such as books, newspapers and letters) and artifacts (such as pottery, tools and human or animal remains). Libraries, archives and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called historian. A person who studies prehistory and history through things left by ancient cultures is called archaeologist. A person who studies humanity and society is called anthropologist. The study of the sources and methods used to study and write history is called historiography. People can learn about the past by speaking to people who remember things that have happened in the past."
"Homo sapiens is the binomial nomenclature (also known as the scientific name) of the human species. Homo is the human race, which also includes the Neanderthals and many other extinct species of hominid; H. sapiens is the only surviving species of the genus Homo. Modern humans are sometimes called ""modern anatomical humans."" Homo sapiens considers itself to be the most influential species of the planet, but many species of life, mainly plants and protists, have had a much greater effect on the outside of the Earth and its air. The recent African origin of modern humans is the current model describing the origin and dispersion of modern anatomical humans. The hypothesis that humans have a unique origin was published in Charles Darwin's La descende de l'homme (1871)."
"We rarely think of the complicated ways that the brain, jaw, tongue, lips, lungs and vocal folds work together to produce speech. How could your life be different if you had difficulty saying your name? For people who stutter, speaking is not always easy. In this article, we will discuss what is stuttering, a communication disorder, or a way of speaking that affects a person's ability to harmoniously link sounds and words together, is and why it is an invisible condition. We will also describe ways to support people who stutter. Stuttering is a communication disorder that affects fluence, the ability to harmoniously link words and sounds together in speech, a person's speech, which means the ability to harmoniously link sounds and words together."
"Human-computer interaction (known as HCI) studies the design and use of computer technology, focusing on interfaces between people (users) and computers. Both HCI researchers observe how humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in a new way. Human-computer interaction is at the intersection of computer science, behavioral science, design, media studies and several other fields of study. The term was popularized by Stuart K. Card, Allen Newell and Thomas P. Moran in their 1983 book, The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, although the authors first used the term in 1980 and the first known use took place in 1975."
"Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the air. Water vapour is the gaseous state of the water and is invisible. Humidity indicates the probability of precipitation, dew or fog. Higher humidity reduces the efficiency of perspiration in the cooling of the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of skin moisture. This effect is calculated in a heat index table or in the humidex. The amount of water vapour required to obtain saturation increases as temperature increases. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapour required to achieve saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a piece of air decreases, it may eventually reach saturation point without adding or losing water mass. Differences in the amount of water vapour in a piece of air may be quite significant, for example; A piece of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic metre of air at -1°C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic metre of air at -12°C."
"The Hundred Years War was fought between France and England at the end of the Middle Ages. It lasted 116 years from 1337 to 1453. The war began because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without a son. Edward III of England believed that he had the right to become the new king of France by his mother. The French did not want a foreign king, so Philip VI of France said that he had to be king because by the Salic law women could not govern or transmit the right to govern to their sons. Both countries went to war because of this disagreement. At the beginning of the war, France was the strongest of the two countries. France had about 17 million people while England had only about 4 million people. France had an alliance with Scotland against England, and England was trying to join forces with parts of the Netherlands."
"Hydroelectricity is the electricity produced by the movement of water. It is usually made with dams that block a river to make a reservoir or collect water pumped there. When the water is ""leashed"", the enormous pressure behind the dam forces the pipes that lead to a turbine. This turns the turbine, which turns a generator that makes electricity. This use of renewable energy produces less pollution than steam engines. Some places like Norway and Quebec get most of their electricity in this way. The way in which electricity is produced does not harm the environment as much as fossil fuels like oil or coal do. Hydroelectricity is very powerful and safe and does not produce any waste. Hydroelectricity can be returned very quickly."
"Hydrogen is the true primordial substance, the first atom produced after big bang. All the chemical elements have been formed from hydrogen by the processes of nuclear fusion. Hydrogen shines purple when it is in the plasma state. In its pure form on Earth, hydrogen is usually a gas. Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a molecule of water. Hydrogen is important because it is the fuel that feeds the Sun and other stars. Hydrogen represents about 75% of the whole universe. The symbol of hydrogen on the periodic table of elements is H. Pure hydrogen is normally composed of two hydrogen atoms connected together. Scientists call these diatom molecules. Hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when it is mixed with most other elements. It has neither colour nor odour."
"In the calculation, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a reference to the data that the reader can follow directly by clicking, typing or crashing. A hyperlink indicates an entire document or a specific element in a document. Hypertext is a text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked is called anchor text. A software system that is used to view and create hypertext is a hypertext system, and to create a hyperlink is to a hyperlink (or simply to a link). A user following hyperlinks is supposed to navigate or navigate through the hypertext. The document containing a hyperlink is known as his or her source document. For example, in an online reference book such as Wikipedia, many words and terms in the text are linked to definitions of these terms. Hyperlinks are often used to set up reference mechanisms such as content tables, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, letters and glossaries."
"According to the World Health Organization, it is essential to maintain a certain distance (1-2 m) when talking to other people. It is also important to avoid overcrowded places, wash your hands with soap and water frequently, or use hand-held disinfectants that contain 70% alcohol. It is also very important to avoid touching our face and covering our mouth with our arms when coughing or sneezing. We can also be asked to wear face masks in public places. These procedures can help reduce the spread of the virus and help us ensure that hospitals are not overcrowded, so that all those who need medical assistance can get it. Worldwide, different treatments are tested in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, but it will take some time to identify which drugs are effective and safe."
"An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is an implantable device within the body, capable of performing cardioversion, defibrillation and (in modern versions) heart pacing. Therefore, the device is capable of correcting most life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. CDI is front-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Current devices can be programmed to detect abnormal heart rhythms and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia in addition to low energy and high energy shocks. ""ICD"" has been marked by the Boston scientific society, so the more generic terminology ""ICD"" is preferred."
"The incubator is a device that is used to regulate environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and turning for successful hatching of fertile eggs placed in a enclosure. It is often used for bacterial culture, artificial egg hatching or to provide appropriate conditions for a chemical or biological reaction. The incubator is registered for hatching birds and reptile eggs. It allows the foetus inside the egg to grow without the mother having to be present to ensure heat. Chicken eggs are registered for hatching after about 21 days, but other bird species can take more or less time. The incubator is also used to raise birds. The incubator should be able to set up the environment and the perfect condition for an egg to incubate because it regulates factors such as temperature, humidity and egg rotation if necessary, so that the egg is incubated properly because it plays the role of the chicken in its natural state."
"The industrial revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes, from about 1760 to 1840, then between 1820 and 1840. Textiles were the dominant industry of the industrial revolution in terms of employment, value of production and investment; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The industrial revolution began in Britain and most of the major technological innovations were British. The industrial revolution marks an important turning point in history; almost all aspects of daily life were influenced in a certain way. In particular, the average income and the population began to experience unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the industrial revolution was that the standard of living of the general population began to rise steadily for the first time in history, although others said that it was only beginning to improve significantly towards the end of the 19th and 20th centuries."
"In the 1970s and 1980s, some people gave a new specific meaning to ""information."" At the time, the first computer databases were built."
"People may not want their medical records to be disclosed to others because they are concerned that they may affect their insurance or employment. Or because they would not like others to be informed of any medical or psychological conditions or treatment that may affect them. The disclosure of medical data may also reveal other details about their personal life.There are three broad categories of privacy: informational (the degree of control over personal information), physical (the degree of physical inaccessibility to others) and psychological (the extent to which the physician respects cultural beliefs, inner thoughts, values, feelings and religious practices of patients and allows them to make personal decisions)."
"Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data or information. Information technology (IT) is generally used in the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. Information technology is considered a subset of information and communications technologies (ICTs). An information technology (IT) system is generally an information system, a communication system or, more specifically, a computer system – including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment – operated by a small group of users."
"The instant replay is a video reproduction of something that has happened recently and that has been shot and broadcast live. The instant replay, which has already been shown live, is replayed to allow viewers to review and analyze what had just happened. Some sports allow to reverse official calls after a play has been examined. Instant replay is most often used in sport, but it is also used in other areas of live television. While the first almost instant replay system was developed and used in Canada, the first instant replay was developed and deployed in the United States."
"Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are the protections granted to intellectual property creators and include trademarks, copyright, patents, industrial design rights and, in some jurisdictions, trade secrets. Artistic works, including music and literature, as well as discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols and designs, can all be protected as intellectual property. Although intellectual property law has evolved over the centuries, it was only in the nineteenth century that the term intellectual property began to be used, and not before the end of the twentieth century that it became common in the majority of the world. The Status of Monopolies (1624) and the British Statute of Anne (1710) are considered to be the origins of patent and copyright law, respectively, firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property."
"The Internet Protocol (IP) is the main communication protocol in the Internet protocol suite for the transmission of datagrams across the network borders. Its routing function allows work on the Internet and essentially establishes the Internet. IP has the task of providing packets from the source host to the destination host only according to the IP addresses in the packet headers. To this end, IP defines the packet structures that encapsulate the data to be supplied. It also defines the address methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information. Historically, IP was the unconnected datagram service in the original transmission control program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974; the other being the Connected Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often called TCP/IP. The first major version of IP, Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant Internet protocol."
"The main physical processes ""attributing"" (destructive or expulsion mechanisms) interplanetary dust particles are: radiation pressure expulsion, the Poynting-Robertson (PR) radiation trail, solar wind pressure (with significant electromagnetic effects), sublimation, mutual collisions and dynamic effects of planets (Backman, D., 1997). The lifetime of these dust particles is very short compared to the lifetime of the solar system. If grains are found around a star about 10 million years old, then the grains must come from fragments recently released from larger objects, i.e. they cannot be left from the protoplanetary disk (Backman, private communication)."
"The intolerable laws or coercive laws were names given by the American settlers to the laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774. The British Parliament passed these laws to punish the Massachusetts colony for the Boston Tea Party. One of the laws closed Boston Harbor until the settlers paid for the destruction of tea. Another law prohibited correspondence committees. Another law allowed Britain to house troops wherever it wanted, which was called the Act of cantonment. The Quebec Act gave the country of Ohio to Canada. These laws were so hard that the colonist called them intolerable acts. Other colonies offered their support to Massachusetts."
"With the help of a web browser interface, users can access data held in any database that the organization wishes to make available to users at any time and — subject to security provisions — anywhere in the company's workstations, by increasing the ability of employees to perform their work more quickly, with greater precision and with confidence that they have the appropriate information. The Intranet also allows organizations to distribute information to employees as needed; employees can link with information relevant to their convenience, rather than being distracted without discrimination by email. The Intranet can serve as powerful communication tools within an organization, vertical strategic initiatives that are global in scope throughout the organization. The type of information that can easily be shared is the purpose of the initiative and what the initiative aims to achieve, leading the initiative, the results achieved to date and to whom to talk for more information."
"An ion is an atom or molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a positive or negative net electrical charge. Ion can be created, by chemical or physical means, by ionization. In chemical terms, if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, it has a positive net charge and is known as a cation. If an atom gains electrons, it has a negative net charge and is known as an anion. Ion consisting of a single atom are atomic or monatomic ions; if they consist of two or more atoms, they are molecular or polyatomic."
"The Iron Curtain formed the imaginary boundary that separated Europe into two distinct zones from the end of the Second World War in 1945 until the end of the Cold War in 1991. The term symbolized the efforts of the Soviet Union to block itself and its satellite states from the areas open with the West and non-Soviet. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were linked or influenced by the Soviet Union. On both sides of the Iron Curtain, the States developed their own international economic and military alliances: the member countries of the Mutual Economic Assistance Council and the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union being the first State. The member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (commonly abbreviated to NATO) and the United States as the dominant power."
"The atoms of a chemical element can exist in different types. They are called isotopes. They have the same number of protons (and electrons), but different numbers of neutrons. Different isotopes of the same element have different masses. The mass is the word for how much substance (or matter) something a. Things with different masses have different weights. Because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, they do not all weigh the same mass. Different isotopes of the same element have the same atomic number. They have the same number of protons. The atomic number is determined by the number of protons. The isotopes have different mass numbers, however, because they have different numbers of neutrons. The term isotope, which means at the same place, comes from the fact that isotopes are at the same place on the periodic table."
"Bats use sound to map their environment. They emit sounds and their brain processes the echoes received. Using this meaning, which is called echolocation, bats succeed in one of the most difficult problems of robotics, the need to move around in an unknown environment and map it. Many studies have tried to explain how bats do this, and we decided to build the Robat, a robot that navigates the world and builds a map using sound. Robat has a speaker that produces sounds, and it has two microphones like ears, to receive echoes. Robat's ""brain"" is a computer that processes echoes, estimates the location of objects in the environment and stores a constantly updated map. Robat can avoid obstacles and even identify certain objects."
"In addition to costing money, each building also has an impact on the surrounding environment. These impacts are often negative. For example, the land on which your house was built has been cleaned of plants and trees. The removal of plants forces the animals who lived there to move, which is bad for the environment. The wood used to build the walls has been collected with material that works with fossil fuels and pollutes the air. When the roof is replaced, the old material is transported to a landfill. And if we do not take care of the air conditioning system properly, the fluids needed to operate it can be harmful to the air we breathe. Let's think even bigger than one component."
"These predators are fast and use their eyes to detect their food, which means that they are the most effective for hunting during the day and in sunny surface waters. However, the food source of zooplankton, tiny plants known as phytoplankton, is found only in surface waters. Thus, zooplankton faces a dilemma: if they remain in surface waters to feed, they risk being eaten. If they hide in the depths, they will be safer, but soon hungry. This is what we call a compromise: each option (to feed or hide) brings a gain, but also a cost. DVM is the smart solution of zooplankton to balance this compromise and have the best of both."
"To understand how each sensory input contributes to the experience of self-motion, it is useful to remove individual sensory inputs to see what is going on. For example, how the removal of vision, using a blindfold, for example, affects our ability to judge the distance we have travelled, our speed of movement or our direction of movement? It turns out that we can still do pretty well when a sense is missing! But if we want to know how each sensory input contributes when all the inputs are available, as is the case in most daily interactions, it becomes difficult to manipulate each input independently. Modern virtual reality (VR) technologies have made this challenge easier (in the experience of self-motion)."
"The concept was born of science fiction in the 1960s and became popular as technology became a reality. The most common use of jet pack was in extra-vehicular activities for astronauts. Despite decades of advances in technology, many obstacles remain in the use of jetpack in the army or as a means of personal transport, including the challenges of the Earth's atmosphere, the gravity of the Earth, the low energy density of available fuels, and the human body being not naturally adapted to the flight. To compensate for the limitations of the human body, the jet pack must take into account all flight factors such as lifting and stabilization."
"Despite the many advantages of using Agrobacterium to improve cultivated plants, some groups seek to prevent the use of genetic engineering, and even to try to inform the public about the approach. One of the most common misunderstandings about genetic engineering is the belief that changing the DNA of an organism is not natural and therefore false. However, Agrobacterium has modified the DNA of plants long before humans learn to do so. This shows us that changing DNA sequences is a natural process and part of the world around us. By using Agrobacterium to modify the DNA of plants, we are exploiting a natural process to develop cultivated plants that need less pesticides, are more nutritious and produce more food using less land."
"We all live in time. It changes with the seasons but there are other changes occurring over longer periods. This change in average time (and in other things as well) is called climate change. The air is made of different gases. One of them is carbon dioxide, or CO2. CO2 is naturally found in the air but is also put there by things that humans do every day. For example, CO2 is put in the air by bus engines. It can also be put there by power plants that produce electricity by burning things like coal. When CO2 goes into the air, it heats the air. This is called global warming."
"When people think of the Amazon rainforest, they often consider it as the lungs of the planet, eliminating carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and releasing oxygen for animals, including humans, to breathe. People also think of snakes, monkeys, spiders, orchids, and the incredible diversity of life hosted by the tropical forest. All this is important, but there is more than that. Tropical forest interacts with the atmosphere in several ways, which affect the local and global climate. Winds near the ocean surface bring moisture from the tropical Atlantic Ocean in the Amazon. Some of this humidity falls in the form of rain, some can quickly be returned to the atmosphere through the evaporation and liberation processes of leaves and soil."
"Scientists have discovered that learning math and processing multi-digit numbers are easier for children who speak a language with a clear number of words. However, the problem is that not all languages have clear numbers of words. What do the numbers of unclear words look like? Look at some of the words for 97. In Basque (a language spoken mainly in a region of northern Spain), they say ""laurogeita hamazpi"", meaning ""eighty-seven"" (80 + 17). In French, they say ""ninety-seven"" meaning ""ninety-seven"" (4 × 20 + 10 + 7). The way these numbers of words are constructed is really complicated. In Hindi (one of the most popular languages in India), there are a few numbers for which people use subtraction rather than adding to build the number of words. For example, for number 29, they say ""unatis"", meaning ""one before thirty"" (30-1)."
"Fossils are the remains preserved or traces of a living organism, plant or animal. They tell us what life on Earth was hundreds, thousands or even millions of years ago! It is the fossil of a creature called ammonite. Ammonias were creatures similar to squids that lived in the sea 400 million to 65 million years ago. Paleontologists and archaeologists are scientists who dig the soil to find fossils. When they dug in the Himalayas, they found many ammonias. But how did the fossils of marine creatures find themselves on the highest mountains in the world? To answer this question, we have to go back a hundred million years, when the Earth was quite different."
"Researchers can also use MRI to see how the brain is organized, depending on how different parts of the brain are connected. Because the brain changes so much in adolescence, its organization can be influenced by what we do, our experiences and the environments in which we live. The brain is a vast network — different regions of the brain communicate with each other as a person performs different functions or behaviours, such as thinking about other people or moving around the world. These models of brain communication can be studied using a slightly different technique, called functional MRI (FRM). This technique examines the amount of oxygen in the blood circulating throughout the brain as a measure of brain activity."
"Beyond its obvious importance in everyday life, it turns out that spatial thinking is also important for the good you do in school, especially for mathematics lessons. People who are good in space thinking tasks also get high scores in mathematical tests. The link between good spatial thinking and good mathematical performance exists in people of different ages. For example, research has shown that infants who are better at building blocks do better in counting and number testing."
"The Kingdom of Prussia (Königreich Preußen) was a German kingdom which formed the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force of the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the main state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. The kings of Prussia were of the House of Hohenzollern. Prussia was a great power since it became a kingdom, through its predecessor, Brandenburg-Prussia, which became a military power under Frederick William, known as the ""Grand Elector""."
"Unfortunately, like many other major crops, the cultivation of a large number of oil palms causes some problems! Historically, oil palms have often been cultivated in regions with many different species. Malaysian rainforests have more than 2,000 species of trees, Asian and pygmy elephants and Malaysian tapirs. Indonesian rainforests contain endangered animals such as Sumatran tigers and rhinos. Large areas of rainforests have been transformed into oil palm plantations. Oil palm plantations account for 0.5% of global deforestation. In areas where oil palms are cultivated, these crops can be responsible for up to 50% of deforestation."
"Many scientific studies have found that, after making a mistake, we respond more slowly to the next round. This could be because the brain is trying to give itself more time, to avoid making the same mistake again. The stronger the ERN is after a mistake, the slower the answer to the next round tends to be. Some people have a larger ERN than others. Does this mean that these people are more sensitive to errors and learn more about their mistakes? Some studies seem to support this idea. For example, Hirsh and Inzlicht found that a stronger ERN was associated with better academic performance. In their study, researchers measured brain activity of university students and found that students with a larger ERN also tended to have better grades."
"The Korean War was a war waged in Korea between the armies of North and South Korea. The war began at 4:30 a.m. on June 25, 1950. The fighting ceased on July 27, 1953. More than two million Koreans died, most of them in the north. Both sides blame each other for starting the war. The North, led by Communist Kim Il-Sung, was helped mainly by the People's Republic of China, and the USSR. There was medical support from Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Poland. Other support came from Mongolia and India. The South, led by nationalist Syngman Rhee, was assisted by many countries in the United Nations, and in particular by the United States. The war did not end but a ceasefire was put in place."
"On Monday morning, your friend Jordan goes up to you and says, ""I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100."" Being a good sport, you play along and guess 43. ""No, too low!"" Jordan says. ""Well, how about 82?"" you ask. ""Too high!"" Jordan answers. You keep guessing. 60 is too low. 76 is too high. 70 is too low. Feeling happy that you're getting closer, you ask, ""How about 75?"" ""Do you have it?"" Jordan answers, and you're triumphantly walking towards your first class of the day. But after class, you're going back to Jordan, who seems to have thought of ways to trap you: why stay on positive numbers? And if you also allow negative numbers? ""Now I'm thinking of a number between 100 and 100"", Jordan says slided. You decide to take the bait, and you quickly discover that it doesn't change the game much."
"Doctors treat more than 2 million Americans with BIT each year. The common causes of BIT are car accidents or strokes of the head. Some BITs are severe and some are lighter. All BITs can have serious effects, which include bleeding, swelling of the brain or tearing of brain connections. It is important for researchers to study BIT, so that they can find ways to help people with brain injury improve. For this common purpose, scientists from around the world are doing research on BIT. People with BIT often come to hospitals or clinics and some are part of the research studies. BIT researchers are also following athletes and members of the military service because their activities increase the risk of BIT. In this document, we are examining different types of BIT studies. We are also discussing groups helping scientists. We will also tell you how you could become a future BIT researcher!"
"The researchers found that adolescents who use cannabis did not do as well as their peers who did not use cannabis on tasks requiring attention, learning, memory and reaction time. This was true even if cannabis users stopped using cannabis for a month before the experiment. Teenagers who begin to use cannabis at a younger age (under 15 years) perform even worse on these tasks than those who begin to use cannabis at a older age. Thus, what happens in the brain to cause this decrease in performance? As mentioned above, the endocannabinoid system in the brain is still developing throughout adolescence. Although its role in the brain is not yet fully understood, we know that the endocannabinoid system reinforces important connections and weakens those little important in the brain areas that are critical for learning and memory."
"Lasers are used in medicine, especially in LASIK eye surgery, where the laser is used to repair the shape of the cornea. It is used in chemistry with spectroscopy to identify materials, to know what type of gas, solid or liquid something is done. Stronger lasers can be used to cut the metal. Lasers are used to measure the distance of the Moon from the Earth by reflecting reflectors left by Apollo missions. By measuring the time it takes for light to go to the Moon and come back again, we can find exactly how far away the Moon is."
"Polar cod is one of the most numerous species of fish in the north of the Barents Sea. The Barents Sea is part of the Arctic Ocean, which is the maritime area in northern Europe, Asia and America, with the North Pole in the centre. Sea ice covers the central parts of the Arctic Ocean year round. In the regions further south, sea ice melts in summer and freezes again in autumn. Further south, there is no sea ice at all. In recent decades, temperatures on earth have increased due to human activities."
"What happens in brain cells when we learn that two things (e.g., a new boy and his name) are going together? In an experiment, we asked human participants to learn how to link different elements together. As participants learned these links, we found that nerve cells in their brain also bind these elements. These nerve cells were found in a region of the brain called the hippocampus. In this article, we will first explain how it is possible to listen to nerve cells in the human brain. Then, we will show some examples of the responses of these nerve cells, and finally, how the cells can bind different elements together."
"Scientists believe that we share this planet with millions of other species! But how do we know what species are there and how can we follow them? Unfortunately, humans lead many species to extinction and disturb important natural ecosystems. It is now more important than ever that we understand what species are present in different places and what role they play in their ecosystems. With this knowledge, we can understand how to protect important organisms and their habitats."
"A LED light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity. LEDs last a long time and do not break easily (compared to incandescent bulbs). They can produce many different colors. They are effective - most of the energy makes light, not heat. A LED is a type of diode that makes a color of light when the electricity is sent through it in the expected direction (electrically biased in the forward direction). This effect is a kind of electroluminescence. The color of the light depends on the chemical composition of the semiconductor material used, and can be near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared. The color affects the amount of electricity used by the LED. A white LED has two or three LEDs inside, of different colors."
"The light year is a unit of length used to express the astronomical distances and measures approximately 9.46 trillion kilometres (9.46 x 1012 km) or 5.88 trillion miles (5.88 x 1012 mi). According to the definition of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in a Julian year (365.25 days).Because it understands the word ""year"", the light year can be misinterpreted as a unit of time. The light year is most often used to express distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale, especially in non-specialized and popular scientific publications. The most commonly used unit in professional astrometry is the parsec (symbol: pc, about 3.26 light years; the distance at which an astronomical unit subsidizes an angle of a second arc)."
"While contemplating these dark prospects, let us look at the bright side towards the sky. Every day, the sun sends a huge amount of energy. The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of our planet is so vast that in 1 year it is about twice as great as it will never be obtained from all the non-renewable resources of Earth of coal, oil, natural gas and uranium extracted (for nuclear energy) combined. The sun provides more energy in about an hour than the world uses in a year! Moreover, the sun is free and does not belong to any country. It is a local resource, inexhaustible that is clean and sustainable."
"In the 1980s, many people liked to use an operating system called Unix. But because it restricted the user to share and improve the system, some people made a new operating system that would work as Unix but anyone could share or improve. MINIX, similar to Unix, was used as a teaching tool for university students to learn how operating systems work. MINIX also restricted its sharing and improvement by its users. A group of people called the GNU project wrote different parts of a new operating system called G.N.U., but it did not have all the parts that an operating system has to work. In 1991 Linus Torvalds started working on a replacement for MINIX that would be free to use, and that would cost nothing. Linus started the project when he attended the University of Helsinki."
"Each pixel (block) of an LCD consists of a thin layer of molecules between two electrodes and two polarizing filters. The electrodes provide electrical energy to the liquid crystal layer, and do not block the light. The light moves with ""polarity"" or direction, and a polarizing filter only lets light pass with one kind of polarity, like trying to slip a ruler through a narrow opening. It is only when the rule is aligned to the right that it adapts. These two filters are perpendicular to each other, so that the narrow openings are in different directions."
"There are two types of lithosphere: the ocean lithosphere, which is associated with the ocean crust and which exists in ocean basins. The ocean lithosphere is usually about 50 to 100 km thick The continental lithosphere, which is associated with the continental crust. The continental lithosphere has a thickness of about 40 km to about 200 km, of which about 40 km is crust. The lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates, which move progressively in relation to the other. The ocean lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts the warm asthenospheric astheosphere into a lithospheric mantle, and makes the ocean lithosphere increasingly dense with age. The ocean lithosphere is less dense than the asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years, but after this becomes more dense than the asthenosphere."
"Teenagers have very important socio-emotional development goals – such as finding out who they are and developing relationships with others – that could be influenced by social media. Teenagers are inclined to pay a lot of attention to the number of people like others or to follow on social media because it is particularly important to be loved by peers and to feel popular and admired during this period. This need to get extrinsic rewards, especially positive feedback from friends, could be one of the reasons why the majority of teens are constantly using social media. Social media can be an excellent tool to connect with friends when they are used in a positive way (such as learning more about what a friend likes or giving them encouragement)."
"The National Sleep Foundation recommends that school-age children (aged 6-13) sleep between 9 and 11 a.m. per night. Teenagers should be between 8 and 10 a.m. at night and adults around 7 and 9 a.m. If you are a student, especially in the United States, it can be difficult to get that amount of sleep on the evening of school. As you go through puberty, your body wants to go to bed later and sleep later. But school (especially in the United States) often starts too early! It makes it difficult for teenagers to sleep enough on the evening of school."
"We found that if children were from an island or continent, they were the most important factor in predicting the groups of species they cared about most. Being from an island or continent predicted 26% of the species of children enrolled. Being a girl or boy also counted, but was much less important and only predicted 3% of the species of children who cared about it. As you can imagine, children cared much more about the great exciting animals, including sharks, birds, and mammals. The differences between the island and continental children were huge. Andros Island's children cared for fish, crabs, insects, flamingos, cats, dogs and pigs more than the children of North Carolina."
"Two patients (also musicians) who needed brain surgery wanted to ensure that the parts of their brains that allowed them to play music would not be affected by their surgical procedures. Patients were tested for language and music. By using ESM, we were able to examine whether the same brain areas played a role in both speaking and playing music, or whether there were distinct brain areas for each. To test the language, the two patients were asked to slowly count from 1 to 30 or until they were told to stop. They were also invited to repeat words. While speaking, the surgeon used ESM to stimulate small areas in colored areas of the brain to see if patients would make mistakes."
"In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as ""a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."" Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn and make predictions about data. These algorithms work by building a model from sample entries in order to make predictions or decisions based on data, :2 rather than following strictly static program instructions. Machine learning is closely linked (and often overlapping) to computational statistics; a discipline that also focuses on forecasting through the use of computers. It has close links with mathematical optimization, which provides methods, theories and fields of application to the field. Machine learning is used in a range of computer tasks where explicit algorithm design and programming is impossible."
"A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field. A daily example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also those that are strongly attracted by a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferromagnetic)."
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMR) or Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRT) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to image the anatomy and physiological processes of the body both in health and in disease. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, radio waves and field gradients to form images of the body. MRI is based on the science of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Some atomic nuclei can absorb and emit radiofrequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field."
"The blood is composed of red blood cells (bearing oxygen and nutrients to feed the body), water, hormones, proteins, salts, platelets and white blood cells (to defend against germs and diseases). The first doctors and scientists knew the blood vessels. An ancient Egyptian document called Ebers Papyrus, written 3400 years ago, talked about it. The blood system is much older than that however. It has probably evolved more than 600 million years ago. The heart pumpes blood into the blood vessels, which spread throughout the body. Blood travels through each part of your body to deposit oxygen, nutrients and white blood cells where they are needed and to collect carbon dioxide and other waste so that they can be eliminated. The heart even has its own blood vessels."
"In 1845, two doctors, Drs. John Bennett in Edinburgh and Rudolph Virchow in Berlin, had patients whose blood was ill. They did not know what the disease was – it was not in their books. They were the first to describe the symptoms of this new disease. It was a blood cancer that is now known as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the blood there are three types of cells: red blood cells (erythrocytes) carry oxygen to tissues and waste, such as carbon dioxide, in the lungs; white blood cells (leukocytes) help us defend ourselves against infections; platelets (thrombocytes) build a natural plaster to seal wounds. In patients with CML, the blood is full of cancer cells that occupy the entire space normally occupied by useful types of blood cells."
"Hormones such as testosterone and estradiol can attach to your brain cells. A brain cell seems different from cells in other parts of the body: it has a cell body, but it also has parts that look like glued wires. A brain cell often has a lot of shorter ""wires"", called dendrites to receive signals from other cells. These cells also have a longer ""wire"" called axon, which sends signals to other cells. There are two main ways that hormones can influence your brain cells. First, hormones can influence how the brain is organized, and these are changes that take time to occur."
"You can do this in different ways. Before you start a lesson, you can review what you've learned before on a certain topic (for example, fish laid eggs). Or, while studying, you can often pause and think about what you've just learned and how new knowledge is related to what you already know. This will help you use your media prefrontal cortex to integrate new information and better remember it for testing. Furthermore, such integration helps you build better schematics so that you can remember new related information even better in the future. Sometimes we can use memory ""tricks"" to connect new knowledge to our schematic knowledge. For example, when you learn a list of words, you can connect these words to places in your room or another familiar environment."
"Mars is the fourth planet of the Sun in the Solar System and the second smallest solid planet. Mars is rocky and cold, with polar ice caps of ice water and carbon dioxide. It has the largest volcano of the Solar System, and some very large impact craters. Mars is named after the mythical Roman god of war because it is a red planet, the color of blood. Mars has two small moons, called Phobos and Deimos. Mars planet is made of rock. The ground is red because of iron oxide (rust) in rocks and dust. The atmosphere of the planet is very thin and contains a lot of carbon dioxide and a very small amount of oxygen. Mars temperatures are colder than on Earth, because it is farther away from the Sun and has less air to keep the heat inside. There is water ice and carbon dioxide freezing at the north and south poles. Mars has no liquid water on the surface now, but signs of runoff on the surface have probably been caused by water."
"The Marshall Plan (officially called the European Recovery Programme) was a plan of the United States to rebuild Europe's allies after the Second World War. One of the main reasons for this plan was to stop communism. The plan was named after Secretary of State George Marshall, but the plan was drawn up by other people in the State Department. The plan ran for four years from April 1948. During this period, US$13 billion in economic and technical assistance was granted to assist the rehabilitation of European countries that had joined the European Economic Cooperation Organisation."
"However, there is a big problem for these herbivorous fish when they eat algae. It is not easy to digest! Algae, like all living beings, are composed of cells, each being specialized for a certain role. Algae cells hold complex chains, large of sugars, called polysaccharides (pronounced, ""pol-ee-sack-ah-ride""). Different algae have their own unique composition of these large chains of sugar in their cells. To get energy from algae, herbivorous fish need to break these large chains. Inside the intestines of fish are molecules known as enzymes (think them like molecular or chemical scissors) that can break these chains of sugar into small parts fish can absorb into their bodies. There are many different types of these enzymes, operating as different workers on a construction team. Each enzyme has a specific job in destroying different parts of the algae. However, not all fish have the right types of enzymes to break down the algae."
"It may be difficult to know when it is correct to return to normal activities after a concussion. You may want to go back to school quickly so as not to fall back or miss important tasks. You may want to go back to your favorite sports and time with friends. The problem is that it takes most people from a few weeks to a month to recover completely from a concussion. Research has shown that the gradual return to usual activities like school and sport is important for recovery. Too soon can make your recovery takes longer. Taking time allows you, teachers, and parents to learn more about what you need for successful recovery. Remember, every brain injury is different. If your symptoms after concussion are manageable, you might just need to take easily for a few weeks while you go back to school."
"Mercury is the smallest and most internal planet in the solar system. Its orbital period (about 88 days of the Earth) is less than any other planet in the solar system. From the Earth, it seems to move around its orbit in about 116 days. It has no known natural satellites. It is named after the Roman divinity Mercury, the messenger to the gods. Partly because it has almost no atmosphere to hold the heat, Mercury's surface temperature varies diurnally than any other planet in the solar system, ranging from 100 K (-173 °C; -280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) at daytime in some equatorial regions. The poles are constantly below 180 K (-93 °C; -136 °F). The axis of mercury has the smallest inclination of any planet in the solar system (about 1/30 degrees), and its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the solar system."
"Mesopotamia is a name for the region of the Tigri-Euphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, and the regions along the Turkish-Syrian borders and Iran-Iraq. Widely regarded as one of the cradles of civilization by the Western world, the Mesopotamia of the Bronze Age included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires, all originating in the territory of modern Iraq. In the Iron Age, it was controlled by the neo-Assirian and neo-Babylonian empires. Indigenous Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians and Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) at the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the Achaemenite Empire."
"These enzymatic catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures and respond to their environment. The term metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including digestion and the transport of substances in and between different cells, in which case all reactions within cells are called intermediate metabolism or intermediate metabolism. Metabolism is generally divided into two categories: catabolism, decomposition of organic matter, for example, by cellular respiration, and anabolism, formation of cell components such as proteins and nucleic acids."
"HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system and weakens a person's ability to fight infections. There are about 37 million people living with HIV, mainly in Africa. Nearly two million people living with HIV are under the age of 15. Most of these children and some older adolescents/young adults are born with HIV. Drugs can help people living with HIV to lead a normal life, but many young people find it hard to tell others that they have HIV."
"In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming observed the effects of penicillin on bacteria in his laboratory in London. It was the first step in the discovery of one of the most important pillars of today's medicine: antibiotics. It took many years to find a way to produce penicillin in large quantities, and large-scale production only started in 1945. However, until now, Fleming is considered the father of antibiotics, and without his discovery, we could not treat many infections caused by bacteria. This means that without antibiotics, even a small infected wound could become fatal."
"It contains an integrated processor, memory (a small amount of RAM, program memory or both), and programmable input/output devices, which are used to interact with chip-related things A microcontroller is different from a microprocessor that contains only one processor (the kind used in a personal computer).First published in 1971 by Intel, microcontrollers began to become popular in their early years.The extremely useful Intel 8008 microprocessor was then released, but it was still impractical due to the high cost of each chip. These first microcontrollers combined different types of computer memory on a unit. After people began to see how useful they were, microcontrollers were constantly being upgraded, people trying to find new ways to improve them."
"A microphone, sometimes called microphone or microphone (both pronunciation of the IPA), converts sound into an electric signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, video recorders, hearing aids, motion image production, live and recorded audio engineering, radio and television, and in computers to record voice. The sound passes through the air in the waves, and as mentioned above, the microphone transforms the sound wave into an electric wave. Different types of microphones will transform sound waves into electricity in different ways."
"At the centre of propagation, on a ridge of the mid-ocean, the depth of the seabed is approximately 2,600 metres (8,500 ft). On the ridge, the depth of the seabed (or the height of a location on a ridge of the mid-ocean above a base) is correlated with its age (age of the lithosphere where the depth is measured). The depth-age relationship can be modelled by cooling a lithosphere plate or a half-space of the mantle. A good approximation is that the depth of the seabed at a location on a ridge of the mid-ocean that extends proportionally to the square root of the age of the seabed. The general shape of the ridges results from the isostacy of Pratt: near the axis of the ridge there is a warm mantle and low density supporting the ocean crust."
"The Middle Ages is a period of European history. They began around the year 476 CE when the Western Roman Empire ended, and continued until about the time when Christopher Columbus discovered the New World in 1492. The ""Middle Ages"" are called this because it is the time between the fall of Imperial Rome and the beginning of early modern Europe. This period is also known as the medieval age, the age of darkness, or the age of faith (because of the rise of Christianity and Islam). When used narrowly, the term ""Age of Darkness"" refers only to a very early period, from 476 to 800 (when Charlemagne became king)."
"Biomarkers are a measure of a disease process, usually measured after a focal injury. A typical biomarker would be the level of your blood sugar as a means of monitoring diabetes. In TBI, the biomarkers we are interested in include tau proteins, acid foliar protein, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, neuron-specific enolase. All these proteins are part of the molecular structures that make up brain cells in humans and animal models, such as wood that holds the frame of a home. When someone goes through trauma or injury, these brain proteins break, causing damage to brain cells, breaking the frame of the brain. Let's focus on the example of tau proteins. In brain cells called neurons, tau proteins help to form the structure of long, thin arms of cells, called axons, that communicate with other neurons."
"The Milky Way is our original galaxy. It contains more than 200 billion stars, including our Sun. The Milky Way has a diameter of 100,000 light-years, and is a spiral galaxy barred. The discovery of the Milky Way goes back to the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus. The Milky Way has three main parts: a disk, in which resides the Solar System, a bubble in the heart, and a whole halo. This galaxy belongs to the Local Group of three large galaxies and more than 50 smaller galaxies. The Milky Way is one of the largest galaxies in the group, after the Galaxy of Andromeda. The nearest neighbour to the Milky Way is Canis Major Dwarf, which is about 25,000 light years away from the Earth. The Galaxy Andromeda moves towards the Milky Way Galaxy, and will meet it in about 3.75 billion years. Andromeda Galaxy moves with a speed of about 1,800 kilometers per minute."
"A mineral is a natural chemical compound. Most often, it is of crystalline and abiogenic origin. A mineral is different from a rock, which may be an aggregate of minerals or non-minerals and does not have a specific chemical composition, as a mineral does. The exact definition of a mineral is under consideration, especially with respect to the requirement that a valid species be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with respect to it having an ordered atomic structure. The study of minerals is called mineralogy. There are more than 5,300 known mineral species; more than 5,070 of them have been approved by the International Mineral Association (IMA). Silicate minerals make up more than 90% of the earth's crust. The diversity and abundance of mineral species is controlled by Earth's chemistry. Silicon and oxygen make up about 75% of the earth's crust, which is directly reflected in the predominance of silicate minerals."
"The Miranda warning, which may also be referred to as Miranda's rights, is a right to silence given by the United States police to suspects in custody (or during a police interrogation) before they are questioned in order to preserve the admissibility of their statements against them in criminal proceedings. The Miranda warning is part of a rule of preventive criminal procedure according to which the application of the law is necessary to protect a person in police custody and subjected to direct interrogation or to its functional equivalent of a violation of his right to the fifth amendment against forced self-incrimination. In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the Supreme Court held that the admission of a statement of criminalization motivated by an uninformed suspect of those rights violates the fifth amendment and the right to the sixth amendment, by incorporating those rights into State law."
"In cell biology, mitosis is part of the cell cycle in which the chromosomes of a cell nucleus are separated into two identical sets of chromosomes, and each group ends in its own nucleus. In general, mitosis (the nucleus division) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (in which DNA is reproduced) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing approximately equal parts of these cell components. mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic phase (M) of an animal cell cycle – the division of the mother cell into two girls cells, genetically identical to each other and their mother cell. The mitosis process is divided into steps corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the beginning of the other. These steps are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which have already duplicated, condensed and attached to the opposite side of each cell to the opposite."
"The first digital networks are also known as second generation technologies, or 2G. The most widely used digital network is GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication). It is mainly used in Europe and Asia, while the CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access) networks are mainly used in North America. The difference is in the communication protocol. Other countries such as Japan have different 2G protocols. Some 2G networks are still used. 3G networks are more common, and many locations have 4G. The radio waves used by mobile telephone networks are divided into different frequencies. The frequency is measured in Hz. Low frequencies can send the signal further. Higher frequencies provide better connections and voice communications are generally clearer. Four main frequencies are used worldwide: 850, 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz. Europe uses 900 and 1800 MHz and North America uses 850 and 1900 MHz. Today, there are mobile phones operating on two, three or four frequencies."
"Therefore, we can conclude that only those parts of the brain that have shown a huge difference between calculation and rest are important for calculation. fNIRS is a technique that allows the measurement of brain function, even in special groups, such as babies and children, and in real situations, such as class. These abilities make fNIRS very good for research. Neurosciences education uses techniques, such as fNIRS to study the brain and uses the results of brain studies to improve education in schools. Although most of the brain techniques commonly used are excellent for studies in adults, they have several limits when used in children, which is why we still do not know much how the brain changes as we grow from babies to adults. Fortunately, fNIRS allows us to monitor brain changes and learning in children."
"Molecular nanotechnology (MNT) is a technology based on the ability to construct structures with complex atomic specifications by means of mechanosynthesis, which differs from nanometric materials. According to Richard Feynman's vision of miniature plants using nanomachines to build complex products (including additional nanomachines), this advanced form of nanotechnology (or molecular manufacturing) would use position-controlled mechanosynthesis led by molecular machine systems. MNT would involve combining the physical principles demonstrated by biophysics, chemistry, other nanotechnologies and life's molecular machines with the principles of system engineering found in modern macrometric plants."
"Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry and biochemistry, the term molecule is often used less strictly, also applied to polyatomic ions. In the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle whatever its composition. According to this definition, noble gas atoms are considered to be molecules as in fact monoatomic molecules. A molecule can be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of a single chemical element, as with oxygen (O2); or it can be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, as with water (H2O)."
"The monsoon is traditionally defined as a seasonal reverse wind with corresponding changes in precipitation, but is now used to describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with asymmetric heating of the land and the sea. Usually, the term monsoon is used to refer to the rainy phase of a seasonal evolution, although technically there is also a dry phase. The term is sometimes poorly used for heavy local rains but in the short term, although these rains meet the definition of monsoon. The world's main monsoon systems include monsoons from West Africa and Asia-Australia. The inclusion of monsoons from North and South America with an incomplete reversal of the wind was discussed. The term was first used in English in British India (now India, Bangladesh and Pakistan) and neighbouring countries to designate the large seasonal winds blowing from Bengal Bay and the Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rains in the region."
"The Moon is the only permanent natural satellite of the Earth. It is one of the largest natural satellites of the Solar System, and the largest among the planetary satellites in relation to the size of the planet it orbits (its main satellite). It is the densest of those whose densities are known (after the Io satellite of Jupiter). The average distance of the Moon from the Earth is 384 400 km (238 900 m), or 1.28 second light. It is thought that the Moon was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after Earth. There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon was formed from debris left after a giant impact between the Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with the Earth, always showing the same face, with its close side marked by a dark volcanic maria that fills the spaces between the bright crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters."
"In physics, movement is a change in the position of an object relative to time. Movement is generally described in terms of movement, distance, speed, acceleration, time and speed. The movement of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and by measuring the change in the position of the body relative to that frame. If the position of a body does not change in relation to a given frame of reference, the body is said to be at rest, immobile, stationary or immobile, or to have a constant position (invariant in time). The movement of an object can only change if it is actuated by a force, as described. The momentum is a quantity that is used to measure the movement of an object. The momentum of an object is directly related to the mass and speed of the object, and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system (which is not affected by external forces) does not change over time, as described by the law of conservation of momentum."
"With the spread and development of the English language around the world, it has become an important means of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a second language (ESL) in classrooms has radically changed with the prevalence of technology, which facilitates the acquisition of language learning skills by students. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual and animation support. It also helps to create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is the development of their grammar, vocabulary and knowledge of pragmatics and genders."
"Nanotechnology has offered the possibility of providing drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles. Overall drug use and side effects can be significantly reduced by depositing the active agent in the morbid region only and at a dose no higher than necessary. Targeted drug delivery aims to reduce the side effects of drugs with a concomitant reduction in consumption and treatment costs. Drug delivery aims to maximize bioavailability in specific areas of the body and over a period of time, which can be achieved through molecular targeting by nanomotor devices. The advantage of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can potentially be implanted inside the body, the shorter the biochemical response times are much shorter. These devices are faster and more sensitive than the typical delivery of drugs. The effectiveness of drug delivery through nanomedicine is largely based on: (a) effective encapsulation of drugs, (b) successful delivery of drugs to the targeted area of the body, and (c) successful release of the drug."
"Nanotechnology is part of science and technology with respect to the control of matter at the atomic and molecular scale, i.e., things of about 100 nanometres or smaller. Nanotechnology includes the manufacture of products that use parts of this small size, such as electronic devices, catalysts, sensors, etc. To give you an idea of the size of what is small, there are more nanometres in inches than there are inches in 400 miles. To give an international idea of the size of what is small, there are as many nanometres in centimetres as there are centimetres in 100 kilometres. Nanotechnology brings together scientists and engineers from many different subjects, such as applied physics, material science, interface and colloidal science, device physics, chemistry, supramolecular chemistry (which refers to the field of chemistry that focuses on non-covalent bonding interactions of molecules), autoreplicating machines and robotics, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, biological engineering and biological engineering."
"Napoleon Bonaparte (in French: Napoleon of Buonaparte; in English: Napoleon I; in French: Napoleon I; in English: Napoleon I; in French: Napoleon I; in French: Napoleon I: Emperor of the French, from 1804 to 1814; then in 1815; in French: Napoleon Bonaparte; in French: Napoleon I: Emperor of the French, from 1804 to 1814; in French: Napoleon I: Emperor of the French, from 1814 to 1815. Napoleon dominated European and world affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in Napoleonic wars."
"Do you believe in the journey through time? Whenever we remember something from the past or imagine something that will happen in the future, we engage in the journey through mental time. Scientists have discovered that, whether we return mentally to the past or to the future, some of the same brain regions are activated. One of these regions is the hippocampus, a brain structure famous for its role in the construction of long-term memories. The damage to the hippocampus causes problems of memory, but it also affects the ability to imagine future experiences."
"A nation is a group of people who share the same culture, history, language or ethnicity. It can also be described as people living in the same country and government. The word nation comes from a word meaning ""birth"" or ""place of birth."" The adjective is national. Some nations are people with a particular belief, such as the Vatican City, or an ethnic group, such as Armenia. Others share an idea, such as democracy in the United States or communism in China. Some nations are controlled by a small minority that has all the power, such as Saudi Arabia, which holds the nation with the use of that power. Some of them can also be combined."
"There are a variety of formation mechanisms for the different types of nebulae. Some nebulae are formed from gases already in the interstellar medium while others are produced by stars. Examples of the old case are giant molecular clouds, the coldest and densest phase of interstellar gas, which can be formed by cooling and condensation of more diffuse gases. Examples of this latter case are planetary nebulae formed from the material poured by a star in the latter stages of its stellar evolution. Star formation regions are a class of emission nebulae associated with giant molecular clouds. These forms of molecular clouds collapse under its own weight, producing stars. Massive stars can form in the centre, and their ultraviolet radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths. The ionized hydrogen region surrounding the massive stars is known as a H II region while neutral hydrogen shells surrounding the H II region are known as the photodissociation region."
"You and your friends have already worked together on a difficult puzzle? If so, you have probably worked together to solve it. Your brain works the same way. Different brain regions work together to solve a problem. The last piece of our puzzle is to understand how these brain areas work together when you calculate. As you know now, the way you solve arithmetic problems changes as you age. Instead of mainly using procedural strategies to solve arithmetic problems, you start to use the recovery of facts more often. But this is not the only thing that changes. Scientists have found that during this process the way different brain areas work together changes as well. For example, while you are young, the frontal cortex has a very important role. It manages your work memory and attention, because the way you solve arithmetic problems involves several steps (procedural strategies)."
"After decades of research, language workers have discovered that people's brains react differently to different types of errors in a sentence. One way to study the brain's response to semantic errors is to use the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG measures the electrical activity that always occurs in each part of the brain. To measure this activity, scientists ask people to wear special caps that are covered with sensors called electrodes. The electrodes sit on the scalp and measure the electrical activity from neurons (brain cells) that are just below the electrodes. Scientists can then study how electrical activity changes according to what volunteers do. Scientists have recorded EEGs while volunteers read phrases with semantic anomalies. In their experiments, scientists have asked volunteers to read many sentences that contain semantic errors."
"The teeth are protected by the hardest material of the body, the enam. It's harder than the bones! Every person has tongue prints and prints that are a kind! The liver has the power to come back! Just a quarter of this organ is enough to go back to its original size. The liver filters the blood that goes from our digestive system to the rest of our body. The small intestine helps to digest the food we eat. If it was stretched, it would be 20 feet long. It's the size of an adult giraffe! KHARRRR! KHARRR! It's the sound we hear if we can't breathe easily during sleep. GRAUP! URRP! It's the sound of the stomach that returns the extra air that has been swallowed. It's also called a burber. There are small waves of electricity in the heart that make it beat. GRAUP! URRP! It's the sound of the stomach that returns the extra air that has been swallowed."
"On leaving the shop, Zethu saw an exquisite necklace. She wanted this necklace so much! But her mother couldn't afford the necklace. ""It's lovely, my angel. I would like to have money for you,"" said her mother. Zethu was disappointed. She decided to spare and buy the necklace herself. She put all her money in a piggy bank under her bed. ""I'll wear this necklace to my next degree,"" thought Zethu. Finally, she saved enough money to buy the necklace. Then Zethu remembered that very soon it was her mother's birthday. ""I spent all my money, what am I going to give her?"" she asked. Zethu was very excited the morning of her mother's birthday. ""Happy birthday, mom!"" she said, giving a gift to her mother. Her mother opened the gift and found the necklace that Zethu loved so much."
"A nomad (Greek: nomads; i.e. a pasture roaming, pastoral tribe) is a member of a community of people who live in different places, moving from one place to another. Among the different ways in which nomads relate to their environment, one can distinguish the hunter-gatherer, the pastoral nomad owner of the cattle, or the peripatetic ""modern"" nomad. In 1995, there were about 30 to 40 million nomads in the world. Hunting and gathering nomads, according to the wild plants available in season and game, is by far the oldest method of human subsistence."
"As the brain grows and learns, connections between different parts of the brain are created. Over time, these connections create networks. Networks are different parts of the brain that work together. Like a well-trained musical group, brain networks help us learn skills like reading. As we learn, brain cells (called neurons) connect to each other by reaching their tiny arms (called axials) or even developing new arms. Over time, many axials connect and build long highways, called white matter tracts. These highways allow information to travel from one part of the brain to another. Using MRI, scientists have learned that we can read because different parts of the brain become more active and communicate with each other as we learn."
"There was a boy named John. He was living with his grandparents in a village called Daveyton Village in the free state. John grew up. He took a walk in the village and saw a baby crying. He rushed there and called for help. The village community rushed to him and asked him what happened. John replied, ""I was taking a walk and I saw a baby crying."" The community asked him again and they said, ""Do you know this child?"" John replied, ""No I don't do it."" Then the community leader took a baby home. The next day, John was called to a community meeting of the unknown baby. John was asked to go to Faith the farmer and the settlers who lived near the river where the unknown baby was found. John accepted this brilliant and intelligent idea."
"The oceans (or marine biomes) cover 72% of our planet. The largest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. It covers 1/3 (a third) of the Earth's surface. The smallest ocean is the Arctic Ocean. Different water movements separate the Southern Ocean from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean. The Southern Ocean is also called the Antarctic Ocean, because it covers the region around Antarctica. Older maps may not use the names of the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean. The deepest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. The deepest point is the Trench Mariana, which is about 11,000 metres (36,200 feet) deep. The deep ocean is characterized by cold temperatures, high pressure and complete darkness. Some very unusual organisms live in this part of the ocean. They do not need the energy of the sun to survive, because they use chemicals from the depths of the Earth."
"Between 512 and 518, at the end of the Wei dynasty, the Chinese geographer, writer and politician Li Daoyuan introduced the process of refining oil in various lubricants in his famous book Commentaire sur la classice de l'eau. Crude oil was often distilled by Arab chemists, with clear descriptions in Arab manuals such as those of Muhammad ibn Zakariya Razi (854–925). The streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, coming from oil that became accessible from natural fields in the region. In the ninth century, oil fields were exploited in the region around modern Baku, Azerbaijan. These fields were described by the Arab geographer Abu al-Hasan 'Ali al-Mas'udi in the tenth century, and by Marco Polo in the thirteenth century, who described the production of these wells as hundreds of cargoes of ships."
"Microwaves are a type of low-energy radiation that is not related to the temperature of the object. Since all objects naturally radiate this energy, they can be detected passively by sensors on satellites, hence the term ""passive microwave."" Low-energy microwaves can give us some information about the composition of the object from which they come. The types of atoms in an object and how these atoms are arranged affect the energy they emit. For example, solid sea ice gives more microwave energy in relation to the ocean water around it. When satellite data detect this higher energy zone, it tells us that there is sea ice on the ocean. Clouds in the sky don't give much microwave energy, and it makes it easy to ""see"" clouds to find sea ice using satellite equipment capable of detecting passive microwaves."
"In addition, the availability of an open-source application of a standard can increase the adoption of this standard. It has also helped to strengthen the loyalty of developers, as developers feel empowered and have a sense of ownership of the final product. In addition, lower costs of marketing and logistics services are required for the OSS. It is a good tool to promote the image of a company, including its commercial products.The OSS development approach has helped to produce reliable, high-quality, fast and inexpensive software.Open-source development offers the potential for more flexible technology and faster innovation. It is said to be more reliable because it usually has thousands of independent programmers testing and correcting software bugs. Open source is not dependent on the company or author who originally created it. Even if the company fails, the code continues to exist and is developed by its users."
"An operating system (or OS) is the name of a group of computer programs, device drivers, kernels and other things that allow a user to work with a computer. It can be small (such as MenuetOS), or large (such as Microsoft Windows). Different operating systems can be used for different reasons. Some are used for everyday things as on a personal computer. Others are used for specialized work. An operating system has a lot of tasks. It is responsible for ensuring that all programs can use the processor, system memory, screens, input devices and other hardware. It also allows the user to have a quick, clean and safe interface so they can work on the computer. It also speaks to other computers or devices on a network."
"The writing of Oracle's bones was the form of Chinese characters used on oracle bones, animal bones or turtle plastrons used in pyromantic divination, at the end of the 2nd millennium B.C.E., and is the oldest known form of Chinese writing. The vast majority records the pyromantic divinations of the late Shang dynasty royal house at the capital of Yin (modern Anyang, Henan province); the dating of the Anyang examples of Oracle's os writing varies from c. 14th to 11th centuries B.C. to c. 1200 to 1050 B.C.E. Very few Oracle's os writings date from the beginning of the next Zhou dynasty, because the pyromacy fell from favor and divination with Milf's oil."
"An orbit is the path that an object takes in space when it revolves around a star, a planet or a moon. It can also be used as a verb. For example, ""The Earth revolves around the Sun."" The word ""revolves"" has the same meaning, but ""rots"" is the spin of the object. Many years ago, people thought that the Sun revolves around the earth. Every morning, the Sun ascended to the east and descended to the west. It just seemed to have a sense that it revolved around the earth. But now, thanks to people like Copernicus and Galileo Galilei, we know that the Sun is the center of the Solar System, and that the Earth revolves around it. Isaac Newton discovered that gravity controls the orbit of planets and moons. As a satellite is an object in space that rotates around another object, the Earth is a satellite of the sun, just like the Moon is a satellite of the Earth! The Sun has many satellites that revolve around it, like thousands of planets, and thousands of planets come from the Earth."
"One organism is any living thing. It is easy to recognize a living thing, but not so easy to define it. Animals and plants are organisms, of course. Organisms are a biotic part, or living part, of the environment. Rocks and the sun are part of the non-living environment. Organisms generally have five basic needs. They need air, water, nutrients (food), energy and a place of life. However, all living things do not need all of this at the same time. Many organisms do not need to have access to air at all. A small reflection is necessary on viruses. There is no agreement on whether they should be considered alive. They are made of proteins and nucleic acid, and they evolve, which is really important. However, they exist in two very different phases. One phase is dormant, not active. The other is within a living cell of another organism."
"Ostracism (Greek: ostrakismos) was a procedure under the Athenian democracy in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state of Athens for ten years. While some cases clearly expressed popular anger against the citizen, ostracism was often used in a preventive way. It was used as a way to neutralize someone thought to be a threat to the state or the potential tyrant. It was called a ""honourable exile"" by the learned P.J. Rhodes. The word ""ostracism"" continues to be used for various cases of social hunting. The name is derived from the ostraka (singular ostrakon), referring to pottery that were used as voting chips. Broken pottery, abundant and practically free, served as a kind of scrap paper (as opposed to papyrus, which was imported from Egypt as a high quality writing surface, and was therefore too expensive to be disposable)."
"The Ottoman Empire, also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, or simply Turkey, was an empire founded in 1299 by the Oghuz Turks under Osman I in the north-west of Anatolia. After the conquests in the Balkans by Murad I between 1362 and 1389, the Ottoman Sultanate was transformed into a transcontinental empire and claimer to the caliphate. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, at the height of its power under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was a multinational and multilingual empire that controlled much of South-Eastern Europe, Western Asia, Caucasus, North Africa and the Horn of Africa."
"The ozone layer is a high ozone layer in the Earth's atmospheric stratosphere, about 10 to 50 kilometres above the Earth's surface. The exact amount of ozone varies depending on the season and location. This layer absorbs between 93 and 99% of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. This radiation is dangerous for living organisms on Earth. Over the past 100 years, the ozone layer has been damaged by human-made chemicals, particularly CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), which have been used primarily in aerosols and refrigerants. CFCs are broken in the upper atmosphere when they react with ozone, causing ozone depletion. International leaders have recognized this and joined by banning the use of CFCs."
"A P wave is one of the two main types of elastic body waves, called seismic waves in seismology. P waves travel faster than other seismic waves and are therefore the first signal of an earthquake to arrive at any affected location or seismograph. P waves can be transmitted by gases, liquids or solids. The P wave name can be used for pressure waves (as it is formed by alternating compressions and rare fragments) or primary waves (as it is at high speed and is therefore the first wave to be recorded by a seismograph). Primary and secondary waves are body waves that move within the Earth. The movement and behaviour of type P and type S waves in the Earth are monitored to probe the inner structure of the Earth. The discontinuities of speed as a function of depth indicate changes in phase or composition."
"The Paleolithic (American spelling; British spelling: Paleolithic) Age, era or period is a prehistoric period of human history characterized by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Modes I and II of Graham Clark) and covers about 95% of human technological prehistory. It extends from the first known use of stone tools, probably by Homo habilis 2.6 million years ago, until the end of the Pleistocene about 10,000 B.C. The Paleolithic era is followed by the Mesolithic. The date of the Paleolithic–mesolithic boundary can vary from locality to several thousand years."
"The word papyrus also refers to a document written on papyrus leaves gathered side by side and wrapped in a roll, a primitive form of a book. The plural for such documents is papyri. Papyrus is first known for being used in ancient Egypt (at least as far as the first dynasty), as the plant of Cyperus papyrus was a wet sedge that was once abundant in southern Sudan with the Nile Delta of Egypt. Papyrus was also used throughout the Mediterranean region and in the kingdom of Kush. The ancient Egyptians used the papyrus as a writing material, as well as commonly used in the construction of other artifacts such as reeds, carpets, rope, sandals and baskets."
"Some rivers are peaceful in winter. Some rivers are small and timid in summer. Some rivers roar angry in monsoons. A river can be brown, grey, black, blue, green or several other shades. They change color depending on what is inside or around them. Sometimes they are the color of the rocks at the bottom of the river. Sometimes they correspond to the color of the sky. Rivers also change their stream. If a river is in a place in the past, it can be somewhere else in the future. Many rivers like Ganga are thousands of years old. They have seen humanity grow. People have always loved living and working near rivers. Rivers know how to take care of people. Some of our food comes from rivers and the water of rivers is used to grow most of the food. When food has made its way through the body, rivers again!"
"Patriotism means loyalty of the person to his own nation or to the leaders of the nation. A patriot is a person who is on the side of his own nation or of his leaders. Patriotism is different from nationalism. The nationalist believes that every ethnic group must have its own nation, so that nations must serve the people. In other words, in nationalism, the nation is only a tool to have freedom for an ethnic group, while in patriotism, the nation itself is the highest value. A patriot can also be faithful to imperialist or colonialist nations, while nationalism is opposed to imperialism or colonialism."
"Penicillin was discovered by Scottish scientist Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928, but was not produced in series until 1940. The antibiotic is naturally produced by Penicillium fungi. There is now a whole group of Penicillium-derived antibiotics, including penicillin G, penicillin procaine, penicillin benzathine and penicillin V. Penicillin is sometimes used to treat syphilis, amantillitis, meningitis, pneumonia and other diseases. It was first widely used during World War II. Penicillin was discovered when Fleming noticed a mould that prevented bacteria from growing in a petri dish. Australian scientist Howard Walter Florey made the penicillin mold in a drug."
"One day, when Kunle and his father went to the market, his father said, ""Should I not take Kunle to school?"" While his father was thinking of going to school, he saw a school and asked Kunle if he wanted to go to school. ""Yes!"" Kunle answered. Then, Kunle and his father went to buy the school uniforms. After purchasing the school uniforms, Kunle and his father returned home to prepare his school equipment for the next day. The next day, he prepared himself, ate his food and made his bag. When Kunle arrived at school, he appreciated the teachings and learned things such as reading, sports, mathematics, science, civic education and verbal reasoning."
"They are called Linux operating systems. There are more than 300 different Linux ""distributions"". Everyone has a different purpose. Ubuntu-Linux is the most used Linux because it is the easiest to use. A modern PC has a minimum set of parts to use. The ""base unit"" or ""Tower"" is the main part of the computer. A mouse and keyboard are used for the input. A monitor is required to view the output. In a laptop, these parts are all assembled. In the base unit or tower there are many electronic parts. The main parts are the motherboard, CPU, hard disk and memory. The CPU (central processing unit) follows the instructions in the operating system and application programs. Memory, or RAM (random access memory), is for moving information (or data) to and from the processor quickly. The hard disk holds programs and data while the computer is turned off."
"A long time ago, all the animals could talk. Mother Mosquito and baby Mosquito lived in a house. Mother Mosquito always left baby Mosquito at home when she went to get food. One day, after mom left the house, baby Mosquito decided to see what was going on outside. Later that day, Mother Mosquito came back and found that baby Mosquito had left. Mother Mosquito started to panic! She was worried and was going to look for baby Mosquito. Just then, baby Mosquito arrived, very excited."
"One of the great threats to corals is the rise of ocean temperature. Although corals have been around millions of years, they are fragile animals in a way, especially when it comes to temperature changes. Here is what happens: there are organisms called zooxanthellae (pronounced zoo-uh-zan-thel-ee), which are very small and live within most shallow water corals. These zooxanthellae can perform photosynthesis; in other words, they can transform sunlight into food. They are so effective in producing food from sunlight that they can feed themselves and feed corals as well."
"In many atomic models in physics, photons are particles that transmit light. In other words, light is transported in space by photons. Photon is an elemental particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics, each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy. Photons have a resting mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein's theory of relativity says that they have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon has its name, Einstein re-launched the proposition that light consists of separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles have become photons. A photon is usually given the symbol C (gamma). Photons are fundamental particles. Although they can be created and destroyed, their lifetime is infinite. In a vacuum, all photons move at the speed of light, c, which is 299,792,458 meters (approximately 300,000 kilometers) per second."
"Physics became a distinct field of study after the scientific revolution. Galileo's experiments helped to create classical physics. Although he did not invent the telescope, he used it when he looked into the night sky. He supported Copernicus' idea that the Earth was moving around the Sun (heliocentrism). He also studied gravity. Isaac Newton used Galileo's ideas to create his three laws of movement and his law of universal gravity. Together, these laws explained the movement of bodies that fall near the earth and the movement of the earth and planets around the sun."
"A pilgrim (from the Latin perigrinus) is a traveller (literally from afar) who goes to a holy place. It is usually a physical journey (often on foot) to a place of particular importance for the adherent of a particular religious system. In the spiritual literature of Christianity, the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage can refer to the experience of life in the world (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant of a state of misery to a state of beatitude. Pilgrims and pilgrimages are common in many religions, including the religions of ancient Egypt, Persia in the Mithraic era, India, China and Japan. Greek and Roman customs of consulting gods to local oracles, such as Dodona or Delphi, both in Greece, are widely known."
"The plague of Athens was an epidemic that devastated the city-state of Athens in ancient Greece during the second year of the Peloponnese War (430 B.C.) when an Athenian victory still seemed at hand. It is thought that it entered Athens by the Piraeus, the port of the city and the only source of food and supply. A large part of the eastern Mediterranean also saw the appearance of the disease, but with less impact. The plague returned twice as much, in 429 B.C. and in the winter of 427/426 B.C. Some 30 pathogens were suggested as a cause of the plague. Sparta and his allies, with the exception of Corinth, were almost exclusively terrestrial powers, capable of convoking great terrestrial armies that were almost unbeatable. Under the direction of Pericles, the Athenians pursued a policy of retreat in the walls of the city of Athens, relying on the Athenian maritime supremacy for the supply while the Acelthenian marine movements took part in the higher Athenian movements."
"Plankton are organisms that drift in the surface layers of the ocean. They live in the upper layer of the ocean, called the epipelagic zone. They are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents. The term is in contrast to nekton, which can control their movements. There are three groups: Phytoplankton: who live on the surface of the ocean and photosynthesis (use light to make sugars and other molecules). Eukaryotic algae: diatoms, cocolithophores, some dinoflagellates. Bacteria: cyanobacteria. Zooplankton: small protozoa or metazoa: Ctenophores; jellyfish; rotifers; foraminifers; small crustaceans and other animals."
"Plasma is a state of matter. The other three common states of matter are solids, liquids and gases, so that plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter. Plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so that some of its electrons leave its atoms. This is called ionization. It results in negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions. Unlike other states of matter, particles charged in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields (i.e. electromagnetic fields). If a plasma loses heat, the ions will transform into gas, emitting the energy that caused them to ionization. More than 99% of the matter in the visible universe is supposed to be plasma. When atoms in a gas are broken, the pieces are called electrons and ions."
"The childhood of the plebeians was very different from that of their patrician counterparts, as they were expected to enter the labour market at a much earlier age. Plebeians generally belonged to a lower socio-economic class than their patrician counterparts and therefore did not have as many servants. Consequently, plebeian children were responsible for the maintenance of the household and the care of their aging parents. Education was limited to what their parents would teach them, which consisted only of learning the very basics of writing, reading and mathematics."
"In geology, a pluton is a body of intrusive igneous rocks (called plutonic rocks) crystallized from magma slowly cooling under the Earth's surface. Plutons include batholiths, stocks, dikes, sills, lacoliths, lopolits and other igneous bodies. In practice, plutons generally refer to a distinctive mass of igneous rocks, usually several kilometres in size, with no tabular form such as dikes and sills. Batholiths are usually groups of plutons. Plutons generally include Denali, Cuillin, Cardinal Peak, Mount Kinabalu and Stone Mountain. The most common types of rocks in plutons are granite, granodiorite, tonalite, monzonite and quartz diorite."
"It was a Saturday night, when we looked at our family's favorite program, that we saw the latest news of a presidential briefing, that we all became curious and attentive. The President announced that there was a case of a Kenyan who proved to be positive of Covid-19, a respiratory disease that was first discovered in Wuhan, China. It is spreading rapidly around the world. He announced the closure of schools, churches and mosques, and every public gathering stopped with immediate effect. I became very sad with the news and decided to visit the library Monday, little I knew it was a public place where the disease can spread quickly and therefore it was also closed. I decided to go home and study there. The Ministry of Health said that there was not yet a vaccine and that scientists around the world were working around the clock to get the cure of Covid-19. The disease affects all ages, colors and races."
"The commission was evidence that the privateer was not a pirate. It usually limited the activity to a particular ship, and some officers, for a specified period of time. In general, owners or the captain would be required to post a performance bond. The commission also dictated the expected nationality of the vessels at potential prices under the terms of the war. At sea, the captain of the privateer was obliged to produce the commission to a potential priced master as proof of the legitimacy of their price claim. If the nationality of a prize was not the enemy of the sovereign commissionaire, the privateer could not claim the ship as a price. It would be an act of piracy. Under British law, under the Marine Offences Act of 1536, piracy was an act of treason, or search of a ship without a valid commission. At the end of the 17th century, the prosecution of corsairs loyal to the usurped king James II for piracy began to move the legal framework of piracy away from treason to property crime."
"Functional programming looks at programming as a function in mathematics. Procedural programs specify or describe sets of steps or changes in status. stack-based languages look at some of the program's memory as a stack of cards. There are very few things that can be done with a stack. An element of data can be put on top of the stack. This operation is usually called ""pussoir"". An element of data can be removed from the top of the stack. This is called ""pop"". You can look at the element at the top of the stack without removing it. This is called a ""pek"". If a program is written as ""pussoir 5; push 3; add; pop;"" it will put 5 on top of the stack, put 3 on top of the 5, add the first two values (3 + 5 = 8), replace the 3 and 5 by 8 and print the top."
"While a tariff can simultaneously protect the domestic industry and generate government revenues, revenue protection and maximization objectives suggest different tariff rates, which implies a compromise between the two objectives. A tariff is an added tax on goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that make the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the domestic product initially the most expensive. For example, if a piece of fabric costs $4 in Great Britain and $4 in the United States, the U.S. government should impose a tariff to increase the price of British fabric for the Americans. The underlying objective of a protection tariff is to protect the domestic industry from foreign competition."
"Proteins have different functions depending on their shape. They can be found in meat or muscle. They are used for growth and repair, as well as to strengthen bones. They help to make tissues and cells. They are present in animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and also in the human body. The muscles contain a lot of proteins. When proteins are digested, they are divided into amino acids. These amino acids can then be used to build new proteins. Proteins are an important part of foods such as milk, eggs, meat, fish, beans, spinach and nuts. There are four factors that determine what a protein is going to do. The first is the order of amino acids. There are 20 different types of amino acids. The second is the small twists in the chain. The third is how the whole structure is folded. The fourth is if it is made up of different subunits."
"Works in the public domain are those whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been confiscated or are inapplicable. For example, Shakespeare's and Beethoven's works, and most of the first silent films, are all now in the public domain by being created before the existence of copyright or by leaving the term copyright. Examples for works not covered by copyright that are therefore in the public domain are the formulas of neotonian physics, culinary recipes and all software before 1974. Examples for works actively devoted to the public domain by their authors are the implementations of cryptographic algorithm references, ImageJ of NIH, and the CIA World Factbook. This term is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case the use of the work is called ""licensed"" or ""authorized""."
"In Egypt, the kings and queens, called Pharaohs, were buried in huge square-bottom pyramids built in stone. They were built to serve as tombs for the Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some pyramids still stand today. The oldest artificial pyramid found is called Step pyramid. It is in the Necropolis of Giza in Saqqara, near Cairo, Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. The subsequent pyramids were built much larger. The largest was the Great Pyramid of Giza. It was near Cairo. It was the highest building in the world until the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by Pharaoh Khufu (= Cheops) of the ancient Egyptian kingdom."
"Low-frequency radio waves can be folded around the hills by diffraction, although repeater stations are often used to improve signal quality. Short-wave radio frequencies are also reflected from an electric layer of the upper atmosphere, called the ionosphere. Waves can bounce between the ionosphere and the earth to reach receivers that are not in the line of sight due to the curvature of the Earth's surface. They can reach far away, sometimes throughout the world."
"Radiosurgery was originally defined by Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell as ""a single high-dose fraction of radiation, stereotaxically directed towards an intracranial region of interest."" In stereotaxic radiosurgery (HRS), the term stereotaxic refers to a three-dimensional coordinate system that allows an exact correlation between a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images and the patient's actual target position. Technological improvements in medical imaging and computer science have led to increased clinical adoption of stereotaxic radiosurgery and have expanded its scope in recent years. Despite these improvements, the accuracy of location and accuracy implicit in the word ""sterotaxic"" remain of the utmost importance for radiosurgery interventions today."
"The canopy is like a huge green roof on the forest. The trees grow thin and straight, like pillars in search of the sun. They do not come out of branches until they are very large. Then they stretch like an umbrella in the sunlight. The trees are so close that very little light penetrates into the lower layers. Many types of monkeys, birds and insects live in the layer. Animals that call this house of diaper often never touch the ground throughout their lives. They find everything they need inside the canopy. Water can be accessed from tree balls, otherwise, leaves and epiphytes that grow in the canopy can provide this need. Animals eat leaves and fruits of trees, insects, or other animals."
"Realism is a word that can be used in different ways. It is used mainly in the arts to describe how writers, musicians, painters etc. thought at the end of the 19th century. These artists tried to show the world as it really is, instead of trying to escape from a fantasy world, what the Romantics had done. Realists wanted to give an exact description of Nature and how people lived in society. Realism in literature was a movement that started in Germany. The poet and writer Heinrich Heine tried in his books to accept the world as it was instead of trying to escape from it. Realists tried to find good things in society. Interest in realism led to a movement called Naturalism. This meant describing scenes in nature with precision. The novelist Emile Zola was a naturalist."
"Rebellion, uprising or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order. It refers to the open resistance against the orders of an established authority. The term comes from the Latin verb rebellõ, ""I renew the war"" (of the re- (""again"") + bellõ (""I wage war/I revolt""). The rebel is the individual who participates in the rebellion or in rebel activities, especially when he is armed. Thus, the term rebellion also refers to the whole of the rebels in a state of revolt. A rebellion stems from a feeling of indignation and disapproval of a situation and is then manifested by the refusal to submit or obey the authority responsible for this situation. The rebellion can be individual or collective, peaceful (civil disobedience, civil resistance and non-violent resistance) or violent (terrorism, sabotage and guerrilla warfare.) In political terms, rebellion and revolt are often distinguished by their different objectives."
"The city of Florence is really where the Renaissance began. At that time Italy was not a single country. It was many small states, all governed in different ways and all fought or made allies all the time. Rome was politically powerful because Rome had the pope, the person who controlled the Roman Catholic Church. Because of its great importance as a spiritual leader, most people and most cities did not want to talk to the pope, no matter what pope he was. Because a new pope was elected when the old man died, all those who were rich and powerful always hoped that it might be a member of their family. It was always a good idea to have several young people in the family trained as priests, just in case. It was also a good idea to be good friends with other rich families."
"A republic is a type of government that does not have a king, queen or other monarch and where the people are sovereign. This means that people can choose leaders to represent them and make laws. The word republic comes from the Latin words res publica, which means ""public thing."" However, in practice, some nominal republics are actually dictatorships, like the Russian Soviet Republic and the other republics of the USSR from 1922 before its dissolution in 1991. Country with a king or other monarch and free elections is called a constitutional monarchy. This includes the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth kingdoms. What makes a republic different is that the people do not need the permission of a king, or other superior power, to choose leaders and the type of government they want."
"The respiratory system (also called the respiratory apparatus, ventilator system) is a biological system composed of specific organs and structures used for the breathing process in an organism. The respiratory system is involved in the supply and exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between an organism and the environment. In air respiration vertebrates such as human beings, breathing takes place in the respiratory organs called lungs. The passage of air into the lungs to feed the body with oxygen is known as inhalation, and the passage of air out of the lungs to expel carbon dioxide is known as exhalation; this process is collectively called respiration or ventilation."
"The first thing we need to know to help save whales from extinction is the number of these whales and their location. You might think that it would be easy to count very large whales, but they can be difficult to find in the deep waters off. Scientists also want to know where whales can come together to be social, feed and reproduce, because these actions are very important for whale survival. Scientists also want to know if whales have enough food and if people change the oceans to make whale life more difficult. Sometimes scientists can't look for whales in person — it could be difficult, dangerous or just too far away."
"RNA is an acronym for ribonucleic acid, a nucleic acid. Many different types are now known. RNA is physically different from DNA: DNA contains two intercoilized strands, but RNA contains only one strand. RNA also contains different DNA bases. These bases are as follows: (A) Adenine (G) Guanine (C) Cytosine (U) Uracil Adenine often forms links with uracil, and guanine often forms links with cytosine. In this way, we say that adenine is complementary to uracil and guanine is complementary to cytosine. The first three bases are also found in DNA, but uracil replaces thymine as a complement to adenine. RNA also contains ribis rather than deoxyribose found in DNA."
"A landslide is a type of landslide caused by a rock rupture in which part of the fracture plane passes through intact rocks and material collapses in mass rather than in individual blocks. Although a landslide occurs when loose dirt or sediments fall on a slope, a landslide occurs only when solid rocks are carried down the slope. Rocks fall down, loosen other rocks on their path and destroy everything on their path. Rock slides or rapid-flowing debris slips behave in the same way as snow avalanches, and are often referred to as rock avalanches or debris avalanches. The term landslides refers to a variety of mass waste events (geologic slope failures) that include hollows, slips, falls and flows. The two main types of landslides are rotational slips and translation slips."
"The Rosetta Stone is a stone with carved writing in it. French soldiers found it in Egypt in 1799. It helped people to better understand the ancient Egyptian writing system called hieroglyphs. Its discovery led to the translation of ancient Egyptian writing. The stone is named after the city where it was found, Rosetta. Today, this city is called ""Rashid"". The stone is now in the British Museum in London. It had three writing pieces on it that said the same thing in three different languages. One was in an ancient Egyptian script called demotic, the local language of the people in Egypt at that time. The other two languages were hieroglyphic and ancient Greek. Historians could already read Greek."
"Afeefah is a white rhinoceros baby. The Rangers saved her from the bush. Her mother was killed by poachers. The rangers took Afeefah to a safe place. Afeefah's heart was broken. And, she was afraid that the poachers would go back and take her horn. Slowly, Afeefah made friends. She felt safe and played in the mud. She drank nutritive milk at the sanctuary. One day Afeefah asked her friend Aaminah, ""Why do they want our horns?"" Aaminah sniffed, ""They think our horns are magic!"" ""But our horns are not magic!"" Afeefah exclaimed. ""No, of course. The horns are the same as the hair and nails,"" said Aaminah. Afeefah and Aaminah are the last of their kind. White rhinoceros are almost extinctive. They almost all left our world."
"To be sure that a person is allergic to something, a doctor can perform simple tests. The most popular ones are the skin sting test and the IgE test. In the skin sting test, the doctor or nurse puts small amounts of different allergens right under your skin. If you are allergic, you will develop a red bump where the allergen has been placed. The doctor can tell how allergic you are by the size of the red bump. In the IgE test, the doctor will do some blood tests to see if you have a large amount of IgE in your bloodstream, or the IgE specific to some common allergens. If you have a positive allergy test, and you know what allergens you are allergic to, the best treatment is to avoid contact with these allergens. However, it is easier to avoid contact with certain allergens, such as peanuts or milk, than to avoid atmospheric allergens, such as dust or pollen."
"A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope that produces images of a sample by sweeping it with a focused electron beam. Electrons interact with the atoms of the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the topography and surface composition of the sample. The electron beam is usually swept in a raster scanning pattern, and the position of the beam is combined with the signal detected to produce an image. SEM can obtain a resolution greater than 1 nanometre. Specimens can be observed in a high vacuum, low vacuum, humid conditions (in the environmental SEM), and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures. The most common SEM mode is the detection of secondary electrons emitted by electron atoms excited by the electron beam. The number of secondary electrons that can be detected depends, among other things, on the angle at which the beam encounters the specimen's surface, i.e. on the topography of the samples."
"If someone is in the water, you can use a stick to pull the person to safety. Never enter the water to try to save someone. If you arrive in the water, you can also drown. If the person who needs help is too far away from you to reach with a stick, you can throw something that floats. Throw something that they can hold and use to stay above the water. You can throw a soccer ball or an empty five-litre plastic container. If someone needs to rescue water, ask a rescuer or an adult for help. Never go into the water to try to save someone yourself. You can also call the free national emergency number, 112, a cell phone or a fixed line. If someone is rescued from water and does not breathe, you should call 112 to get help."
"After a night of heavy rains, a group of friends went to school. They arrived at the river that they had to cross every day. ""Yes! It stopped raining, but look how full and fast the river is,"" said Siya. ""Oh no,"" moaned Linda. ""Do you think the teacher will be angry if we miss classes today?"" Linda remembered what Sea Rescue's instructor had taught them in water safety classes. ""Never cross a flooded river. Even if you can't go to school,"" said the instructor. Meanwhile, Lungi walked straight into the river! ""I know where the steps are!"" he shouted."
"Johnny is late to meet his friends to go fishing. When he arrives at the beach, he realizes that he forgot to bring his lifejacket. ""Don't worry,"" said Ben, the owner of the boat. ""Here's a spare part I'm still keeping on board."" Because he's been fishing for years, Johnny knows how to put a lifejacket. He closes both straps on his chest and the two straps between his legs.""Okay,"" he said, ""it's strong and I'm ready to go!"" On the ocean, they find a good place to fish and anchor. From nowhere, a huge wave suddenly rises above them.""Look! The wave is going to hit us!"" shouts one of the fishermen. The boat has turned upside down and the men are thrown into the water. ""Eeeehhhhhh!"" they scream as they are plunged into ice water."
"You probably like bees: they are cute and furry, and they pollinate our crops and wild flowers. In a world without bees, we would be hungry, and our campaign would be very boring. But what about wasps? Wasps picnic. They ruin your summer picnics. They nest in your house and make your parents angry. There is no reason to love wasps. At least, that's what most people think. Maybe that's what you learned at school, or by your family: see a wasp: swap a wasp! Scientists dispute what people think of wasps and this article explains why we have to think differently from these insects."
"The Seven Years' War was a world war between 1754 and 1763, the main conflict that took place during the seven years from 1756 to 1763. It involved all the major European powers of the time, with the exception of the Ottoman Empire, covering five continents, and affected Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India and the Philippines. The conflict divided Europe into two coalitions, led by Great Britain on the one hand and France on the other. For the first time, aimed at reducing the ever-increasing power of Great Britain and Prussia, France formed a large coalition that ended in failure, with Great Britain becoming the predominant power of the world, changing the European balance of power."
"Why do animals put their energy in the light? One of the reasons to emit light is that, in the ocean, light penetrates barely deeper than a few hundred meters. Below this, it is completely dark. During the night, even the surface of the ocean is dark, except for the weak glow of the moonlight, so that light is an excellent way for animals to communicate. But with whom do they communicate and with whom do they see these signals? For marine species, emitting light or looking for light in the dark helps them find partners or even something to eat. For example, the fisherman uses its luminous glow to attract small prey that will undoubtedly end up in his stomach. Of course, since prey do not want to be eaten, they can also use bioluminescence, but as a defense."
"The Silk Road derives its name from lucrative silk, developed for the first time in China and a major reason for the connection of commercial roads to a vast transcontinental network. It derives from the German term Seidenstraße (literally ""Silk Road"") and was popularized for the first time by Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1877, who made seven expeditions to China from 1868 to 1872. However, the term itself was used in decades before. The alternative translation ""Silk Road"" is also used occasionally. Although the term was invented in the 19th century, it did not obtain wide acceptance in the academic world or popularity among the public until the 20th century. The first book entitled The Silk Road was by the Swedish geographer Sven Hedin in 1938. The use of the term ""Silk Road"" is not without its critics."
"In a simulation, physicians and nurses use equipment and supplies to perform neonatal resuscitation on a doll that looks like a real baby, in a classroom that looks like a real delivery room. An instructor, like a coach, directs the simulation and allows everyone to know what they are doing right, and how they can improve. Training together during the simulation is the best way to prepare for real neonatal resuscitation. It is important that doctors and nurses often train so that they do not make mistakes. However, doctors and nurses are very busy caring for many patients, so they often do not have time to train as often as they should."
"Although the first models can perform basic tasks, such as calculations, translations and games, the smartwatches 2010 are well-functioning computers. Many mobile applications work with a mobile operating system. Some smartwatches work like portable media players, with FM radio and digital audio and video files played via a Bluetooth or USB headset. Some models, also known as ""watching phones"", have full mobile phone capacity, and can make or answer phone calls or text messages. Although the internal hardware varies, most have electronic visual display, either backlit LCD or OLED. Some use transfective or electronic paper, to consume less power. Most have a rechargeable battery and many have a touch screen. Peripheral devices can include digital cameras, thermometers, accelerometers, altimeters, barometers, compasses, GPS receivers, small loudspeakers and SD card (which are known as a computer storage device)."
"A blast furnace is a vertical structure that is fed with coke, iron ore and limestone. When the hot air is blown into the blast furnace, the coke burns and reduces the oxygen of the ore, producing bare iron and carbon dioxide. The limestone binds to any other bedrock. The hot-bottom iron is taped in liquid phase at the bottom. It is then worked out in steel. The limestone and the bedrock form a compound called slag. It can be used to make bricks, concrete or road surface. Previous methods include Bloomery. Aluminum is melted in electric furnaces called electric arc furnaces. The aluminum ore is poured on the bottom of the oven and the electric current is driven through the ore. The temperature increases so high that the oxygen separates, leaving the metal aluminum. Copper is poured on the bare flame that burns sulphur and other impurities, leaving raw copper. Electrolysis uses the electric current to separate copper in large pools, which contain water so-called electrolyte solution."
"We have all experienced an injury, a local injury to the skin, at some point in our lives. Most often, the wounds heal completely and the scab is the only sign of the injury. With the exception of initial pain and bleeding, we may not pay much attention to the process by which the repair of the injury or the possible complications that may occur. The healing process of the injury involves a well-coordinated series of steps involving many cells, tissues and chemicals in the body. The interruptions in the healing process of the injury, often caused by the presence of bacteria, result in major disruptions and delays in the repair of the injury."
"A social networking service (also a social networking site, SNS or social media) is an online platform that is used by people to build social networks or social relationships with others who share similar personal or professional interests, activities, background or real connections. The variety of stand-alone and integrated social networking services available online in the 2010s presents definition challenges, but there are some common features: 1) social networking services are Internet 2.0 applications, 2) user-generated content (UGC) such as text messages, digital photos and videos, is the lifeblood of SNS organizations, 3) users create site-specific user profiles or applications that are designed and maintained by the SNS organization, and 4) social networking services facilitate the development of online social networks by linking a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups."
"Society is the expression to describe human beings together (collective, the sum of their social networks and their networks of power). It does not refer to all that everyone thinks or does, but only to what everyone does – or refuses to do – in a fairly reliable way. Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society who are ready to help even the richest and strongest, a society is very concerned about its citizenship, rights, ethics and time limits. These are fundamental means of achieving equity."
"As Socrates did not write any of his teachings, the secondary sources provide the only information about his life and thought. The sometimes contradictory nature of these sources is known as the socratic problem, or the socratic question. Plato and Xenophon's dialogues provide the main source of information on Socrates' life and thought. These writings are the Sokratikoi logo, or socratic dialogues, which consist of reports of conversations apparently involving Socrates. As for the discovery of real life Socrates, the difficulty is that the ancient sources are mainly philosophical or dramatic texts, with the exception of Xenophon. There are no simple, contemporary stories with Socrates, which dealt with his time and his place."
"Computer software (often simply called software) is a set of related instructions and documentation that tells a computer what to do or how to do a task or that can mean all the software on a computer, including applications and operating system. Applications are programs that do something specific, such as a game or text processor. The operating system (Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, etc.) is a software that helps applications to work, and controls display and keyboard. Word software was used for the first time in the late 1960s to show the difference with computer hardware, which are parts of a machine that can be seen and affected. The software is the instructions that the computer follows."
"Software as a service (SaaS; pronounced /sæs/) is a model of software licensing and delivery in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as ""software on demand"". SaaS is generally accessible by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many commercial applications, including office and messaging software, payroll software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software, gamification, virtualization, accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), management information systems (MIS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), billing, human resources management (HRM), talent acquisition, content management (CM), anti-virus software and service office management."
"Software development is a process of writing and maintaining source code, but in a broader sense it includes everything that is involved between the design of the desired software until the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software development can include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, reengineering, maintenance, or any other activity that results in software products. The software can be developed for various purposes, the three most common being to meet the specific needs of a specific customer or company (the case with custom software), to meet a perceived need of a set of potential users (the case with commercial software and open source), or for personal use (for example, a scientist can write software to automate an ordinary task)."
"Solar sails (also referred to as light sails or photonic sails) are a form of propulsion of spacecraft using the radiation pressure exerted by the sun on large mirrors. A useful analogy can be a sail; the light exerting force on mirrors is similar to a wind blown sail. High-energy laser beams could be used as an alternative light source to exert a much greater force than would be possible by using sunlight, a concept known as beam sail. Solar sails offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with long lifespans. Since they have few moving parts and do not use propellant, they can be used on many occasions for the delivery of useful loads."
"The Solar System is the Sun and all the objects in orbit around it. The Sun is in orbit by planets, asteroids, comets and other things. The Sun is a star. It contains 99.9 percent of the mass of the Solar System. This means that it has a high gravity. The other objects are drawn in orbit around the Sun. The Sun is mainly made of hydrogen and helium. There are eight planets in the Solar System. Nearer to the farthest from the Sun, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The first four planets are called terrestrial planets. They are mainly made of rock and metal, and they are mainly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants."
"The solar wind is a flow of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. This plasma consists mainly of electrons, protons and alpha particles with energies generally between 1.5 and 10 keV; integrated into the solar-wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed over time and over solar longitude. Its particles can escape the Sun's gravity due to their high energy, high crown temperature and the magnetic, electrical and electromagnetic phenomena present there. The solar winds flow supersonically at speeds vary according to their origin reaching about one million miles per hour to large distances, filling an area known as the heliosphere, a huge volume of bubbles surrounded by the interstellar medium."
"The Soviet Union (with the exception of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or the USSR) was a Marxist-Leninist State with a single party. It existed from 1922 to 1991 and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of fourteen Soviet Socialist Republics and a Soviet Socialist Federal Republic (Russia). The Soviet Union was created after Alexander Kerensky's overthrow. The communist government developed industry and over time became an important and powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan was the second. The capital of the Soviet Union was Moscow."
"Action films often use special effects to create images that do not exist. There are many types of special effects, for example, making small models or using computer animation. Action films often use special effects to create images that would be dangerous or cost a lot of money to create in real life. For example, if an action film shows a very large combat ship that blows in flames, it would be expensive to buy a combat ship and dangerous to blow it off. For this reason, most action films use special effects if they want to show something that blows in flames. A filmmaker could make a small model of a combat ship that is only a few meters long, then blow it up while filming with the cinema camera. This would be cheaper and safer. Scientific fiction films also often use special effects."
"A species is a kind of organism. It is a basic unit of the biological classification, and an official rank in the taxonomy. Originally, the word was used informally in a rather vague way, but now there are at least 26 different ways that it is used. All animals or plants that are of the same genus belong to the same species. Wolves (Canis lupus) are one species. Humans are another species. Generally speaking, the idea is that (say) cats breed with cats and produce more cats. It is the basis for deciding to have a species called Felis catus. However, giving a simple definition of species is quite difficult, and many people have tried."
"Voice recognition applications include voice interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g., call home), voice routing (e.g., ""I would like to make a collective call""), control of home automation devices, search keywords (e.g., find a podcast where specific words have been spoken), simple data entry (e.g., credit card number entry), preparation of structured documents (e.g., radiology report), identification of the speaker's characteristics, word processing (e.g., text processors or e-mail) and aircraft (usually called direct voice input). Voice recognition or speaker identification refers to the speaker's identification, rather than what they say."
"A steam engine is an engine that uses steam from boiling water to move it. Steam pushes on the engine parts to move it. Steam engines can power many types of machines, including electric vehicles and generators. Steam engines were used in steam pumps from the early 18th century and were greatly improved by James Watt in the 1770s. They were very important during the industrial revolution where they replaced horses, windmills and water mills to work machines. The first steam engines were piston engines. The steam pressure pushed on a piston that made it move along a cylinder and so they had a reciprocal movement (back end). This could move a pump directly or work a crank to turn a wheel and work a machine. They operated at low pressure and had to be very large to make a lot of power."
"The scientists who study memory have described different processes, or types, of memory. A type is called long-term memory, which essentially lasts forever and can store an unlimited amount of information. Long-term memory stores the information we do not currently use, like a library full of books that hold the stories of our lives. Another type of memory, working memory, does not last very long and cannot contain much information. Working memory is the one we use to complete tasks and get information in and out of long-term memory. For example, we use working memory to do things like mental mathematics or to write a story together after listening to a sequence of events. Working memory plays an important role in learning and running tests at school."
"A recent scientific study looked at the impact of different types of foods on human health and environmental health, using statistics (calculations) to study the links between 15 different types of foods and five food-related health conditions and five environmental impacts of food production. For example, scientists examined whether eating vegetables would prevent us from having heart disease and how many greenhouse gases come from vegetable cultivation. They used massive data sets from other studies, which they combined with a statistical method called metaanalysis. Scientists found that foods that were good for our health, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and legumes, were also good for our planet's health."
"The stone age was an ancient time when people made tools from stone. Wood, bones and other materials were also used for tools, but these things did not last as long, so much so that other stone tools were found. Stone (especially a kind of stone called flint) was used to cut things. The period started with the first stone tools, about 2.7 million years ago. Some groups of people were still in the stone age in the 20th century. They also killed animals for food and clothing. The time after the stone age is the bronze age, named after metallic bronze. The stone age came to an end when people discovered the art of cast iron (metal manufacturing)."
"A supernova is when a huge star explodes. It usually occurs when its nuclear fusion cannot hold the nucleus against its own gravity. The nucleus collapses and explodes. The largest supernovaes are called hypergiants and the smallest supergiants. They are massive: because of the gravity, they use their energy very quickly. Normally, they only live for a few million years. During the explosion, the total energy irradiated by the supernovae can briefly exceed the total production of a galaxy. They emit energy equal to that of the whole life of a solar star. The explosion blows its star material away from the star, at speeds up to 30,000 km/s or 10% of the speed of light."
"We sweat constantly, even if we do not notice it. Perspiration is the main way for your body to get rid of excess body heat, which is produced by the metabolism or work of the muscles. The amount of perspiration produced depends on our states of emotion and physical activity. Perspiration can be done in response to nerve stimulation, warm air temperature and/or exercise. First, let's focus on how perspiration is done in an eccrine sweating gland. When the sweating gland is stimulated, the cells secrete a plasma-like fluid (primary secretion) -- that is, it is mainly water and it contains high concentrations of sodium and chloride and low potassium concentration -- but without the proteins and fatty acids normally present in the plasma."
"Technological singularity is the idea that a machine or a computer, or a group of machines and computers, will one day be smarter than humans. Because this has not yet happened, no one really knows what technological singularity will do, or if it will even happen. Nevertheless, technological singularity has been a subject in many science fictional works, such as The Terminator, The Matrix, and the Borg in Star Trek. In most representations of singularity, machines are conscious and humans are considered useless."
"A television (also a television, television or tube) is a machine with a screen. TVs receive broadcasting signals and transform them into images and sounds. The word ""television"" comes from the words tele (Greek for far) and vision (view). Sometimes, a TV can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture. The newer TVs are much lighter and flattering. A TV can show images of many television networks. Computers and mobile devices can also be used to watch television programs. At first, all TVs used an antenna (or antenna)."
"The programmed reduction of temperature (TPR) is a technique for characterizing solid materials and is often used in the field of heterogeneous catalysis to find the most effective reduction conditions, an oxidized catalyst precursor is subjected to a programmed rise of temperature while a mixture of reducing gas is cast on it. It was developed by John Ward Jenkins while developing heterogeneous catalysts for Shell Oil, but has never been patented. A simple container (U-tube) is filled with a solid or catalyst. This sampling vessel is placed in an oven with temperature control equipment. A thermocouple is placed in the solid for temperature measurement. The air originally present in the container is rinsed with an inert gas (nitrogen, argon)."
"Most drugs are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in China, India and the United States. However, regardless of where they are manufactured, pharmaceutical companies should ensure that patients living in other countries have access to medicines. To do so, pharmaceutical companies must register their products and ship them to countries where there is a need. If a drug is not registered in one country, the product cannot be sold there. Although this seems to be an easy procedure, less than a quarter of the recently launched medical products have been filed for registration in most countries where it is needed. The reason that many drugs are not registered is that personalization of registration to meet the strict requirements of each country can be a difficult task for a company, especially as the criteria may vary from country to country. Moreover, the registration process can take a long time in some countries where health care systems are poor."
"In the Jewish faith, after years of studying Hebrew and Torah1, boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 13 take part in a celebration. The ceremony for boys is called bar mitzvah, and the ceremony for girls is called bat mitzvah. This literally translates Hebrew as ""son"" or ""daughter of the commandments."" Jewish historians and scholars offer many different theories about the origin of the ceremony. However, the ceremony has gained importance throughout the Jewish diaspora over the 18th and 19th centuries. Although the Jewish faith has many different sects, boys generally become a bar mitzvah at the age of 13 and girls generally become a bat mitzvah at the age of 12 or 13, depending on the sect."
"When the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a new era of science fiction broke out. The world experienced, for the first time, a technology that could really destroy the world. Japan, reborn from the devastation of the two nuclear bombings, gave the world its easiest sci-fi metaphor for the chaos and destruction of bombings: Godzilla. A new atomic subgenus of attacks by giant mutant creatures was born. Primarily told on the film, these stories helped navigate the anxiety that at any time an unstoppable force could put an end to the world. This trope can still be seen today in the series Cloverfield and the modern remakes of Godzilla."
"Animal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous and epithelial. For example, the origin of cells constituting a particular type of tissue may differ evolutionaryly for different animal classifications. Epithelium in all animals is derived from ectodermis and endoderm, with a small contribution of mesodermis, forming endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes vascularization. However, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together by occlus junctions called tight junctions, to create a selective permeable barrier. This tissue covers all organic surfaces that come into contact with the external environment, such as skin, respiratory tract and digestive tract. It is used for protection, secretion and absorption, and is separated from other tissues by a basal lemonade."
"Totalitarianism is a political system in which the State recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate all aspects of public and private life wherever possible. Totalitarian regimes remain in political power through a comprehensive propaganda campaign, which is disseminated through the mass media controlled by the State, a single party often marked by political repression, the cult of personality, economic control, regulation and restriction of speech, mass surveillance and the widespread use of terror."
"The transistors have three terminals: the door, the drain, and the source (on a bipolar transistor, the wires can be called the transmitter, the collector and the base). When the source (or the transmitter) is connected to the negative terminal of the battery, and the drain (or the collector) to the positive terminal, no electricity will flow into the circuit (if you have only one lamp in series with the transistor). But when you touch the door and the drain together, the transistor will let the electricity pass. This is because when the door is positively charged, the positive electrons will push other positive electrons into the transistor allowing the negative electrons to pass. The transistor can also work when the door is positively charged, so it does not need to touch the drain. An easy way to think how a transistor works is like a pipe with a sharp bend that prevents the water from passing. The water is the electrons, and when you positively charge the door, it removes the hose, letting the water run."
"The Treaty of Ghent (8 Stat. 218), signed on December 24, 1814, in the city of Ghent, was the peace treaty that ended the war of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. The treaty restored relations between the two nations to the status quo ante bellum, restoring the borders of the two countries to the lines before the beginning of the war in June 1812. The treaty was approved by the British Parliament and signed by Prince Regent (the future King George IV) on December 30, 1814. It took a month for the peace treaty to reach the United States and, in the meantime, the American forces under Andrew Jackson won the battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. The Treaty of Ghent was not fully in force until its unanimous ratification by the United States Senate on February 18, 1815. It began two centuries of peaceful relations between the United States and Great Britain, although there were some tense moments like the Trent affair."
"According to historian James T. Patterson, ""Truman's doctrine was a very publicized commitment that the administration had not undertaken before. His moving rhetoric, promising that the United States would help all ""free people"" to be subjected, paved the way for countless subsequent projects that led to commitments of globalization. This was thus a major step."" According to historian Dennis Merill, this doctrine endured, because it dealt with the broader cultural insecurity regarding modern life in a globalized world. It addressed Washington's concern about the domino effect of communism, it allowed a sensitive media presentation of the doctrine that received bipartite support, and it mobilized American economic power to modernize and stabilize unstable regions without direct military intervention."
"Ultrasounds are sound waves whose frequencies are higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasounds are not different from ""normal"" (audible) sounds in their physical properties, except that humans cannot hear it. This limit varies from person to person and is about 20 kilohertz (20,000 hertz) in healthy young adults. Ultrasounds work with frequencies ranging from 20 kHz to several gigahertz. Ultrasounds are used in many areas. Ultrasounds are used to detect objects and measure distances. Ultrasound imaging or sonography is often used in medicine."
"After the First World War, the nations of the world formed the League of Nations. This organization was a place where nations could speak through their differences calmly. However, some countries such as Germany, Italy and Japan ignored the League and tried to solve their problems by war. The members of the League of Nations did not want to go to war to protect other members and the League failed. A second world war soon began. The Allies of the Second World War often called themselves ""the United Nations"" (united against the Axis powers). After the war, the winners formed a new organization for world peace. On 25 April 1945 in San Francisco, they decided the name ""UN"". In June, they signed the Charter of the United Nations saying how the organization would work. The UN was created on 24 October 1945 and its first meeting took place in January 1946."
"Unstructured data (or unstructured data) refer to information that either does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined way. Unstructured information is generally rich in text but may contain data such as dates, figures and facts. This leads to irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand the use of traditional programs compared to data stored in databases or annotated (seminanally labelled) in documents. In 1998, Merrill Lynch cited a thumb rule according to which about 80-90% of all potentially usable business information may come from unstructured sources. This thumb rule is not based on primary or quantitative research, but is nevertheless accepted by some."
"The atmosphere is the air that surrounds the Earth. The air that surrounds you today is part of the atmosphere. Every day, weather changes. Sometimes it is hot. Other times, we have snowstorms. The weather makes you guess. It makes every day an adventure. Whatever the weather does now, it could do something else in a few hours. The weather can also vary from place to place. Sometimes, the places are very close. It could rain to your home, but dry at school a few blocks away. The weather is very difficult to predict. Is it raining tomorrow? Maybe it will make the sun. What about the wind? What will be the cold? These are all the questions we want to know. Meteorologists are scientists who study the weather and weather forecasts. Meteorologists measure many different weather conditions to describe and predict weather."
"A vaccine confers immunity to an infectious disease caused by a particular bacterium or virus, which means that the vaccine makes a person less likely to get the disease. For example, the influenza vaccine makes it less likely that a person can get the flu. Vaccines are usually made from something that is alive, or that was alive. The word ""vaccine"" comes from the Latin words immunize us (from the word vaccine, i.e. cow). In 1796, Edward Jenner used smallpox infected cows (variolae vaccineae) to protect people from smallpox. The use of vaccines is called vaccination. Edward Jenner created the first vaccine in the 1770s."
"The outer space has a very low density and pressure and is the closest physical approximation to a perfect vacuum. But no vacuum is really perfect, not even in the interstellar space, where there are still a few hydrogen atoms per cubic metre. Stars, planets and moons keep their atmosphere by gravitational attraction, and as such, the atmospheres have no clearly defined limit: the density of the atmospheric gas decreases simply with the distance of the object. The atmospheric pressure of the Earth falls to about 3.2×10-2 Pa at 100 kilometers of altitude, the Kármán line, which is a common definition of the boundary with the outer space."
"It is a general term, without specific reference to taxa, life forms, structure, spatial extent or other specific botanical or geographical characteristics. It is broader than the term flora which refers to the composition of species. Perhaps the closest synonym is the plant community, but vegetation can, and often does, refer to a wider range of spatial scales than this term does, including scales as large as the world. Sequoia forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, weed plots, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are covered by the term vegetation. The type of vegetation is defined by characteristic dominant species, or a common aspect of assemblage, such as an elevation area or an environmental community."
"The speed of an object is the rate of change of its position in relation to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. The velocity is equivalent to a specification of its speed and direction of movement (e.g. 60 km/h to the north). The velocity is an important concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the movement of the bodies. The velocity is a quantity of physical vector; both magnitude and direction are necessary to define it. The absolute scalar value (magnitude) of the speed is called ""speed"", being a coherent derivative unit whose quantity is measured in the SI system (metric) in meters per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m·s-1). For example, ""5 meters per second"" is a scalar (not a vector), while ""5 meters per second is a vector. If there is a change of speed, direction, or both, then the object has a changing speed and is said to undergo an acceleration."
"Neuromyths are important because they affect people's thoughts and behaviour: they can change the way we see each other and how we see each other. Let's take the example of sex again. At the age of 8-9, there is no difference in how girls and boys do math, but girls (and their parents) assess their ability to be weaker than boys in math. This suggests that what people believe (in this case, girls are not as strong in math) can have a real impact on how children see each other, which in turn can affect their actual performance."
"A method to realize virtual reality is virtual reality based on simulation. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver the impression of actually driving a vehicle by predicting the vehicle movement caused by the driver's input and giving the driver the corresponding visual signals, movements and audio. With virtual reality based on the avatar image, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. You can participate in the virtual environment distributed in 3D as a form of conventional avatar or real video. A user can choose his or her own type of participation according to the capacity of the system. In virtual reality based on the projector, real environment modelling plays a vital role in various applications of virtual reality, such as robotic navigation, construction modelling and aircraft simulation."
"The body's first line of defense against viruses is the innate immune system. This has cells and other mechanisms that defend the host of any infection. Innate system cells recognize and respond to pathogens in a general way. RNA interference is an important innate defense against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double stranded RNA (dsRNA DNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule. A protein complex called dictating it glues and cuts RNA into pieces. Then a biochemical pathway, called RISC complex, begins. This attacks viral mRNA, and the cell survives infection."
"The voltage is also called electric voltage or electromotive force (EMF). It is named after Alessandro Volta. Technically, the voltage is the difference of electrical potential between two points. The voltage is always measured between two points, for example between the positive and negative ends of a battery, or between a wire and the ground. As shown in the hydraulic analogy of volt, the voltage can be seen as the pressure on the electrons to exit from the source. It is directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the electrons. In other words, the higher the voltage, the higher the pressure. For example, a battery of 3 volts will exert pressure on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of 1.5 volts. The voltage can push the electrons into a component, like a resistance, creating a current. Usually, the voltage and current are bound by a formula."
"The voltage is always measured between two points, and one of them is often called the ground point, or the zero-volt point (0V). In most AC electrical installations, there is a connection to the earth. A connection is made to the real ground through a pipe of water, a ground rod buried or driven into the earth, or a practical metal conductor (not a gas pipe) buried underground. This connection is made at the entrance point of the electrical system in a building, at each pole where there is a transformer in the street (often on an electric pole), and at other places in the system. The entire planet Earth is used as a reference point for measuring voltage. In one building this ground is carried to each electrical device on two wires. One is the ""earth conductor"" (green or naked wire) and is used as a safety ground to connect metallic parts of the equipment to the earth. The other is used as one of the electric conductors in the system circuits and is called the ""neutral conductor""."
"A wrist watch has the advantage of being portable compared to traditional watches. Watches evolved in the 17th century from spring clocks, which appeared in the 14th century. In 1524, Peter Henlein created the first pocket watch. The first watches were strictly mechanical, driven by watchmaking. Like the developed technology, mechanical watches were largely replaced by vibrating quartz crystals, producing precise electronic impulses. Some watches use radio technology to correct time and date. The first digital electronic watch was developed in 1970. Electronic movements, also called quartz movements, have few or no mobile parts, except a quartz crystal that is made to vibrate by piezoelectric effect."
"A water clock, or clepsydra, is any watch in which the time is measured by the regulated flow of the liquid to (type of flow) or from (type of flow) a ship where the quantity is then measured. Water clocks, as well as sundials and sundials, are likely to be the oldest measuring instruments of the time, with the exception of vertical gnomon and day counting stick. Where and when they were invented is not known, and given their great antiquity, it may never be. Bol-shaped flow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in Babylon and Egypt around the 16th century BC. Other parts of the world, including India and China, also have early evidence of water clocks, but the first dates are less secure. Some authors, however, claim that water clocks appeared in China as early as 4000 JC."
"Water vapour, water vapour or aqueous vapour, is the gas phase of water. It is a state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapour can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Unlike other forms of water, water vapour is invisible. Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapour is produced continuously by evaporation and eliminated by condensation. It is lighter than air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds."
"Watergate is a major political scandal that occurred in the United States in the early 1970s following a break-in in June 1972 at the headquarters of the National Democratic Committee (NDC) at the headquarters of the Watergate office in Washington, D.C. and the attempt to conceal its involvement by the administration of President Richard Nixon. When the plot was discovered and investigated by the United States Congress, the Nixon administration's resistance to its probes led to a constitutional crisis. The term Watergate came to include a range of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by Nixon administration members."
"A white dwarf, also known as a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar remnant composed mainly of electrodegenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of the Earth. The low brightness of a white dwarf comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf where the mass is converted into energy. The closest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light-years, the smallest component of the Sirius binary star. It is currently thought that there are eight white dwarfs among the systems hundred stars closest to the Sun. The unusual weakness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was invented by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe did not exist long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all its energy as it will take nearly a thousand billion years."
"Wi-Fi stations communicate by sending other data packages: data blocks sent and delivered individually by radio. As with any radio, this is done by modulation and demodulation of carrier waves. Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses the DSS on a single medium, while 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use several media on slightly different frequencies within the channel (OFDM). As with other LAN IEEE 802, stations are programmed with a global 48-bit MAC address (often printed on the equipment) so that each Wi-Fi station has a unique address. MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data package."
"The Zimmermann Telegram (also known as Zimmermann Note) was a telegram sent to Mexico from Germany on January 16, 1917. That's what brought America into World War I. He is named for the German man who sent him, Arthur Zimmermann. Zimmerman was the German Secretary for Foreign Affairs (who took care of things with other countries). Zimmermann sent him to the German ambassador to the United States, Johann von Bernstorff. Bernstorff then sent him to the German ambassador to Mexico, Heinrich von Eckardt. The telegram told the ambassador to ask the Mexicans to join the war on the German side by attacking America. Germany promised to help Mexico take over the land that the United States had taken from Mexico in the war between Mexico and Arizona. It was Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Germany wanted Mexico to enter the war so that America was too busy to help the enemies of Germany."
"In the Mediterranean Sea, new species frequently arrive through various routes of introduction. Due to the large number of new exotic species and the large size of the Mediterranean Sea, it is very difficult to detect new alien species. Scientists in many countries are working hard to find, observe and monitor exotic species here, and gather as much information as possible. However, not only scientists can spot exotic species. Many people visit the Mediterranean Sea to swim, dive or fish. These citizens are also invited to report exotic species to the blogs and authorities responsible for this threat. We call this citizen science – the contribution of citizens to the collection of data, which helps scientists."
"There are many types of particles that could enter the lungs and cause damage. Some of these particles are pollutants, such as emissions from gas-fired vehicles, carbon monoxide from households, toxins caused by vaping or smoking, and aerosols such as hair sprays. Particulate matter can be trapped in various areas of the lung. Short hairs, such as the type on the head, border the inside of the nostrils and are covered with mucus. These mucus-covered hairs help capture larger particles when entering the nose. Particulate matter entering the driving area can injure the cells of the respiratory tract, which can reduce the movement of their cilia and lead to an accumulation of mucus that cannot be removed from the respiratory tract."
"3D (or 3-D) means three dimensions, or three dimensions. For example, a box is three-dimensional; it is solid, and not thin as a piece of paper. It has a volume, top and bottom, left and right (the sides), as well as a forehead and back. You can turn the box around to see it on another side (called a face, surface or simply side). A dimension is measurable in inches, microns, miles, kilometers, or any other unit of length. The three dimensions are often called length (or depth), width (or width), and height. Some goals use other words. 3D graphics are used to make animated video games or movies. Many calculations are necessary to make images appear three-dimensional on a screen. Modern computers usually have a GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) to write them, or if a value is not known."
"First of all, doctors need to determine what type of stroke has taken place. This is important because each type of stroke requires different treatment. Using brain scanning devices, doctors need to determine if bleeding or blockage causes patients' symptoms. If a blockage (ischaemic stroke) is identified, the purpose of the treatment is to remove the clot. (That's why these treatments are called clots!) Medicines for clots are given to the patient to break and dissolve the clot that causes blockage. Or, surgery can be performed and a wire can be sent to the blood vessel to extract the clot. If a bleeding (haemorrhagic stroke) is identified, the purpose of the treatment is to stop bleeding and reduce the pressure accumulated inside the skull."
"About 20,000 years ago, the last cooling phase ended, beginning with a period of warming up to about 8,000 years ago, during which the average temperature of the Earth increased from 5.6 to 8.5°F (3.1 to 4.7°C). This means a change of about 0.06°F (0.03°C) each century. Between 8,000 years and the Industrial Revolution (about 200 years ago), temperatures were relatively constant. Since then, temperatures have increased again and very rapidly. In 2100, scientists believe that the average temperature of the planet will have increased from 3.6 to 8.8°F (2.0 to 4.9°C) compared to temperatures at the time of the Industrial Revolution. This means that the rise in the temperature of the planet in the next century will be about 100 times faster than that of the last 20,000 years."
"Each year, there is a period of time (a influenza season), during which most cases of influenza occur, usually during the winter, but this may vary depending on where you live. For example, in the tropics, the influenza season tends to reach its highest point of the rainy season. Influenza viruses also change (or mutate) from year to year, so that your immune system no longer recognizes them and is less able to protect you from infections and diseases. This means that every year, scientists have to check which influenza viruses infect people and design new vaccines to protect them from these current viral strains. Each year, influenza vaccines are usually composed of a mixture of 3 or 4 strains that correspond to the main circulating strains. Sometimes, new strains of viruses emerge completely different from the circulating viral strains."
"The reaction times are quite different when the target shares some, but not all, of the characteristics of some circuit breakers. In this case, the target does not come out (""target non-pop-out"") and the reaction times increase depending on the number of objects in the visual scene. Why does this happen? What is the simplest explanation for both types of reaction time models? A critical overview came when Treisman and his colleagues looked closely at the errors made by the observers. When observers misunderstood what the target was (for example, when they reported that the man-out was a red vertical bar, when it was actually a red horizontal bar, they were also likely to distort the location of the target. This means that, to find a target correctly, you also need to perceive the target correctly."
"Animals can feel it from birth, even if the skin of a newborn is very simple. The epidermis of a newborn is composed of only one or two leaves of epidermal cells, and a small number of touch sensitive neurons send axons to the epidermis. As the newborns mature in adults, the skin thickens to cover the animal much larger, the epidermis thickens by adding more layers of cells, and new neurons sensitive to the touch are born. In addition to the growth and thickening, during this period, special structures – such as hair in mammals, feathers in birds or scales in fish – are formed inside the skin."
"In terms of mental health among young people, these changes can make the brain very sensitive to injuries. Let's start by talking about how different areas of the brain are connected to each other. Regions of the brain need to communicate with each other so that we can think, plan and perform tasks in daily life. The brain is made up of grey matter and white matter. Grey matter contains the cellular bodies of the neurons (which are the building blocks of the brain that process the information). White matter consists of parts of neurons called axons, which are connections that connect different areas of grey matter together. During adolescence, white matter begins to decide which areas of the brain should be connected most. Think of this as a road map. Large cities are visited more often, so highways are built to ensure that people can access these places quickly and easily."
"An ancestor is a person from whom one descends. Usually, he refers to a distant person, rather than to immediate parents or grandparents. A very similar word is the ancestor. A female ancestor can be called an ancestor. The line of people from whom one person descends is called their ancestry. A second meaning refers to evolution. It is used from an animal or plant from which others have evolved. In a similar way, it can be used for an early prototype or precursor of a later device. In law an ancestor can mean the person from which a succession is legally obtained. No blood relationship is necessarily implicit. More often, however, it is the person from which a succession is obtained on the basis of law and blood. Two people have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other, or if they share a common ancestor. Each of the ancestors of someone has contributed to their DNA."
"Ancient Egypt, or the Egyptian Empire, was a society that began about 3150 B.C., and lasted until 20 B.C. when it was invaded by the Roman Empire. It grew up along the Nile and was at its most powerful in the second millennium B.C. Its land passed from the Nile Delta to Nubia, a kingdom that is now mainly in Sudan. For most of its history, Egypt was prosperous, since the Nile water assured that the Egyptians would have good harvests."
"There are underground locations that can store large volumes of CO2 gas. These locations are the almost infinite number of small holes inside the rocks. Underground rocks form layers that go several kilometres in all directions and can be many metres thick. These layers are called aquifers. The aquifers contain water that can move freely through the rocks, through the small holes. When CO2 gas is injected into one of these aquifers, it can be stabilized so as not to ""let go"" into the atmosphere. CO2 is stabilized when it becomes trapped in the small holes of the rocks. Large outdoor experiments have shown that these aquifers can remain stable over long periods of time. However, very little is known about how CO2 affects the microbes living underground. Microbes are microscopic organisms, including bacteria, which are the type of microbe we have studied in our experiments. It is important to understand how bacteria react to underground CO2 because, through their metabolism, the bacteria can change the greenhouse more."
"You probably heard the word ""values."" Perhaps it was mentioned by your teacher at school who talked about what is important in class. For example, if your teacher talked about the importance of getting good grades, they were referring to values of achievement. If your teacher said it's good to be curious and explore new ideas, they were referring to values of self-direction. Maybe you've read values in a newspaper or heard about them on television. Politicians often talk about values in their countries, for example, how important it is for everyone to be safe (security values) and everyone to follow the rules (conformity values)."
"When she finished a plate of her father's famous scrambled eggs with jalapeños and hot tortillas, she rushed into the closet to dig her crampons. Can I really become a better soccer player? she asked herself. Laura ran to get a soccer ball from the garage, but her mother said, ""We won't need that."" ""Why?"" Laura asked. ""You're going to see. Come on!"" Her mother put herself on the street with a tote bag on her shoulder and a jumbo box of garbage bags under her arm. Flowering, Laura followed her mother to a vacant lot a few blocks away from their house. Although the land was certainly large enough to practice dribbling, he was also full of weeds, old tires, rusty cans, and taking cardboard. Laura raised her eyebrows."
"Archaeology is the study of the past by searching for the remains and artifacts (historical objects) left by the people who lived a long time ago. These remains can include old pieces, tools, buildings and inscriptions. Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived. Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from. When archaeologists do field work, they search for remains, often by digging down the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of field work are brought back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, perhaps a university or a museum. They record everything they found by writing on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build an image of everything that is found."
"Imagine a person who has fallen into a coma. A coma can occur in many causes, such as a traumatic brain injury, a stroke, or perhaps a loss of oxygen from a close drowning. The comatose person is always lying on the bed, with his eyes closed. The person does not show any sign of communication with the environment. We speak to the comatose person, but it does not respond and seems indifferent to everything that happens. When a person is in a coma, that person is in what we call an unconscious state. But does the brain of a coma patient still work? There is a good chance that a person's brain in a coma will continue to deal with environmental events, such as the traces of someone who approaches or the sound of your voice when you speak to them."
"Our cells have an alarm system that triggers when they become ill and harmful to the body. These sick cells send emergency signals, like a S.O.S., telling the body to set up its defense. This phenomenon is called ""apoptosis"", which is a process of self-destruction, or scheduled suicide, of cells. Most of the time this alarm system works perfectly, but there are exceptions, as in brain cancer known as glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is a rare cancer with ""only"" 250,000 new cases each year. Unfortunately, it is also aggressive cancer and so far we do not know how to cure patients with glioblastoma. However, remember that every day, research is making progress in cancer treatments. Today, we know how to treat many types of cancer, such as breast cancer, so that patients can continue to live long lives."
"With the restoration of Babylonian independence, a new era of construction followed, and Nebuchadnezzar II (604-561 B.C.) made Babylon one of the wonders of the old world. Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial lands, including the reconstruction of the Etémenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate, the most spectacular of the eight gates that rang the perimeter of Babylon. All that was found from the original gate of Ishtar was the foundation and scattered bricks. Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the hanging gardens of Babylon (one of the seven wonders of the old world), said to have been built for his bad wife Amyite."
"If you think of your body as a super-organism composed of both human cells and bacterial cells, your gut microbiota represents 90% of the total cells of this super-organism! The intestine microbiota is composed of heroes and villains. The heroes of the intestine are beneficial micro-organisms that have critical roles in the human intestines: they help digestion, provide essential nutrients, help the immune system and fight against food poisoning and disease. These heroes are in a permanent truce with villains who are also known as pathobionts, which is any potentially pathogenic micro-organism that lives without causing disease. The interaction between beneficial and pathogenic micro-organisms in the intestine is extremely critical to human health and the balance is very fragile. Unfortunately, under certain conditions when the truce is violated, pathobion can harm us and cause disease."
"Blu-ray is the type of disc used for PlayStation 3 games and for high definition (HD) movies. In the past, there were other standards for these movies, such as HD DVD format. Blu-ray has won what is called the format war. A double layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50 GB (gigabytes) of data. This is more than five times the capacity of a DVD, and more than 70 times more than a CD or VCD. The disc was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA). A group of consumer electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers. The format has been developed to allow recording, rewriting and playback of high definition (HD) videos, as well as storage of large amounts of data."
"Now we know how to discover a planet – we measure the brightness of a star very carefully for a while, and if it plunges into brightness for a few hours during a transit, we may have discovered a planet! But since 2000, thousands of planets have been discovered. How have astronomers found so many? Most of the planets discovered so far have been found by the Kepler Space Telescope, which has looked at 150,000 stars for four years, taking accurate measurements of brightness every half hour. More than 2,000 stars have shown transits in light measurements, revealing the presence of an entire zoo of planets as small as Mercury to larger than Jupiter, and everything in between. One of the greatest surprises that the Kepler Space Telescope has discovered was that the most common size of a planet lies between the size of the Earth and Neptune. The Earth is the largest rock planet in the solar system, and Neptune is the smallest gas planet in the solar system."
"Biomaterials can take different forms and be made from many different materials. Ideally, biomaterials should have a porous structure, which means that they have small holes that allow gases, liquids and even cells to move through them, such as the organ or tissue they aim to heal. Cells that help heal can also be loaded into small pores in the biomaterial. This way, a porous biomaterial can be used to deliver cells to damaged tissue. The biomaterial helps keep new cells in the tissue where they are needed to promote healing."
"The deep convection in the ocean depends on the temperature of the water, but also on the salinity of the water. The colder and saltier the water, the more oxygen it can absorb. Now that the Earth is warming up, snow, glaciers and polar ice caps can melt. This is particularly bad in polar regions, because the fresh water of this melting ice flows into the sea and forms a much less salty layer of water than sea water. This can lead to less oxygen absorbed by the ocean, which means that there will be less oxygen for life in the oceans."
"Most of the cave paintings are from 10,000 to 20,000 years old. The oldest ones date from about 32,000 years ago, but scientists still do not agree if this dating is correct. We don't know why these paintings were made. Most people think that they could have had a function for rituals. They may also have been a way of transiting information; to tell others of something. Most of the paintings are in caves that are difficult to access. These caves don't usually show that people lived there all year round. Today, there are about 350 well-known caves that have paintings in them. Many are in France and Spain. The best known are probably the caves of Altamira (Spain), Lascaux (France), or Creswell Crags in England. Sometimes, paintings were also made on cliffs."
"Today, we know that these changes are caused by mutations. Mutations are changes in the genes of one organism. Genes are instructions that all living organisms possess. Each gene is composed of a unique combination of four molecules called nucleotides: adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. The order of these nucleotides, called genetic sequence, determines the function of each gene. The total of all the genes of a organism is called genome. The genome contains information coding for all the characteristics of one organism, so that a change in one or more nucleotides of a gene (called genetic change) can disturb a characteristic of the organism, such as the colour of the eyes, its height or how it treats food. This genetic information is inherited, meaning that it is transmitted from one generation to another. Mutations in genes can occur spontaneously or in response to stressors in the environment, but whatever the cause, all mutations are random."
"The brain is not a rigid network of neurons put into a given arrangement for life, like an old electrical card. The brain constantly tries to find better ways to provide and process information by creating or removing connections between neurons. This phenomenon of neural changes is called neuroplasty. When babies discover the world around them with their five senses, their brain undergoes intense development and remodeling. Later, when children learn to ride a bike, catch a ball or play a musical instrument, there happens more remodeling, allowing the child to perform complicated actions without actually thinking about each stage involved. When you capture a ball that flies towards you, you do not consciously think of using specific muscles at specific times, you simply catch the ball, because your brain already knows what muscles need to be activated and when. Neuroplasty continues to occur throughout a person's life and can have lasting effects depending on your experience in a given activity: this is why, for example, the more competent you are, the more you are, the more you are, the more you are, the more you are, the more you become, the more competent you are, the more you become."
"The human brain is responsible for many functions, and some areas of the brain are responsible for specific tasks. For example, the part of the brain called motor cortex controls the movements of fingers, hands, legs, arms and other parts of the body. The motor cortex has a lot of brain tissue for the movements of hands and fingers, which we need to write, hold a screwdriver, or thread a needle. On the other hand, we do not have a very precise control of our leg muscles, and therefore the motor cortex can control the movements of the legs without as much cerebral tissue. Another important area of the brain is the somatosensorial cortex, which is responsible for the sense of touch."
"Habitat fragmentation is now recognized as one of the greatest threats to the survival of many terrestrial species, including birds. What is even more worrying is that humans benefit from the many vital services that birds provide. For example, many birds are important predators of ""pest"" species, such as mosquitoes and rodents, and birds can also be pollinators of many plant species. In fact, a study found that 33% of birds are involved in the spread of plant seeds that are of medical and economic importance to humans. There are even some birds that are so critical to the functioning of ecosystems that without them these ecosystems collapse."
"Containerization has its origins in coal mining areas in England from the end of the 18th century. The ""storage boxes"" were used to containerize coal from the late 1780s, to places such as the Bridgewater Canal. They were used to move coal on and off barges. By the 1830s, railways on several continents were carrying containers that could be transferred to other modes of transport. The Liverpool and Manchester railway in the United Kingdom was such. ""simple wooden boxes, four to one wagon, they were used to transport coal from the Lancashire mines to Liverpool, where they were transferred to carts pulled by horses by cranes""."
"Depression is a mental illness that affects millions of people. It affects the way a person thinks, feels and behaves. Depression is more intense than the experience of sadness. Important symptoms of depression include bad mood, loss of pleasure, loss of weight or gain, low energy, and feelings of despair. These symptoms last more than 2 weeks and interfere with a person's daily activities. Depression affects the depressed person, the person's family, and the community. In the United States, more than $80 billion a year is spent on depression."
"By filtering out any non-important background information, attention helps you to focus on different tasks such as drawing a complex scene, playing video games or reading this article. Attention can also help you to focus on particularly important information, such as a mermaid or your name, so attention is a very necessary skill for humans. Imagine how difficult it would be if you wanted to focus your attention on something important but could not, or if your attention could not alert you to important changes in the environment. You would not be able to do your homework, learn a new skill, or even cross a busy street! Because attention is so important, researchers are curious how the brain knows what to pay attention to, especially when there are so many things going on around us."
"In general, only one person at a time can integrate into an MRI scanner. Thus, it may seem impossible to scan someone's brain during social interaction. But neuroscientists have found creative ways around this problem. For example, in an experiment, the participants in the scanner were connected to someone in another room through a live video stream, and they played a simple game together. This social interaction led to activation in brain regions similar to those activated in mentalization studies. This result could mean that we automatically mind each time we interact with others. However, because the game did not require players to think about mental states, we cannot be sure that the areas activated during the game were exactly the same as the participants use when they mentalize."
"A fuel cell made of electricity from hydrogen. Hydrogen is very common, but difficult to store. It can be made from water but is usually made of natural gas. These cars are very rare, because there are not many places where hydrogen can be filled, and so not many are made. One of the few companies that manufactures fuel cell cars is Toyota, which has the Mirai. A solar cell stores energy from the sun as well as electricity to pass the car. But the sun that lands on a solar car is not enough to make a large car move very quickly, and can not work at night unless it stores energy somewhere. There is a competition every year to see who can make a car that goes the farthest on solar energy."
"The electromagnets can be reinforced by adding more coils to the copper wire or by adding an iron core through the coils (e.g. a nail). The current can also be increased to make the magnetism stronger. The British electrician William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1825. An electromagnet is useful because it can be switched on and off easily (using an electric current), while a permanent magnet cannot be turned off and will continue to affect its immediate environment. Different alloys act differently. The iron ceases to be an electromagnet very quickly, but the steel takes time to wear. To make an electromagnet, the copper wire is wrapped around an iron rod. Both ends of the wire are connected to the + (positive) and - (negative) side of the battery. The electromagnets are used in everyday items such as burglar alarms, electric relays and fire bells."
"Electromagnetic waves are waves that contain an electric field and a magnetic field and carry energy. They travel at the speed of light. Quantum mechanics developed from the study of electromagnetic waves, which include visible light seen in the colors of the rainbow, but also other waves that include more energetic and higher frequency waves such as ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays, plus waves with longer wavelengths, including infrared waves, microwaves and radio waves. Certain types of electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays, are ionizing radiation and can be harmful to your body."
"Sometimes, the parts of the brain needed to use the tongue are affected by serious health problems. Our brains need a lot of oxygen and nutrients to function. Oxygen and nutrients are brought to the brain by blood, which passes through our arteries. Unfortunately, sometimes these arteries are obstructed or broken during strokes. Brain areas that no longer receive blood flow after a stroke suffer a lack of oxygen and nutrients, so that the brain tissue ends up damaged and does not function as well as it was before. After enough time without oxygen and nutrients, these brain areas will die. In 2015, there were 613,148 strokes in the EU, and this number is expected to increase to 819,771 in 2035."
"You may know that a nutritious diet full of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, nuts, seeds and proteins is good for your health. This type of diet is not only delicious, but it makes people stronger and healthy. On the other hand, eating processed foods and drinks rich in saturated animal fats and sugar, such as processed meats, cookies, sweets, sweet drinks and potato chips, can be very harmful to your health. Did you know that eating these types of foods regularly can cause diseases, such as obesity, the condition of excessive overweight. In most cases, obesity is due to unhealthy diet and lack of exercise."
"It's hard to count rhinoceros! Think about what would happen if you went into the woods and tried to count all the birds around you. Some birds would fly everywhere, and some would hide as soon as they saw you. Other birds would be in the trees and you wouldn't even know they were there. So, if you go into the tropical forest and try to count all the Javan rhinoceros, you would probably count zero! Obviously, rhinoceros can't fly, but you get the picture — rhinoceros can be very secretive and don't like to be around humans. Moreover, the tropical forest is thick with thousands of trees and plants gathered together."
"The animals agreed, and immediately took hooves, shovels, and picks, and began to dig a well. Hare had not come, but the other animals went on without him. They dug, and they dug again. And finally they struck water. When they struck water, Lion said, ""Why didn't Hare come to help? He won't drink this water!"" Later Hare came and saw the well. He said, ""Hello? But he didn't hear anything. Then he entered and fell into the water for a while. The next day, when the animals arrived, they saw that their well was a big waste. The water was nothing but mud."
"A tangent galvanometer is an early measuring instrument used to measure the electrical current. It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It derives its name from its principle of operation, the tangent law of magnetism, which indicates that the tangent of the angle that a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the forces of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by Claude Servis Mathias Pouillet in 1837. A tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of copper wire isolated on a non-magnetic circular frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base equipped with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally in the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a small magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants."
"The treatment with the product Glybera uses a virus to infect muscle cells with a working copy of the gene. The European Commission has given the authorization to place Glybera on the market, which means that it can be sold throughout the EU. One in one million people has damaged copies of the lipase gene necessary to break down fat. Fat accumulates in their blood; this leads to pain and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). It endangers life. Up to now, the only way to manage the state is to have a very low fat diet. When used in this way, a virus is a vector. This means that it is a carrier; the gene has been inserted into the viral genome, and the virus sticks it into human cells."
"Geometry is a kind of mathematics that studies the size, shapes and positions of things. There are flat (2D) and solid (3D) shapes in geometry. Squares, circles and triangles are some of the simplest forms in flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry. Geometry can be used to measure the surface and perimeter of a flat shape. It can also be used to measure the volume and surface of a solid form. Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find: the surface of a house, so that they can buy the right amount of paint the volume of a box, to see if it is large enough to hold a litre of food the area of a farm, so that it can be divided in equal parts the distance around the edge of a pond, to know how much fence to buy."
"Geothermal energy is produced by the heat inside the earth's crust. It is clean and sustainable. Although the Sun heats the Earth's surface, the heat inside the Earth is not caused by the Sun. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust comes from 20% of the initial formation of the planet and 80% of the radioactive decomposition of the minerals. The Earth is the warmest at its heart and, from heart to surface, the temperature is gradually cooling. The geothermal energy resources range from shallow to hot water and the hot rock is a few kilometres below the Earth's surface, and even deeper at the extremely high temperatures of the melted rock called magma. It has been used to bathe from the paleolithic era, but is now better known to produce electricity. All over the world, geothermal energy was used to produce about 10 gigawatts of electricity in 2007, and to give 0.3% of the electricity needed worldwide."
"Exercise can improve mood and reduce symptoms of mental illness, including depression and anxiety. Exercise can also improve sleep quality, increase energy levels and reduce stress. Exercise has also been shown to increase self-confidence and improve memory and concentration. In addition, exercise offers all these benefits without the risk of serious side effects. It has been said that, if exercise was a pill, it would be prescribed to each patient by each physician. The benefits of exercise are ""transdiagnostic"", meaning that whatever mental illness a person may experience, everyone can still get some benefits of exercise. The benefits may differ slightly depending on the symptoms experienced. For example, for a person with depression, exercise can help improve sleep quality or help motivate to get out of bed, while for a person with anxiety symptoms, exercise can be a distraction from constant anxiety."
"Thomas Edison made phonographs in the 1870s. He originally used the tin sheet to record the sound. Soon wax cylinders were used instead of the tin sheet. The cylinders could be removed from the machine and restarted without destroying the recording. Although the discs were made in 1888, it was not until 1902 that the discs became more popular than the cylinder discs. The discs were first made of a mixture of shellac and then polyvinyl chloride, often abbreviated as ""vinyl""."
"It is very common for people to think that the brain controls all the movements we make. When we think about moving, the signals move from the brain to the spinal cord through the nerves (almost like the phone wires). The spinal cord acts as a highway with many exits in both directions. In one direction, the information of the senses moves towards the brain, and in the other direction, the signals are carried from the brain to control the muscles. The actions of these muscles are what makes the arms and legs move. However, the brain is not always necessary to provoke movement. By examining the animals, the scientists have discovered that complex groups of cells in the spinal cord can control the walk. It turns out that the main work of controlling the walk is done by the spinal cord, not the brain."
"The Red Sea is a very warm sea compared to other places. There, summer temperatures can reach up to 34°C, while other oceanic waters can reach between 29 and 32°C. It is interesting to note that the corals of the Red Sea do not only live in higher temperatures, but also in higher salinity, or the amount of salt in water, for example, in sea water. You can find a range of different salinities in the ocean, depending on the region. The Red Sea has some of the highest salt levels. Salinity is a measure of the amount of salt in water, and the Red Sea has some of the highest salt levels in the world. That's why we started to wonder if salinity could be a piece of the puzzle and the ability to live in a high salinity one of the secrets of the strong corals of the Red Sea."
"During the Second World War, the wounded soldiers on the battlefield were in a great deal of pain. Medical staff gave them morphine, an analgesic that is still in use today. At one point the morphine started to run out, and the soldiers were left in pain. There seemed to be no way to help them — but then one of the nurses had a brilliant idea: she collected the empty morphine syringes, filled them with water and injected the wounded soldiers. Surprisingly, they quickly felt less pain! After the war, one of the doctors who had seen what the brilliant nurse had done began to study the subject of placebos. He made some spectacular discoveries. It turns out that patients with certain diseases are actually improving after receiving placebo. Pain is a problem that reacts very well to placebos."
"The human brain needs healthy proteins for brain cells to function and function properly. There are some proteins that we get from our diet and other proteins that are produced inside our body, such as the tau protein. Tau proteins are the connecting parts that hold the brain cells together. Imagine the brain is a city of Lego, with thousands of large buildings, each representing a brain cell. If a head injury occurs while playing sports, it disrupts the brain cell structures, like an earthquake causing Lego buildings to fall."
"I live in a house. It protects us from the rain, the wind and the sun. We have cups in our house. We use them to drink water, tea, juice and smoothies. We have flowers in our garden. They are nice and smell good too. My brother and I ride our bikes. We have fun doing this. If I had a horse, I would ride it to my castle. I love my cat! I give it cat food. If I had a turtle, I would feed it with lettuce. I see trucks on the road near my house. Trucks carry different things. I am a super hero. I have rainbow powers! I love the bright rainbow colors! I can get into a submarine. I can see aquatic animals. I can change shape. I can move easily. I can get into a mouse's house to visit."
"Calcium is present in most foods, including dairy products, such as milk and cheese, and is often present in small fish and vegetables. Calcium has long been known to be beneficial to the strength of our bones. Furthermore, scientists have discovered that calcium also plays an important role in the heart. The heart beats more than 2 billion times during the life of an average person to circulate blood, which is necessary to provide energy to each part of the body. The heart consists, among other things, of 3 billion heart muscle cells that tighten together (""contract"") during each heartbeat and together are responsible for the pumping function of the heart. To ensure that each cell contracts at the right time, the heart uses an electrical signal that moves from cell to cell, like a wave in a stage, where the activity of a person activates his neighbour."
"Although sometimes we cannot taste the difference between artificial and real sugars (although they are really very different), our brains and bodies can react to differences. Our bodies can sometimes even detect very small differences between the types of sugars and respond differently to each. Artificial sweeteners are highly concentrated, which means that for the same physical quantity, they can be between 200 to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar! Even though artificial sugars are softer than real sugars, they are almost calories-free. In some studies, scientists have even found that people prefer the taste of artificial sugars to real sugars. However, there is also evidence to suggest that there is greater brain activation in response to real sugar than saccharin (common artificial sugar), and this effect is particularly strong when people are hungry. Our brains and bodies have different responses to artificial sweeteners and sugars because these substances are different from each other in terms of microscopic molecules."
"""Hey, I'm Ashley,"" said a black-haired girl in the locker next to her by removing her backpack from her shoulders. ""Are you new here?"" Yes, Nothukula meant. But not only at Freedman High School, she was also new in the country. She had arrived in the summer of Zimbabwe. ""Can you speak English?"" Ashley asked. Nothukula looked at her. It wasn't that she didn't understand English. They had spoken it at the home back to school, and then there were the American soap operas she liked to watch. ""Are you new?"" Ashley spoke loud and slow, as Nothukula had difficulty hearing. She was still standing, looking at Nothukula, as if she were tapping the glass of a fish tank, waiting for any reaction."
"Intel Core is the name of a family of 32-bit dual-core microprocessors. It was manufactured by Intel's technology company. Intel Core processors are based on Pentium M technology. These processors are more advanced than Intel P6 processors. This architecture, or how to build a processor, is now replaced by Core 2 micro architecture. In the Core family, there are two groups: the Duo (with two cores) and Solo (Duo with a deactivated core). Solo line replaced the Pentium M processor a core. September 2006 and January 4, 2008 were times when many Core processors stopped selling. Yonah is a company name for the first generation of Intel microprocessors for mobile computers. Core Duo was released on January 5, 2006. It was the first Intel processor to be used in Apple Inc. Macintosh computers. Yonah does not have a 64-bit function."
"Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are most often caused by a stroke to the head as a result of being attacked during a sport, being involved in a car accident, or being hit with a hard object.TBIs can go from mild to severe, with some people returning quickly to school sports and others suffering from permanent brain damage.The consequences of BITs are considered an invisible disability because they can occur in everyday life, but the person does not seem to have a problem outside, as there is no need for a wheelchair, walker or crutch. For example, someone recovering from BITs may be faced with subtle changes in mood, vision and sensations in the legs."
"Before we dive into the discussion of brain damage, we want to introduce something that scientists call the Monroe-Kellie Doctrine, which is important to understand how traumatic brain damage (TBI) occurs. Think of your skull as a suitcase. If you pack for a trip, you can only fit into a number of articles. So, if you wrap too many clothes, you wouldn't be able to pack other things, like your favorite book. The Monroe-Kellie Doctrine states that there is a limited amount of space in the skull to hold all the cells that make up the brain tissue, the blood that provides oxygen to the tissue, and a special type of fluid that cushions the brain, called cerebrospinal fluid. So, because space is limited, if there is an increase in one of these three things, one or the other will have to decrease."
"Animals and humans eat food and breathe oxygen to create energy and breathe a gas called carbon dioxide. When we run, we breathe and breathe much faster. Plants change the energy they receive from carbon dioxide taken through their leaves from sunlight to oxygen. Living things respond to the outside world. We call this sensitivity. Humans make fires when they are cold. Plants fade when they do not receive water. Elephants swim in rivers when they are hot. Living things have babies to survive. Fish, frogs and birds lay eggs. Plants and trees produce seeds to make new plants and trees. Humans have babies."
"During the Second World War, new technologies were developed to enable ships to accurately measure the depths of water by navigating through the oceans. These are single beam echo sounders, instruments that could be attached to the hulls of ships. An echo-sun works by sending a sound signal, or ""ping"", in the water. This its journey through the water until it reaches the bottom of the sea. When it reaches the bottom of the sea, it bounces and reflects to the ship, where the echo-sun records the reflected signal. Thus, the name ""echo-sun"" tells you in fact how it works—it sends a ""sound"" (sun) and listens to the reflected sound, or ""echo""."
"Sometimes scientists want to go beyond the description of simple calculations such as mean heights or age in their populations, to understand the aspects of their populations that are more complex. Let's say that we're not only interested in seeing how many sleep students get, but we want to know how many test scores will decrease after losing a few hours of sleep. Effect sizes are values that estimate the magnitude of a phenomenon, or the extent to which a variable (such as sleep hours) affects another variable (such as test scores). For example, if getting only 3 hours of sleep decreases your test score by a few points compared to when you get 9 hours of sleep, you could not ""lose sleep"" about losing sleep. Although there is a difference in the score, it's not a big difference. However, if after losing 6 hours of sleep, you drop many points on a test, which could have a major impact on your score."
"If you become immunocompromised, that is, if you have a weak immune system, you will not be able to protect yourself against defective microbes. Most fungi only infect immunocompromised people. Fungi also likes growth on plastics and other materials! These surfaces allow fungi to form very powerful biofilms, which are communities of fungi living under a protective shield that prevents the immune system from attacking it and also prevents antifungals from killing fungal cells that live inside the body — think of the shield that protects Wakanda in the films Black Panther and Infinity War. When mushrooms form these biofilms, the immune system and medicines cannot penetrate the shield! Fungi can also leave the biofilm and move to other parts of the body to start a new infection. Imagine a fungus living in a biofilm that grows inside the catheter (tube IV) in someone's vein."
"ChAOS scientists are trying to find answers to such questions as: how will animals and micro-organisms living on the seabed respond to changes in ocean processes and sea ice? Will the decline in sea ice increase the supply of food to bottom ecosystems? How will bottom organisms change the way they recycle nutrients and carbon between the seabed and the ocean? And how will the amount of carbon stored in bottom sediments change as global climate change continues? The Arctic is a very remote and hostile area, in which few people will venture."
"While the parasitic plant has no eyes, it has specialized proteins called phytochromes that allow it to ""see"" different types of light, and to determine if it is in full sun or shaded conditions. This helps the parasite to prepare for contact and invasion of the host. Finally, the parasite will make contact with a host plant and the experience will ""touch"". Many plants respond to the touch. For most plants, however, the touch is associated with the danger. Touching it could indicate to a plant that insects land on its leaves and try to eat them. In this case, the plants use it to stop growth and instead spend their valuable energy resources in defense. These plants make a range of toxic chemicals that will prevent insects from feeding on them. Some plants also use contact to trigger a strengthening of the cell walls of the leaves, making it harder for insects to eat."
"Likewise, galaxies are just a group of stars joined together. Now, a galaxy is not a phone screen, but it behaves in the same way. When galaxies are close to us, we see bigger bumps coming from this galaxy because of the way the stars of galaxies are organized. Just like a screen, when galaxies are farther away, all these stars mix, and the galaxy will be really smooth, similar to how pixels on a screen mix when you sit there. When we know the size of bumps, because of the way stars are organized in a galaxy, it helps astronomers to determine how many stars this galaxy has."
"For example, when we say that alpha power decreases when someone is awake, it would mean that the power is lower than that of the sleeping person. Another example: if alpha power decreases when we see someone suffering, it would mean that alpha power is lower than that of someone who does not suffer. In this example, the brain's response to the person who does not suffer would be the basis. Previous studies have shown that the decrease and increase of alpha power both have different functions. However, scientists have worked on determining the exact meaning of these alpha power changes. Thus, looking at alpha rhythm is informative to better understand how the brain works in different contexts. By seeing someone suffering, the brain can react by increasing alpha power (red circle) or decreasing alpha power (blue circle). But when the other is not in pain, the brain does not respond with either of the two types of activation."
"Most fish listen to their environment and many fish produce sounds for communication. Fish can use the sound to communicate with bench members, to tell rivals how strong they are and to tell potential mates that they want to mate. Unfortunately, a lot of noise that humans make under water has frequencies similar to fish songs. To understand how noise affects fish, we studied a sound-producing fish, the painted goby (Pomatoschis pictus). Painted gobe males sing and dance to attract females into their nests, but females generally pay more attention to male singing than to male dance movements when choosing a mate. For females, it is particularly important to choose a healthy and strong male. These males will likely have healthy and strong children and will also take care of their offspring."
"In places where temperatures vary from season to season, winter is the coldest part of the year. During winter, many animals significantly reduce their activity, often finding burrows or other retreats to stay until spring. However, these retreats are generally not the same retreats in which they were born or hatched. An exception is turtles. Some adult turtles wait for winter cold under water in ponds or lakes that can freeze. Overwintering under water can be a problem for young turtles, because it is difficult for them to cope with very low oxygen levels (water is <1% oxygen, while air is ~21% oxygen)."
"We know that these motor representations are stored in the brain. But where in the brain? One of the best ways to answer this question is to study patients with brain lesions. Previous studies have shown that motor representations for familiar movements, such as brushing teeth, are located in an area of the brain called left parietal lobe. Parietal lobes are located on the sides of our brain. They treat the sensations of our body, such as touching, motion, pain and temperature. They are also important for creating and storing motor memories, as well as other things that we do not discuss in this document. The motor adaptation is the term we use to learn a new motion skill. The motor adaptation was found to be impaired in two patients with parietal lobe lesions. One patient had damage to the parietal lobes on both sides of the brain and the other had damage to the left parietal lobe. However, because a patient with right parietal damage has not been examined any more important than the right lobe."
"Some genes that control our internal clocks produce proteins called ""activators"" and others produce proteins called ""suppressors"". Activators are proteins that turn on a gene, while suppressors are proteins that turn off a gene. In our daily internal clocks, we need two activators to bind together to turn on a gene. This gene is usually lit in the morning. Once this gene is lit, many different proteins are made, including the two suppressors. When there are many suppressor proteins that are manufactured, we generally feel energetic and lively! Throughout the day, the concentration of these suppressors increases in our body. In the evening, enough suppressor proteins are made to block the activators and extinguish the gene. As you sleep, the suppressors in the blood stream break."
"As an adult, I could learn new actions by taking a dance class or trying a sport I've never done before. Learning new actions is not unusual, but for most people, their daily actions are not so different from what they've done in the past. On the other hand, babies constantly learn new things. They discover new things, learn to move new ways and play with new toys. You probably don't remember, but when you were a baby, you started to move your hands and arms, but don't have much control over how you've reached new toys and played with them."
"Humans and other monkeys share an ancestor, which means that if you follow the branches of generations of relatives of humans and other monkeys back far enough, you arrive at the same animal (our shared ancestor). Humans are more like chimpanzees and bonobos than they are like other monkeys, so they are closer to the tree of life. The three species – humans, chimpanzees and bonobos – share an ancestor. Humans have also become a different species from bonobos and chimpanzees 5-7 million years ago. Bonobos and chimpanzees have continued to become what they are today even after humans branched from them. Chimpanzees and bonobos have also changed for millions of years, but in their own way. We can study the behavior of animals that are alive now to learn the probable behavior of their ancestors."
"Autistic people have talked about camouflage for a while, but doctors and researchers still don't know very well about it. No one knows whether camouflage can help people or whether it really causes autistic problems. Researchers have begun to learn more about camouflage by asking autistic people about their camouflage or masking experiences, or to hide aspects of yourself or pretending to be like someone else. For example, a person can mask his autism by pretending to join a game even if they don't understand the rules. Autistic people have said that they camouflage their autism because they want to make friends and form connections with people, and because camouflage can be helpful to them. Some people can camouflage their autism when they are at school or at work, so people don't treat them differently and they can focus on what they have to do."
"A passive mechanical hand has fingers that are moving with the help of the other hand or the environment. This means that a mechanical hand can be used to hold something. The first passive mechanical hand was developed and used by the German knight Gottfried ""Götz"" von Berlichingen in the 16th century. Active prostheses allow the user to grasp objects, using specific movements of the body without the help of another hand. There are two types of active prostheses: body motor prostheses and external motor prostheses. Body motor prostheses, invented in the 19th century, are usually attached to the body with a harness. The hands or hooks at the end are opened and closed by movements of the body, such as the stretching of the arm. These prostheses are made of plastic, metal and fabric for the straps of the harness. Active prostheses with an external motor are widely used since the 1960s."
"When two animals of the same species mate, their offspring get 50% of their genes from each parent. This is what makes you look like a mixture of your parents. Hybrids are crosses between two different species, so they contain 50% of the genes of each parent species. A famous hybrid is the mule, a cross between a donkey and a horse. Fifty percent of the genes of a mule come from a horse and 50% from a donkey. Because of this mixture, mules have characteristics of each mother species and are strong, such as donkeys, as well as intelligent, like horses. Farmers produce mules because this combination makes mules excellent for transporting supplies. Hybridization to combine the desirable aspects of each mother species is very beneficial to humans, and hybrids are often used in agriculture."
"The plants are exposed to attackers above the ground, and they also face difficulties below the ground. The area surrounding the roots of a plant is its own small community called the rhizosphere, and it is not an empty neighborhood! The soil around the roots is full of micro-organisms. Of these microorganisms, there are some that establish donating and taking relationships with the roots of the plants. Such a group of organisms of soil origin is called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which we abbreviated as AMF. How could such a community in the rhizosphere help its plant host? Well, you are free to move to take a nutritious snack or go to the doctor to get prescriptions when you feel sick. Plants can't walk, so they depend on their roots to look for water and nutrients. Roots are limited in length, of course, so plants are looking for other sources of help, including AMF."
"Imagine walking in a park full of brightly coloured flowers and some of their greatest admirers, bees. Suddenly, you hear the buzz of a bee very close to your ear. Without even thinking about it, your muscles are tense, and you stop dying in your tracks. You find yourself frozen, hoping the bee ignores you and buzzes. What just happened? Well, one of the most important tasks of your brain is to keep you safe. Somewhere in your past, you learned two things: First, bees can sting! And second, bees are buzzing. So, when your ears piercing the ringing bee sound, the alarm bells went off in your brain. Your brain responded by telling your muscles to freeze so that the bee can just stuff you. And you don't even have to think about it... pretty cool! Now imagine something just a little different."
"A local network (LAN) is a computer network in a small area such as a home, office or school. Many computers can be connected to share information and Internet connections. Most LANs use Ethernet to connect. LAN topologies tell you how network devices are organized. Five common LAN topologies exist: bus, ring, star, tree and mesh. These topologies are logical architectures. This means that they tell you the directions that signals go between devices, but that the real cables that connect devices are not connected in the same way. For example, the logical topologies of buses and rings are usually organized physically as a star. A topology of buses means that the signal is placed on the medium and each device of the bus receives the signal. If more than one device tries to send a signal at the same time, they can interfere with each other."
"You've probably heard about bacteria and viruses that cause human diseases, and you may know how humans fight bacteria with antibiotics and how we prevent infections with bacteria and viruses using vaccines. But bacteria and viruses have also been fighting for a long time, and studying how they fight has taught us a lot about how organisms change over time and has also led to the discovery of an extremely exciting research tool. This battle between bacteria and viruses is about the ability to reproduce. Bacteria and viruses reproduce by making identical copies of themselves, and the instructions for doing so are stored in their DNA. DNA is a long molecule that is built from a combination of four smaller molecules: adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine (A, T, G and C to summarize)."
"Before corals whiten up, they don't show many other signs of stressed feelings. So, if we want to understand the health of a coral, we need to study its cells. Inside the cells, we have a lot of information, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. These molecules can help us find clues about the communication between coral and algae. But these molecules can also teach us how to know when corals are stressed. When an organism is stressed, each cell of its body will react. Everything will do its best to survive! In response to stress, the cell will use its DNA to make RNA, so that it can then make proteins that will fight stress. If an organism has already been stressed, it can respond to stress faster and better. Think about it like visiting a city: the first time you visit, you will need a map to find your hotel. The more often you visit the city, the less you will need the map because you will remember it, and you will come back to the hotel faster."
"When rainforests are destroyed, many species cannot survive in these areas and can disappear completely. Each species plays its own role within the ecosystem in which it lives. Each species consumes certain resources and is in turn eaten by other organisms higher in the food chain. All organisms in an ecosystem perform work that keeps ecosystems functioning – for example, by pollinating plants, helping dead organic matter (dead plants and animals) to decompose, or by feeding on other animals. Scientists call these processes ""ecosystem functions."" We don't know all species on earth and we certainly don't know what they are doing. But we know that if we lose species, we risk losing the functions they perform."
"Depression is the most common mental illness. Eighty-four per cent of the world's population suffers from depression. It is an alarming number of 322 million people, about the total population of the United States! For most people, depression begins when they are young, before they are 30 years old, and as depression often lasts for a long time, many people suffer for a large part of their lives. People with depression experience prolonged periods of feeling very sad and/or lose the ability to feel pleasure."
"It is estimated worldwide that marine herbs cover between 0.15 and 4.6 million square kilometres, an area ten times larger than the Red Sea. The Red Sea itself is home to 12 of the 60 species of marine grass worldwide, and together these marine herbs form an area that extends over 100,000 square kilometres, similar to the total size of Portugal. The grasslands of marine grasses, with their leaves extending to the surface of sea water, slows down the marine currents that transport sediments and other particles and allow these sediments to be deposited among the roots and leaves of marine grass. In doing so, marine herbs contribute to the formation of new layers of sediment above the oldest."
"As early as 1600 B.C., the Meso-American peoples of Mexico and Central America used liquid rubber for medicines, rituals and painting. It was only at the conquest of America that the use of rubber reached the western world. Christopher Columbus was responsible for finding rubber in the early 1490s. The natives of Haiti played football with a rubber ball, and later, in 1615, Fray Juan de Torquemada wrote about the indigenous and Spanish settlers of South America wearing shoes, clothing and hats made by soaking fabric in latex, making these articles stronger and waterproof. But rubber had some problems: it became sticky in response to the warm weather and it hardened and cracked with cold. A century later, in 1734, Charles Marie de la Condamine went to South America on a trip."
"One of the many benefits of using zebra fish to study fear is that, like other similar fish, they produce a special warning substance in their skin when they are injured. This substance is produced by cells called club cells, and the purpose of the substance is to report to other school members that a fish has been injured. When the skin of a fish is damaged by a predator, for example, the alarm substance is released, and other fish can smell. The ""danger smell"" causes other fish to be more cautious and behave as if they were afraid. When they feel this alarm substance, the other zebra fish swim in tight groups to increase protection."
"Until a fateful day when everything changed. There was a great explosion in the sky, a great bang. The Moon and the Sun were separated from each other. Separated from each other at once and in time. They could no longer see each other. They were both devastated and felt incomplete. They were both sad. They wanted the love of the other. Their love was so strong that it transcended through time and space. But everything was not lost that something was going to happen, something that would change everything. Something that would change their destiny. Suddenly there was a force of extraction that made them come closer from time to time. Finally the sun and the moon would be together during a process called Solar Eclipse. Finally, they were together, and they were very happy. It was not like before, but it didn't matter."
"Previous arthropods may seem quite harmless or, at worst, we may think they are parasites because they are boring. But spiders tend to create a lot of fear in people. This is due to the fact that almost all spiders are poisonous, and some have enough hooks to bite humans. However, with the exception of a few species, most spiders are harmless, avoid humans and are beneficial as predators of parasites and parasites. This is good news, because in our study we found that two families of spiders, cobweb spiders and cave spiders were found in 100 and 84% of the houses, respectively. In fact, we found evidence of cobweb spiders in 65% of the pieces sampled."
"For example, predation is a type of interaction between an organism (a predator) that eats another organism (the prey) – it's good for the predator but very bad for prey! Different species of ants can eat a lot of different things, and some ants are important predators. Predators often eat other insects such as termites and caterpillars, while other ants eat only plants or fungi. Megaponous ants have only one food – termites – and these ants organize huge hunts in which working ants infiltrate into termites colonies, capture as many termites as they can carry, and bring termites back to ant nest to feed their larvae."
"Metabolism is the name given to the chemical reactions that keep us alive. It occurs in the cells of living organisms. The reactions catalyzed by enzymes allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures and respond to their environments. The word ""metabolism"" can also refer to the digestion and transport of substances in and between different cells. Metabolism is usually divided into two categories. Catabolism breaks down organic matter and collects energy through cellular respiration. Anabolism uses energy to build molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, or cycles, such as the Krebs cycle. A chemical is transformed by a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes. The metabolic system of an organism determines which substances it finds nutritious and which are toxic. For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, but this gas is toxic to animals."
"My name is Comma. I help you take a break between thoughts, and I also separate the items from a list. I like exercise, reading and playing. Do you want to talk to me about the things you like to do? Curiosity is my superpower! My mission is to ask questions and find answers! Please call me Question Mark, would you? I am Semicolon; I am a guard on Sentence Street. I am a pause longer than a comma, but I am not a complete stop. I sometimes play Cupid by helping solitary clauses connect and become friends instead of strangers. I can also separate the items in a long list to avoid confusion. When a letter or two is missing from a word, I will stand for the letters. I also show possession or something belongs to someone. Call me Apostrophe."
"The sun rises in the morning, on the east side. I hear the dick crow at dawn. The sun moves on Terfa's compound before the morning meal. I feel the aroma of beer and akpupa following the sun at my window. The sun goes behind a tree at school during lunch. Then it arrives in a puddle in the middle of the playground. The sun stands above my head. My shadow stands next to me. I play the game of shadow with my friends. My shadow grows, then smaller. We run after it. My shadow grows longer, then shorter. We run after it. I am standing up, my friends stand up. We see our shadows wandering away. We grow tired and go back to class. After school, we go home. The sun is yawning. I see the sun sinking slowly to the west. I see my shadow on a wall. It's time to go to bed. The sun goes down behind the clouds. I go home to sleep in my bed."
"We have fun with the kids who come to the shop with their parents. Sometimes, the mother has to act as a referee and help the customers. I think she has superpowers! When we get too noisy, mom says, ""Now sit down and watch TV."" She always adds, ""But only for 30 minutes, while we're taking a break!"" If we don't have school work, sometimes the mother asks me or my older sister to help her. I'm not always ready to help. But I do it because I know she's working so hard."
"While she was thinking about her rainbow quest, Yana saw a green frog jump into the bushes. She couldn't resist, she jumped with the frog for a while. Then, looking at the sky, she said goodbye to the frog. Yana went on her way looking for the end of the rainbow. She started thinking about the colors of the rainbow. In a flash, the red first came to mind. She recalled the day her family almost had a bad accident because a driver didn't stop at a red light. Yana was grateful because no one was seriously injured, although they all had cuts and bruises."
"Yuadoo is afraid of the darkness. Everyone is afraid sometimes. But Yuadoo can ask for help. Chidubem is worried about his school work. He can tell his teacher. He can ask for help. Lushan plays around! It's good to be stupid sometimes. Eruro feels sad. It's good to cry. Emotions come and go. The Ayator bursts of happiness. He is happy. Emotions come and go. Hadiza gets bored. She has to find something to do. Ayo is angry. He is frustrated. Changing is a difficult feeling. Labake is excited. What is the cause of her excitement? Mother made her favorite food. Zege felt asleep. He was very tired. ""But wait, it's's' Sleepy' an emotion?"" asks Efe. Efe is confused! Can you answer her question? Tega feels surprised and shocked. He has heard gossip!"
"Georges Oedès was in his 20s when he visited the collection of the Near East in the Louvre, the famous museum of Paris near where he lived. He was intrigued by an ancient Babylonian inscription in an exhibition. This first experience led him to study the ancient languages and spend his life discovering the ancient mysteries contained in the inscriptions of South-East Asia. Oedès had an intriguing theory. He believed that the figures had originated from civilizations throughout Asia that shared a common culture based on the religions of Buddhism or Hinduism. Other scholars at the time assumed that figures had to come from Greece or Arabia, but oedès felt that this belief did not appreciate the intellectual evolution of the East. At this stage, oedès had no proof of his theory."
"If the ice is disturbed during growth, it forms irregularities, which means that it will not be as clear, because not all molecules have been well organized that they have frozen. There may be layers that are not transparent and the surface may be less smooth. In the sea, there are almost always disturbances that occur during the formation of the ice, because there are almost always waves. When the ice forms in the sea, it therefore seems different from the ice formed in your freezer, and the sea ice forms through several different stages. First, there is a stage where the water is very cold but still liquid. Then there is an area where the ice has begun to form small crystals in the shape of needles that come together to form ice."
"Once upon a time, there was a family that owned a large farm. They had a lot of peanuts and corn on their farm. All the four-legged animals went to the farm to eat the crops of this family. But the rabbit was very intelligent. He would spot the owners as they came to the farm. The rabbit shouted, ""Robbers! Robbers!"" as soon as he saw the farmers, and all the animals fled. Over time, the family realized that their crops were eaten. They took out a big doll to scare the animals and protect the farm. They put glue on the doll's body. The next day, the animals went to the farm and saw the doll. They decided not to come back because they thought the doll would catch them. The doll scared all the animals, except the rabbit."
"There was a girl named Ayanda. Ayanda was the only child of her parents. Her mother and her father wanted to separate. Ayanda decided to flee from her home. She went into the forest because she didn't know where to go. A wolf in the forest was chasing Ayanda, and she climbed a tree. The wolf tried to bite her, so she climbed higher. At the top of the tree, Ayanda saw the beautiful sun. She fell in love with the sun and decided to stay in the forest. Ayanda climbed the tree every day to talk to the sun. The sun became her family. One day, Ayanda saw a man under the tree. The man was her father. Ayanda came down from the tree and her father explained why he was there."
"Mythology can also refer to the study of such myths. A myth is a story that is not true. The definition of the word myth is still subject to debate. Myths can be very old, or new (e.g. urban myths). There may be no records or other evidence that they have occurred, but at least some parts of the myths may be true. We know about them that older people tell them to young people. Some myths may have started as ""real"" stories but as people have said and repasted them, they may have changed some parts, so they are less ""true."" They may have changed them by mistake, or make them more interesting. All cultures have myths. Stories about Greek and Roman gods and goddesses are myths. Many people once believed in animals and mythological gods. These animals or gods may have control or power over part of human or natural life."
"The tropical ocean contains very little food or nutrients. Like life in a desert, life in the tropical ocean is difficult for all organisms. However, coral reefs are colourful oasises full of life in the middle of this marine desert. How can millions of species call coral reefs their home? All the organisms that live there play their role in recycling the small amounts of food and nutrients available. Because nothing is ever really wasted, coral reefs can flourish in a marine desert that has little food. Although coral reefs existed on this planet long before dinosaurs, they are facing serious problems today."
"Nutrition provides the cells of an organism with food, but in a form that they can use. Organisms need food to keep their body in good condition. They also need food to be able to do certain things. Malnutrition can happen when a person does not eat the right amount of nutrients. They can get better by changing their diet to have the right amount of nutrients. Different organisms have different dietary needs, and they eat different things to meet these needs. Animals that do not eat meat, for example, will have to get some nutrients like proteins from other foods. A nutrition expert is called a dietician. Nutritionists are different because they do not need the government to recognize them as experts."
"Paleontology is the study of the fossils of living beings, and their phylogeny (evolutionary relationships). It depends on basic sciences such as zoology, botany and historical geology. The term paleobiology implies that the study will study the paleoecology of the groups in question. In paleozoology, the evolution of these phyla with fossil records is studied: see List of animal phyla. In paleobotany, fossil plants are studied. In historical geology, the formation, sequence and dating of the rock strata give information on past environments. A fossil is any type of life that is more than ten thousand years old and is preserved in any form that we can study today."
"A parliament is a type of legislature. The most famous parliament is probably that of the United Kingdom, which is sometimes called the ""mother of all parliaments."" The word ""parlement"" comes from the French word speaking, which means a speech. The Althing, the national parliament of Iceland, was founded earlier (930 AD), so it is the oldest legislature in the world that still exists. However, the Althing did not function as a legislature for four centuries, and its role as a primary legislature is modern. The Parliament of the United Kingdom is divided into three distinct parts, the House of Commons (the Lower House), the Lords (the Upper House) and the Monarch. The majority of the legislative power is concentrated in the House of Commons. It is composed of 650 members, who are elected by the people of the United Kingdom to represent them in the House of Commons."
"Algae are microscopic plants that live in water. Each drop of water normally contains hundreds of thousands of these tiny small plants. Algae are natural and important because they are the vegetables of the sea's food web. There are several thousand different types of algae. Algae use sunlight and CO2 to grow and they feed fish, crabs, oysters and other organisms. But some species of algae can be harmful or toxic. Just like some plants on earth, such as poisoned ivy, some algae can make chemicals that harm fish and people. When algae increase considerably in numbers, we say they bloom (such as flowers), and pests create a proliferation of harmful algae."
"What really happens when parts of the brain become active? Nervous cells called neurons in active parts of the brain communicate more with each other. Active parts of the brain require more oxygen to allow neurons to communicate. How do active parts of the brain get a new source of oxygen? Blood carries oxygen through blood vessels, into the brain. There is a protein in the blood called hemoglobin that holds on oxygen and transports it to places that need more energy. When hemoglobin is held on oxygen, it is called hemoglobin oxygen, and when hemoglobin does not hold oxygen, it is called deoxygenated hemoglobin. When an area of the brain is active, oxygenated hemoglobin begins to move the deoxygenated hemoglobin. When part of the brain is active, there is a hemodynamic response."
"We have complex systems for each function. For example, one brain network is responsible for the acquisition and management of data from our senses, another is responsible for the creation and management of our emotions, another is responsible for the movements, and another is responsible for the creation, management and prioritization of our thoughts. In OCD, the communication system between the parts of the brain, i.e. the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia, is disturbed and the brain makes errors in the processing and prioritization of information. The orbitofrontal cortex is responsible for the use of directional information to make decisions and anticipate the outcome of our life choices. In OCD, this region is hyperactivated and detects errors and dangers where there is nothing wrong."
"When someone is in a difficult situation, they can use a little help from their friends. Who has the most friends in Frozen? It's hard to say just by watching the film, but we can study another type of social network — the network of who is talking. This network is not exactly the same as a network of friendships, but it is much easier to determine with precision who is speaking in the film than to decide exactly who is friends with each other and how strong these friendships are. In this network of conversations, Anna speaks to nine people, so we will assume that she has nine friends. Mathematicians say that Anna is a node in this network, that she has a degree of nine, and that these nine friends are her neighbours. Similarly, Elsa has a degree of eight, because she has eight friends; and Kristoff has a degree of six."
"There was an old lady with a stomachache. A fairy passed by and stopped to ask why the old lady was crying. ""I have a terrible stomachache,"" she was crying. ""Can you help me?"" The fairy said, ""No, I can't help you. I'm Sibusiso, the evil fairy. I'm only doing bad things."" ""So, please, go away,"" said the woman. With a bad chamfer, Sibusiso disappeared. (It became invisible.) The old lady rubbed her stomach. Before long, another fairy came. This fairy, named Khumo, also asked what was wrong. ""My stomach is painful!"" moaned the old woman. Khumo replied, ""I can help! I'm going to do some medicine for you."" Invisible Sibusiso looked. He used her magic to send Khumo in the future. The old lady was surprised and looked around."
"The second step was to use characters separated by wood carving or moulding. This was done in the 11th century China and Korea. It did not really succeed, because of the structure of the Chinese written language, shared at the time by Korea, which had thousands of characters. As a result, the method was not significantly better than the copying by the scribes. Printing was reinvented in 15th century Europe. Development was slow until Johannes Gutenberg made several improvements. In the post-print century it became the main means of communication between people who wanted to record knowledge. With an alphabetical system of writing, printing was much more economical than copying, and allowed much more copies for readers. This revolution in information technology helped all aspects of life in Europe, at a time when Europe became the dominant region of the world."
"Radar is a machine that uses radio waves for echolocation to find objects such as planes, ships and rain. The basic parts of a radar are: The transmitter creates radio waves. The antenna directs the radio waves. The receiver measures the waves that are bounced by the object. In doing so, the radar can locate the object. Radar is used in different ways. It can measure the speed and number of cars on a road, the amount of water in the air, and many other things. Radar was first used in 1904 by Christian Hülsmeyer. It received a patent for radar (Reichspatent Nr. 165546). It became common during the Second World War. The word RADAR was created in 1942 as an acronym for radio detection and ranking. This acronym replaced the British initialism RDF (Radio Direction Finding)."
"The reptile is the common name of one of the main groups of terrestrial vertebrates. It is not so used by biologists, who use more precise terms. The name ""reptile"" comes from Latin and means ""one that crawls"". All species of living reptiles are blood-cold, have scalar skin, and lay cleidoic eggs. They excrete uric acid (instead of urea) and have a cloaca. A cloaca is a common opening for the anus, urinary tracts and reproductive canals. Reptiles also share an arrangement of the heart and major blood vessels that is different from that of mammals. Many large groups of reptiles are now extinct. Large marine reptiles of the mesozoic era, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and mosasures are extinct."
"If you have an Internet connection, you probably have a router somewhere where your computer sends data. It's the first router to which your computer will connect to access the Internet. It's also known as a default gateway (because it's your gateway to the Internet). By convention, the gateway has the lowest IP address (like a phone number for a computer) in the subnet (a group of addresses). Each time you make a connection (such as a connection to www.wikipedia.org), your computer searches for the IP address using the search service called DNS (Domain Name Service). Once the destination address has been found, your computer connects to your gateway router. The gateway then sends data to a router to your ISP (Internet Service Provider), this router can be said to be part of the Internet and connect to other routers until the data arrive at your destination."
"Methane is a gas that is produced naturally in all kinds of environments, and it comes from the degradation of organic materials (formerly living). Methane is effective in trapping heat and it also burns very easily. Thus, methane is one of the most important fuels for humans. In addition, methane in the atmosphere helps regulate the climate on Earth. However, the amount of methane in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily for 200 years, which concerns the scientific community. Surprisingly, recent studies have indicated that methane levels are regulated by tiny microbes. In this article, we encourage you to learn about the methane cycle, the microbes that manufacture and eat methane, and why more research is needed on this gas."
"The wildlife trade, which can be legal, and wildlife trafficking, which is illegal trade, includes thousands of species (and millions of individual organisms) that are traded each year. Wildlife trade is very diverse and includes species of plants, fungi, and all kinds of animals, such as reptiles, birds, mammals, amphibians, fish and insects. There are many reasons why species are traded. The most common reasons are that plants and animals traded are used for food, medicine, pets, or to create luxury items, such as souvenirs, jewellery, clothing or furniture."
"Responding to stress in the way described above is a very positive thing. In fact, it is essential. Without responding to stress, the T. Rex would probably eat us. But, when you think about it, how many times in most of our lives we are stressed because a T. Rex (or any predator, by the way) will eat us? We are much more likely to be stressed by ongoing non-physical worries. Social relations, performance at school or at work, the unknown to try something new; these are the things that are likely to stress us on a daily basis. These are also situations in which an increase in heart rate or more blood flow to your muscles are not at all useful. In these cases, known as chronic stress (because it lasts for a long time), the response to stress can actually be very bad for you."
"Many genes may undergo changes, called mutations, which, in some cases, may make a person more susceptible to certain diseases. Diseases caused by mutations in genes on chromosome X are called X-related diseases. Remember, males do not know XCI because they have only one chromosome X. So, if males have a gene responsible for the disease on their chromosome X, it will be active and more likely to cause the disease. However, XCI helps protect females from X-related diseases. Imagine a girl has a healthy copy of a gene on a chromosome X and a mutant copy of the same gene on her other chromosome X. If the chromosome X with mutant copy is extinguished due to XCI, then the chromosome X with healthy copy will remain active and will express the gene correctly. This does not mean that she would not be ill, but it will increase her chances of not getting the diseases related to the mutant gene."
"Even in good weather conditions, pull-out currents can travel off these canals very quickly, sometimes at speeds greater than 2 m (2.2 yards) a second, which is as fast as some Olympic swimmers! This means that even gentle pull-out currents can take swimmers of all abilities a long way off. A pull-out current can easily move someone the length of a football field in just 1 min. What makes these currents dangerous is that you don't feel anything, you just go with the flow. It's only when you realize that you're suddenly away from the beach safety that things get scary, and that's where most people start to panic."
"In the 1980s, scientists realized that these habitats supported an unusual type of primary production, fed not by sunlight and photosynthesis, but by the energy of reactions between chemicals found in hydrothermal fluid, such as sulphide, and oxygen present in seawater. Surprisingly, some monocellular basic microorganisms can use this energy to build the parts of their cells. Hydrothermal vents provided the first proof that this process, called chimosynthesis, could maintain as much life in an environment similar to that of deserts. But what about larger animals living in these environments? How do they get the energy they need to survive? Well, many of these animals acquire their energy by maintaining close relationships with different chemosynthetic organisms."
"A secure digital card (SD card) is a kind of memory card. Such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras. In 2008, different capacities between 4 megabytes and 32 gigabytes were created. The card has a rectangular design, but a edge is chipped. This means that cards cannot be inserted into cameras (or other devices) in the wrong way. There are different types of cards: Those labeled SD, with capacities up to 2 GB Those labeled SDHC, with capacities between 4 GB and 32 GB Those labeled SDXC, with capacities up to 2 TB (the most important is currently 512 GB or 200 GB for MicroSD). SD and SDHC are not compatible, but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards. The interface of SDHC and SDXC cards is the same, but SDXC uses a different file system."
"Seismology is the study of what is beneath the Earth's surface by measuring vibrations on the Earth's surface. Seismology is carried out by seismologists and geophysicists who use devices to capture vibrations called geophones, hydrophones or sismometers. Seismology can be passive, simply listen to vibrations caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity, or active, using small explosive loads to send vibrations into the ground. Seismic detectors are presented in two types, one that measures vibrations upstream and downstream, and the other that measures lateral vibrations. Both types use and arrange a magnet and a wire coil that converts vibrations into an electrical signal that can be stored in a computer for analysis. Seismologists can find the location of earthquakes by tracing vibrations received on a map."
"Ivan Pavlov was a physiologist studying the digestive system in dogs, when he noticed that dogs would start at drool (or ""salivat"") when ordinary things happened around the time the food was coming. Pavlov found that he could train dogs to drool following a particular signal, like the sound of a bell, by presenting the signal before giving dogs their food. Over time, dogs would start at drool when they heard the signal rather than when they received their food. This process is not limited to dogs. For example, if you go to an ice cream shop a lot and it smells like strawberries, you might eventually come to form a mental link between ice cream and the smell of strawberries. The smell of strawberries becomes a clue that could make you start salivating to the thought of ice cream. This process of forming mental links between environmental indices and something that is very motivating, like a food you like, is called classic conditioning."
"Each soil has different amounts of sand, silt and clay. The mixture of sand, silt and clay is the ""texture"" of the soil. It can also be said that the mixture has a ""texture of the soil"". A soil with a lot of sand is called a ""texture of the sandy soil"". A soil with a lot of silt is called a ""texture of the silent soil"". A soil with a lot of clay is called a ""texture of the clay soil"". Farmers like to grow food in the best soil. The best soil is half the sand and a bit of silt and a bit of clay. The organic material found in the soil is not counted in the texture of the soil. Only rocks are counted when we discover the texture of the soil. The texture of the soil is very important. Clay and humus are special parts of the soil. They help to keep water and plant food (plant nutrients) in the soil. Water and plant nutrients stick to clay and humus."
"In modern politics, a state is an association that has control over a geographical area or territory. States are considered to have three main elements: A territory A people Some institutions (which have the power to make rules). There are different forms of government a state can have, for example a republic or a monarchy. Sometimes states form their own country. Sometimes many states work together to form a country (such as the United States). Most states also have armed forces, civil service, law and police. The first states were only power groups. A group of farms working together or a group of factories working together could be ""states"" because people can control and protect them."
"Nearly 3.5 billion years ago, before humans, trees and even dinosaurs, the only living things on Earth were unique cells. Over the years, these cells were reproducing, dividing over and over again and filling the planet with many unique cells. They lived on earth and in the sea, but they remained really small for millions and millions of years. But all of a sudden, creatures made up of many cells began to appear. Today, we see these ""multicellular"" species all around us."
"The Romans called epilepsy sacred disease, thinking that the gods were talking to people during crises. In the Middle Ages, people believed that crises were caused by a demon inside the body that invisiblely ""captured"" the person. Hence the seizure of the name. Fear spread quickly and soon people believed that even breathing the same air as an epileptic patient could allow the demon to travel to other people. Therefore, people with seizures were isolated and restricted. Their ""physicians"" were priests who tried to send the demon. Not only were these treatments not useful, but they could also be dangerous for patients. To provide the right treatment, doctors needed to know the cause of epilepsy. In the Middle Ages, they did not know what we know now. Today, we know that crises occur in the brain."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common brain disorders in children. TBI often occurs because of a strong blow to the head to be hit by an object, to run into an object or to fall on the head. TBI can be very dangerous because it can seriously damage the brain, which is critical to controlling the body and personality, as well as speech, movement, and much more. Depending on which part of the brain is injured, there can be serious consequences. Therefore, it is important to be able to diagnose a BIT as soon as it occurs. When the brain is damaged, the consequences of the injury can be very serious. However, studying the brain is difficult, because the brain is locked in the skull."
"The Sumerians made their clothes using the natural resources available to them. The clothes were made of wool or linen that the Sumerians could raise and harvest. As the clothes were thick or coarse compared to the season in which they were worn. Heavy clothes were worn in winter, lighter clothes in summer. The men were naked and wore skirt-shaped clothes that were attached to the waist. The women usually wore dresses that covered them with their shoulders at their ankles. The right arm and shoulder were discovered. The men were either shaved or had long hair and beards. The women wore their hair long, but they weared them and wrapped them around their heads. When the guests entertained, the women placed hairstyles in their hair. Although the rich and poor Sumerians wore the same style of clothing, the richer Sumerians wore clothes made of expensive and luxurious materials."
"At a normal temperature like 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 °C), the speed required for something to move at a speed faster than sound is about 344 m/s, 1,129 ft/s, 770 mph or 1,238 km/h. Speeds faster than 5 times the speed of sound are sometimes called hypersonic. Speeds where only parts of the air around an object (such as the propeller) reach supersonic speeds are called transonic (normally somewhere between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2). It can be very difficult to reach supersonic speeds, because the drag increases much near these speeds."
"Primates, like humans, are mammals. About ten to twelve million years ago, the lineage of ancestral primates was divided through the speciation of a common ancestor into two large groups. These two lines evolved separately to become the variety of species that we see today. The members of a group were the first version of what we know today as the great monkeys (gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos in Africa, orangutans in Asia); that is, the great modern monkeys have evolved from this ancestral group. They have mostly remained in the forest with a tree-like way of life, which means that they live in trees. The great monkeys are also quadruped, which means that they move around four legs on the ground. The other group has evolved in a different way. They have become terrestrial, which means that they live on land and not in trees."
"The viscosity is a physical property of the fluids. It shows a resistance to flow. In a simple example, the water has a low viscosity, because it is ""fine"". The syrup or tar, on the other hand, has a high viscosity, because it is ""thick"". One way to test the viscosity is the speed at which the substance descends from a slope. The syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, while the water would be much faster. There are two types of viscosity: the dynamic viscosity, measured in paschal seconds, and the kinematic viscosity, measured in metres per second squared. Viscosity is used to predict when volcanoes burst. When the lava comes out very thickly (viscous), it is more likely to burst violently."
"Before that, the telephone used a dedicated line, which was assigned to a call, at the time of this call. This was known as RTPC (or ""public switched telephone network""). The use of VOIP will reduce costs, as the ""dedicated line"" for telephony (and fax) is no longer required. There are a number of technical problems that need to be solved in the first place, although: The transmission of voice data requires service guarantees (mainly in the form of ""sharing"" and ""response time""). Not having this will result in a signal loss (or in ""hiccups"") Most telephone networks offer the possibility of operating a telephone, even when power is lost in the area. This is done so that emergency calls can still be made. VOIP does not usually provide this possibility. LAN is now used both for voice and data and becomes a failure point."
"A wind turbine is a rotating machine that transfers the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy. If mechanical energy is used directly by the machines, such as pumping water, cutting wood or grinding stones, the machine is called wind turbine. If the mechanical energy is instead converted into electricity, the machine can be called a wind turbine generator (WTG), a wind energy unit (WPU), a wind energy converter (WEC) or an aerogenator. Wind turbine blades are turned by the wind. This slowly rotates a shaft with a high torque of about 10-20 rpm. The shaft goes in a gearbox of about 1:50, even if some wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more. Some wind turbines may have no gearbox and a ratio of 1:1. The gearbox transforms the generator faster, at about 1000 rpm, to a low torque. The generator creates electricity."
"Today, all humans on Earth belong to the same group, which we generally call ""modern humans."" But until about 30,000 years ago, other human groups existed in parallel with us. The most well-known are the Neanderthals. Neanderthals have lived tens of thousands of years in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. At the same time, modern humans have evolved in Africa. Both groups met only when modern humans started to leave Africa and spread over other continents. The nature of encounters between the two human groups is still a mystery, but the final result is well known: we are still around, while the Neanderthals have disappeared a long time ago. The Neanderthals were generally very similar to us, but still had differences. For example, they had a lower and slightly elongated skull, a slightly larger brain, a protuberous face, larger teeth and larger bones, indicating that they were stronger than us."
"Wayan lived in a small village near the sea. People believed that when you died, you returned to the sea. The sea is a special place where the ancestors live. Wayan's father and grandfather were fishermen. Most of the men in the village were fishermen, and it was always this way. Every morning at sunrise, the men went fishing in jukung boats. Every night at sunset, they returned with their boats full of fish. Wayan learned to fish as everything changed for the fishermen. There were fewer fish, and they were always small. Sometimes, the boats returned empty, even if they were at sea all day. The beaches also changed. They were still polluted, with plastic waste thrown on the sand. When the tide came out, he washed the plastic into the sea. Gradually, the people of the village began to get sick."
"Abula stole her mother's money to buy candy. Even when she hid her money, he found it and took it. After eating all her candy, Abula played with her friends. After a while, Abula stopped going to school. He stayed out playing all day, only returning home at night. Abula's mother noticed this and became worried. ""Our son is not doing well. I don't think he's going to school. He also steals money from me,"" said Abula's mother. He said to his wife, ""Next time, hide the money in a book. He never even opens a book, so the money will be safe there."" The next day, Abula looked for his mother's money. He looked everywhere but he didn't find anything. He decided to go to the nearest market to find money."
"Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash) is a rich Internet application distributed by Adobe Systems. Adobe Flash and Adobe Flash Player are used to create and display animated content that can be placed on web pages. Adobe Flash is commonly used on the Internet by web browsers. Flash was created by FutureWave (a multimedia company) in 1995. Then it was called ""FutureSplash Animator"" (which was actually Flash 1.0). FutureWave with Flash were quickly purchased by Macromedia around 1997, which in December 2005 was again purchased by Adobe Systems. From Flash 2 to 8 it was called ""Macromedia Flash"", now it is called ""Adobe Flash"". In 2012, Adobe ceased the Solaris version of Flash Player, and made the Linux version only for Google Chrome. The Linux version for Firefox will continue to receive security updates. The Android version has been removed from Google Play, but it can still be downloaded from Adobe website. The Android version is not officially supported on Android beyond 4.0, but it has been reported to work with versions 4.1 and 4.2."
"However, after having a baby, if a mother keeps the extra weight she gained during pregnancy, it can be harmful to her health in the long term. This study tested whether a weight loss program on the Internet could help mothers lose weight after having had a baby. We worked with WIC, which is a program that gives low-income families food and support. Half of the women in the study received WIC regularly and half received WIC plus a weight loss program on the Internet. We found that the Internet program helped mothers lose five pounds more than regular WIC, and it also helped more mothers to get back to weight than they were before pregnancy. WIC serves half of all American mothers; the WIC weight loss program on the Internet could help many women get closer to the weight they were before pregnancy and avoid weight-related illnesses later in life."
"For example, when two individuals walk directly towards each other on a sidewalk, the person who moves to the left or the right first defines the direction of movement for the second person. This is something that most of us have experienced in everyday life. Of course, most of us have also experienced what happens if symmetry is not broken: a clumsy dance of the back and strength as you and the walker who approach move quickly to the left and right at the same time. In this situation, as in most cases of social (and individual) behaviour, symmetrical rupture is very important for an effective organization of behavior and performance; symmetrical break defines how individuals move together in harmony."
"The air we breathe is made up of many different chemical components. Some of these components are pollutants that are harmful to human health. Air pollutants come from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, agriculture and transportation. Transportation vehicles are powered by the combustion of fossil fuels, such as gasoline or diesel, to move from one place to another, and combustion of these fuels results in the release of gases and very small particles. These substances are known as ""pollution emissions."" Different types of transport can emit different amounts of air pollutants, which have an impact on local and regional air quality."
"In a particular year, the dry season was too long, and a drought hit hard. As a result, all the rivers dried, except the river of Blessings. All the animals were thirsty and calling for a meeting. Camel was the first to speak, ""As you know, we are very thirsty and all the rivers dried, except the river of Blessings. But that's far away. What are we doing?"" Cheval suggested, ""Some of us can go to the river of Blessings. We can drink and bring water for others."" Vache replied, ""It's too far. At the time we came back from the river, those who had stayed behind would have died."""
"As a result, the Amazon and its large rivers act as water vapour bombs, which put water into the atmosphere and form a dense layer of clouds that contain large amounts of water. These clouds flow with the winds, forming incredible flying rivers. Due to the high temperatures in the Amazon and the large amount of rain that falls around the equator, the Amazon has this enormous power of water exchange between the forest and the atmosphere. The Andean cordillera, 4,000 meters high to the west of the South American continent, acts as a barrier to the winds and clouds that cross the continent and the Atlantic Ocean."
"These labels were specially prepared by experts to give us their opinion on art objects. We thought that most people believe what is written on these labels, and we wanted to understand how powerful these opinions could be. So we put people in a brain scanner to measure their brain responses while they received different opinions on the same images. For this research, we used portrait paintings by the famous Dutch artist Rembrandt. Sometimes we told our viewers that the portrait was a real Rembrandt and sometimes we told them that the portrait was a fake. When we analyzed the brain responses, the most interesting answers were found when people were informed that the paintings were false. Two parts of the brain, one involved in strategic planning (called frontopolar cortex) and the other involved in vision (called occipital cortex), seemed to work together when people thought that the paintings were false."
"Within each cell of our body is a long and fine molecule called DNA. DNA is your own personal instruction manual and it tells your body everything it needs to know! DNA determines your eye color, the tone of the skin, how much you are, and even if your muscles are better at sprinting or running a marathon. Just like a real instruction manual, DNA instructions are written in a series of letters. In DNA, there are only four letters – A, T, G, and C. These letters are combined to state the instruction for proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of cells. Your brain, your heart and all other organs are made of many different proteins. The DNA letters necessary to make a protein are referred to as a ""genus"". Can you guess how many genes a human being has? More than 20,000!"
"An antenna or antenna is a metal device designed to send or receive radio waves. Many electronic devices such as radio, television, radar, wireless LAN, cell phone and GPS need antennas to do their work. Antennas operate in both air and space. The word ""antenna"" comes from Guglielmo Marconi's test with wireless equipment in 1895. For the test, it used a 2.5-metre long antenna with a tent pole called ""central antenna"" in Italian. Thus, its antenna was simply called ""antenna."" After that, the word ""antenna"" became popular among people and had the meaning it has today. The antenna plural is either antennas or antennas (United States and Canada tend to use antennas more than other places)."
"You have probably realized that languages change over time. They change slowly and subtly, but you may have noticed some of these changes. Your parents can use ancient words that you and your friends would never use. For example, if you mean something is really good, you can say dope or phat. Instead, your parents can say great or mean... and your grandparents, groovy or hip! However, it's not only vocabulary that changes over time. All aspects of a language, sounds, grammar, how words and phrases are used during conversation, change over time. Have you ever read the original version of one of Shakespeare's plays? If you have, you've found a lot of strange words and phrases."
"Butterflies, as well as beetles, flies, butterflies and wasps, fall into the category of holomatabolic insects, meaning that butterflies pass through a complete metamorphosis, i.e., the transition of a larval animal, similar to a grub, to an adult animal with wings, large thin legs and large eyes. Butterflies have four different stages of life during development: embryonic stages (which take place inside the egg), larval stage (or caterpillar), pupal stage and adult stage. Eggs are placed on specific plant leaves and larvae hatching eggs and eat these leaves until they enter the pupal stage. The pupal stage is when most of the larval body tissues are dissolved and reformed to create adult butterflies that eventually emerge from the embryo."
"Confusion is not only an important step in learning at school, it is also important to learn who you are. Psychologists call this sense of who you are. Your identity may involve being part of groups like race, gender, subcultures. Identity is also made up of your values and goals. People define their identity in two stages. The first step is exploration, where you try different groups and values and see what's right. The next step is engagement, when you decide firmly about certain parts of your identity."
"Large memory is a software and hardware approach that facilitates the storage/extraction/processing of large data sets (terabytes and more). The term is close to big data and in some cases is a form of massive data processing architecture implemented in memory rather than in disks/storage. Different caches are one of the uses of large memory. Computer memory, i.e. RAM, works orders of magnitude faster than hard disks or even hard disks, which is usually due to a higher raw data rate from a tighter coupling of CPU and RAM chips (larger bus, CPU and RAM are usually installed on the same motherboard). The reference locality is another important feature for caches and fast access. The price of computer memory chips has decreased significantly since the late 2000s, starting in 2015 it is affordable to have 256 gigabytes of RAM on a server."
"A capacitor (also called a capacitor, which is the old term) is an electronic device that stores electrical energy. It is similar to a battery, but is smaller, lighter and loads much faster. Capacitors are used in many electronic devices today and can be manufactured from different types of materials. Leyden's pot was one of the first capacitors invented. Capacitors are usually made with two metal plates that are on top of each other and close to the other, but that do not really touch. When they are powered, they allow energy to be stored in an electric field. Because the plates need a large surface to store even a small amount of load, the plates are usually rolled in another form, like a cylinder. Sometimes, other forms of capacitors are used for special purposes."
"In capitalism, people can sell or lend their property, and others can buy or borrow it. If a person wants to buy, and another person wants to sell them, they do not need to get permission from a higher power. People can have a market (buy and sell between them) without anyone telling them about it. People who own capital are sometimes called capitalists (people who support capitalism are also called capitalists). They can hire anyone who wants to work in their factories, stores or land for the wages they offer. The word capital can be used to mean things that produce more things or money. For example, lands, factories, shops, tools and machines are capital. If someone has money that can be invested, that money is also capital. In capitalist systems, many people are workers (or proletarians). They are used to earn money to live."
"Can you imagine eating the same food for your whole life? As the eucalyptus have poisons in their leaves that prevent most animals from eating them, but not the koalas! Now it's a cool feature of a superhero! But how can they survive on nothing but toxic leaves? Well, it turns out that there are special microbes in the koalas tummies that really work hard to break the toxic parts of the leaves into small pieces that can't hurt the koala. Most of the microbes in the koala belly are just hanging, a good example of commensalism. This means that these microbes don't help break poisons, but they don't hurt the koalas either. A microbe that can break the leaves, Lonepinella koalarum, is an important side of the fight against poison and forms a mutualism with the koalas."
"Sofia told us about his own experience with the game of memory. However, not everyone is the same, and we can't be sure that the game will work for someone else. Therefore, it's important to test the game with a large group of people. This is called using a large sample size. A sample is the scientific word for the group included in the study — because it's a sample of the population. Although we can't ask every person in the world to take part in the study, using a large sample size helps us make sure that the results we find are true for more than one person. If our sample is large enough, it will be a good example of the entire population."
"Neurons are cells contained in the brain and spinal cord that specialize in communicating information within the body. Neurons are important for many things, including displacement, breathing, thought and pain. If these cells are injured due to an accident, for example, the body can no longer perform some of these important functions. Therefore, a person may become disabled in some way. To help patients with brain or spinal cord injuries, scientists and doctors may be able to replace damaged neurons with new cells in the injured person. By using new cells to replace lost injury neurons, it is possible that patients may recover some of their lost abilities, such as displacement."
"As the industrial revolution accelerated, the factories moved into one city after another, attracting many workers from the countryside to the cities. Thousands of people who had lived according to the old planting and harvesting rhythms began to live according to the new rhythms of the modern factory. In the late 1800s, the industrial revolution spread beyond Great Britain. It spread on the water plane called the Channel to Europe and across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States. It also began to enter a new phase of development. Britain took the lead in the first phase of the industrial revolution, which included steam energy, coal and cotton manufacturing."
"Our ears are complex anatomical structures which are separated into three main parts, the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear is the only visible part of the ear and is mainly used for the funneling of the sound of the environment in the ear canal. From there, the sound moves into the middle ear, where it vibrates the tympanum and three tiny bones, called bones, which transmit the sound energy to the inner ear. The energy continues to move towards the inner ear, where it is received by the cochlea. The cochlea is a structure inside the ear that is in the shape of a snail shell, and it contains the Corti Organ, where are present the sensory ""hair cells"" that can feel the sound energy. When the cochlea receives the sound, it amplifies the signal detected by these hair cells and transmits the signal through the auditory nerve to the brain."
"A million years ago, a soccer pearl was formed. When it was discovered, people fought to own this powerful jewel. During the First World Soccer War, the pearl was lost. No one knew what happened to it. Many years passed. The soccer pearl was found only when the greatest soccer star was born. Not long ago, there was a boy named David. He was of a poor family. Before David's father died, he gave the pearl of soccer to his son. At first, the boy did not know the power of the jewel. He was a teenager when he used the pearl to play soccer. David had not gone to school. But with the power of the pearl, he won all the games he played with his friends. He realized that he could make money for his family to play soccer. He was going to open a shop for his mother and send his brother and sisters to the best professional world. David became a schoolboy."
"A digital object identifier (or DOI) is a permanent way to identify a document online. This identification is not related to its current location. A typical use of a DOI is to give a scientific document or article a unique number that can be used by anyone who finds the document's location. It may also allow an electronic copy to be found, for example, on the Internet. The DOI system has a DOI resolution system that is used to locate the document. When the document is moved, the DOI resolution system is updated with the new location of the document. For example, doi:10.1016/j.iheduc.2008.03.001 links to ""Web 2.0 authority: Issues of Reference and citation for academic integrity"" by Kathleen Gray et al. The work was published in The Internet and Higher Education, Vol. 11, No. 2, 2008."
"Organisms can synchronize the entry into a dormant phase with their environment by predictive or correlative means. Predictive dormancy occurs when an organism enters a dormant phase before the onset of adverse conditions. For example, day length and decreasing temperature are used by many plants as triggers to begin dormancy before the onset of winter. Correlational dormancy occurs when organisms enter a dormant phase after adverse conditions. This is often found in regions where the climate is unpredictable. Sudden changes in conditions can result in a high mortality rate in animals that depend on correlative dormancy. On the other hand, its use can be beneficial, as organisms remain active longer and are able to make greater use of available resources."
"Bamboo, unlike other grasses, live primarily in association with forests. Two different types of bamboo are recognized: thick, hard, ""wooded"" bamboos, reaching up to 40 m tall, and softer, ""herbaceous"" bamboos, rarely reaching more than 1 m high. Worldwide, more than 1,650 bamboo species are known, and although many people think that bamboos are Asian, 530 species (about one third of the total diversity of bamboo) are native to the Western Hemisphere. With the exception of Canada, all countries in the Americas have at least one species of bamboo – even the United States has three. In this article, we will focus on Mexican bamboos. Mexico has 56 of the 530 bamboo species, 52 of which are woody bamboos and 4 are herbaceous bamboos. A total of 24 Mexican bamboo species live in the cloudy forest, so this type of vegetation is very important for Mexican bamboos."
"The goat, the dog and the cow were great friends. One day, they went by taxi. They reached the end of their journey. The driver asked them to pay their prices. The cow paid his price. The dog paid an extra fee, because he did not have the correct money. The driver was about to give Dog his currency. Suddenly, the goat fled without paying. The driver was very upset. He fled without giving Dog his currency. That's why, even today, the dog runs towards a car to search inside. He is looking for the driver who owes him money. The goat flees from the noise of a car. She is afraid that she will be stopped in order not to pay her price. The cow is not disturbed by the cars. The cow takes her time to cross the road. She knows that she paid her full price."
"At that time, Hyena burst out laughing and began to roll on the ground. She said, ""It is a striking truth!"" Goat took advantage of this and ran to her village. Hyena ran after Goat and soon began to catch him. ""Give me another truth, quickly!"" she commanded. Goat said, ""The second truth is, if I go back to the village and tell them that I met you, but you did not eat me, no one will believe it."" Again, Hyena began to roll on the ground with laughter. She said, ""It is the truth!"" For the second time, Goat ran and got close to the village. Very quickly, Hyena caught up with Goat. ""There is still a truth that says nothing!"" Hyena cried. Goat said, ""The third truth is, if you continue to joke so, it means that you are not really hungry!"" Hyena laughed until she weeps, rolling on the ground. ""It is very true!"""
"They invited all the animals to watch the race. Chameleon and Rabbit lined up and waited for the signal. At the beginning of the race, Chameleon jumped on Rabbit's tail. The animals laughed and laughed. Rabbit didn't realize that Chameleon was on his tail. Upon hearing the noise, Rabbit derailed at a stop. Chameleon jumped off Rabbit's tail. ""Hey, look where you're going! It's time you're here,"" Chameleon screamed at Rabbit. Rabbit was surprised. He started running. He didn't know Chameleon had jumped on his tail again. As Rabbit was approaching the finish line, the animals saw that Chameleon was still on Rabbit's tail. They hit and laughed. Rabbit heard the noise and thought Chameleon had already arrived in front of him. When they arrived at the finish line, Chameleon jumped on Rabbit's tail."
"An ink is a small box that contains a pad of fabric or other material. It is impregnated with ink (the stamp is in ink). A marker is pressed on the stamp, then on the paper. Any mark raised on the stamp leaves an ink impression on the paper. Ink pads are used with rubber stamps. On the stamp is the symbol of an organization, for example. After a form has been passed by an official, it is stamped to show that it is authentic. Another variant is a date stamp, placed on all letters arriving in the building. Another version is a stamp with a facsimile (copy) of an official's signature."
"Irrigation can be pumped from rivers, natural lakes, or lakes created by dams, wells, or allowed to flow to the fields by force of gravity along open canals or pipes. Irrigation can be applied to plants by water sprinklers that throw water under pressure, or by watering boxes. In irrigation of water sprinklers, water is moved through pipes to water sprinklers scattered around and inside the field. Irrigation of central pivots is a type of irrigation of water sprinklers. In drip irrigation, water is brought to plants by pipes with small holes or special emitters spaced along the pipe. Surface methods allow water to flow on the surface of the soil from canals or pipes. Traditional methods allow water to flow over the entire surface of the field, but drip irrigation allows for direct flow to the roots of each plant and much less water is lost by impregnating the soil."
"The political movement that tried to place Stuart kings on the thrones of England, Scotland and the Kingdom of Ireland took its name in the Latin form of Jacobus, by the name of King James II and King VII. Jacobitism began after the deposition of James II and King VII in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary II with her husband and cousin William of Orange. The Stuarts then lived on the European continent, sometimes trying to recover the throne with the help of France or Spain. The most important places of Jacobism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the Scottish Highlands. In England, jacobitism was the strongest in the north, and some support was also in Wales. A large number of Catholics appreciated jacobitism. They hoped that the Stuarts would end up with bad laws."
"Ticks ingest the blood of the host, and in the blood there are cells that contain pathogenic microbes. We call them infected cells. Once the infected cells are ingested, their first stop will be the intestines of the tick, which function as the stomach of the tick, where these microbes begin their journey through the body of the tick. According to the pathogenic microbe, they can remain in the intestines for shorter or longer periods, for example, for only a few hours, for days, or for weeks."
"Once upon a time there was a prince who had no name of birth. He was the only child of King Dunoma, who wanted a successor. He was born after several years of waiting. When he was born, the king was so happy that he decided to keep the name of his son a secret until he grew up. Then, any daughter who knew that the name would become the prince's wife. When the prince was old enough to get married, the king ordered the heart of the city to make an announcement. ""It is a contest for young women throughout the kingdom! Say the name of the prince and become his wife!"" announced the head of the city. The daughters dedicated the remaining days to preparation."
"At this stage, fruits are generally hard and unattractive to predators, including us! After seed development and fruit growth, fruit properties change to make fruit more attractive to potential consumers, such as animals, birds and humans. These changes include the most common ways to judge whether a fruit is ripe or not, including external characteristics, such as softness to the touch, and internal characteristics, such as softness. Fruits also change colour as they mature. This occurs due to the degradation of a green pigment called chlorophyll, as well as the creation and accumulation of other pigments responsible for red, violet or blue (anthocyanin), or bright red, yellow and orange (caotenoids), to name a few."
"Trees are much like people: they are under stress and are infected with insects or diseases and they can be attacked by fire, storms, floods and droughts. We call these things that attack or infect trees disturbance. Trees are not like people, because they can't go to the doctor to get better and they can't get away from anything that bothers them. This last part is very important because it means that for trees to have existed for hundreds of millions of years, they had to have the ability to cope with disturbances without a doctor. As you can imagine, different types of trees have evolved different ways of dealing with certain disturbances."
"In nature, living beings are connected by food webs. Food webs show us how animals and plants are linked by food relationships, like birds eating fish. But how have nutrients returned to the food web? The answer is bacteria! Bacteria are impossible to see with the naked eye. But they are almost everywhere in the world and are very important for recycling nutrients in habitats, such as a river. Scientists use the DNA of bacteria to determine which bacterial species are present and how these different bacterial species recycle nutrients in a river. Knowing which species are present helps scientists use bacteria to monitor changes in river habitats."
"Every day after school, Abebe went to the field to help his father. Next to the teff field was a football field. One afternoon while Abebe was hunting birds, four English boys came to play soccer. The boys started playing. The ball bounced and landed in the teff field. The ball damaged a bit of teff. One of the boys ran into the field to get the ball, and he damaged more teff! They continued to play. The ball bounced and landed on the harvest again and again. The boys continued to run in the field to get the ball. Every time they damaged some of the teff. Abebe and his father became more and more angry about the destruction of their harvest. Neither Abebe nor his father could speak English. They did not know how to tell the boys: ""Don't come in this field. Stop damaging our crops!"""
"People feel socially connected when they feel comfortable, confident, and as they belong not only to their family and friends, but to the community. If people struggle to feel socially connected, then they may feel unable to relate to people around them, and they may struggle to make friends or understand their role in the world and feel alone because of it. Feeling alone can then lead to a number of other problems, such as low self-esteem, not trusting other people, and simply feel alone and as if they do not belong. Imagine, what would happen if a person who already feels these things is also cyberbullying? Such a person could feel as there is no one to turn to. Since everyone is different, people can feel this feeling of connection and belonging in different ways."
"The sea grasses are part of a group of plants called monocotyledons. This group of plants also includes grasses growing on earth, lilies (parents closest to sea grasses) and palm trees. The sea grasses have roots, veins and leaves. The sea grasses, like other plants, have special food producers inside their cells, called chloroplasts. The chloroplasts use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen for growth, through the process called photosynthesis. The grasses within the herb tissue then transport sugar and oxygen around the plant. The veins also contain pockets of air, called lacunae, which help to maintain the leaves of the herbage floating in water. The grasses have roots and rhizomes (thicker stems), which extend into the sediments under the leaves. The roots and rhizomes absorb and store the sediments in the sea. However, the plants are less complex and help to anchor the plants."
"Volcanists study the personality of volcanoes because this information can determine how far from volcanoes the eruptions will have an impact: rocks from the fields of Phlegrean have been found at 4,000 km! Now we will talk about the various dangers associated with volcanic eruptions. When a volcano bursts explosively, the magma cools and turns into volcanic ash and gas, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). The ash moves so quickly that it is injected far into the atmosphere, as high as aircraft can travel. Volcanic ash can prevent aircraft from flying, because the ash is bad for their engines. Volcanic ash and gas from large eruptions can travel into the atmosphere around the Earth, changing the climate. Volcanic gases form aerosols (mix of fine particles) in the atmosphere that reflect solar radiation back into space and lead to global cooling."
"Although anyone, from children to the elderly, can come into contact with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the vast majority of people (about 90%) who are infected with this bacterium will eliminate it through the work of the immune system. However, some people (about 10%) who come into contact with M. tuberculosis cannot completely control the bacteria. These people can develop a disease called active tuberculosis (ABT), with fever, cough and weight loss. In these cases, M. tuberculosis makes his home in the lungs and can be transmitted to others when the sick people evict the bacteria by cough."
"We classify spiders into more than a hundred families, such as jumping spiders, crab spiders, wolf spiders, spiders with an ogre face, spiders eating birds (which are also called tarantulas), and spiders with a primitive segment. Some spiders are very good at camouflage, the art of disguise. Often, the colors of camouflaged spiders mix well in the environment, but spiders do much more than that to protect themselves. Some, for example, are difficult to distinguish from ants, and this disguise makes them safe from predators who hate prickly ants."
"An antibiotic is a compound that kills bacteria. Antibiotics stop the essential cellular activities that allow the bacteria to live. For example, some antibiotics damage the cell wall, and some prevent the reproduction of bacteria. The first antibiotic, penicillin, was discovered more than 90 years ago. Since then, many other antibiotics have been found. Since the discovery and use of antibiotics, bacteria have evolved that resist antibiotics and multiply even when antibiotics are present. These bacteria are called ""antibiotic resistant bacteria."" Antibiotic resistance evolves by mutation (genetic changes) in bacterial DNA that allows bacteria to survive in the presence of antibiotics. A year ago, the World Health Organization published a report on 12 different bacterial strains that resist antibiotics."
"You've guessed it – science! Fluorescent colors are very special. You may have seen fluorescence before if you've ever seen a black light poster or a painting illuminated with black light. Fluorescent colors seem to shine, because they absorb a color of light and then they emit a different color. It's because of the way pigment molecules (color) release energy from the light they absorb. When a pigment molecule absorbs energy from light, it usually slowly releases energy from heat. Instead, a fluorescent molecule releases part of the energy from light that it absorbs as new light that has less energy than the light that has been absorbed."
"Shakespeare was an innovator of the language. People quote his plays all the time without realizing it. If you've ever heard someone say that ""love is blind"" or ""all that shines is not gold"", they quote The Merchant of Venice. In fact, Shakespeare is credited with inventing more than 1700 words and phrases. Do you know the joint that leans in the middle of your arm? Without Shakespeare, we wouldn't have the word for elbow! Not only did Shakespeare shape the English language, but he also had a hand in almost all forms of popular culture. From book to music to modern theatre, Shakespeare served as inspiration."
"When the winds under a storm are unstable, they blow at different speeds. These unstable winds under the storm can begin to turn. If the rotating air is pushed up in the storm, it can gain strength and speed. A cone of dark air can turn down the storm. This is called a funnel cloud. If the funnel touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Tornados can form very quickly. They create the strongest winds on the planet, with speeds that can reach 200 miles per hour. In 1967, a powerful tornado hit Oak Lawn, Illinois. Patti Ernst lived through this tornado as a child. ""Our garage exploded. Our car was crouched,"" she recalled in an interview with Chicago television station, WGN."
"""The rainbow is a magical river with healing powers. But it's so high in the sky that you can't reach it. If you catch a cold, the rainbow can't help you."" The kids thought of it. ""Mother, please tell us our rainbow story,"" said Erdoo. ""Yes, please mother, I want to hear it too,"" Udoo cried in. ""My three,"" Eryum begged, rising three little fingers. ""Well, let me see, mmmm,"" she said cheerfully. ""Okay loveies, gather."
"Lion said to Hyena, ""Can't we even find peace in our dens? You throw dust in our eyes!"" Hyena replied, ""King, I didn't want to disrespect you! I only run after my food!"" Lion said, ""You are also food for me, Hyena. Did I chase you? You came to me. Don't be angry with me later."" Lion said to the sheep, ""Why did you come into the bush?"" The sheep replied, ""I came because I am a diviner."" Lion said, ""Prepare the traditional medicines to prove that you are a diviner."
"There are two ways that scientists talk about amnesia. First, amnesia can occur at the same time as other problems. For example, there are diseases and injuries that can cause damage to the hippocampus and memory loss. These include Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain damage. These two conditions can cause memory loss, but they usually also cause other problems for a person's ability to think. For example, a person with Alzheimer's disease or traumatic brain damage may have difficulty planning for the day or making good decisions."
"Heart disease is a major cause of health problems in the world. There are many types of heart disease, but a disease that is quite common and can have many negative side effects is called cardiomyopathy. We know that humans and many mammals, including dogs, get cardiomyopathy. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart changes shape and often electrical signals within the heart. Due to these changes, the heart is not able to pump blood around the body very well, which means that oxygen and nutrients are not delivered to the body at optimal levels. This can affect daily life, and it can also cause early death. Understanding cardiomyopathy and finding mutations in the genes that cause it is essential, as this information can help us diagnose, treat, and prevent this heart disorder. We can try to repair broken hearts that do not work properly."
"One day, Cat walked around the garden. She loved the sweet smell of flowers. She liked to touch their soft petals. Cat wanted her to see flowers, just once. ""They are charming,"" she said. ""Every day, Cat walked in the garden. She knew her way. Today, she raised her head towards the sky. Suddenly, she heard thunder and lightning. ""I have to hurry back home,"" said Chat. The rain began to fall. Cat slipped, lost her balance and fell. She hit her head on a stone. When Cat woke up, there were people around her. ""What happened?"" She asked. ""You fell and you hit her head,"" said her father. ""Thank God you are well,"" said her mother. ""Dad, Mom?"" asked Chat. She also called the names of her brothers and sisters."
"A nerve is a group of special nerve cells grouped in parallel. Another word for nerve cells is neuron. The special neurons grouped in the nerves take information (messages) to and from the human body to the central nervous system. The central nervous system (an acronym) CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The spinal cord is the big cord that goes from the brain to the back. It carries all the information that goes from the brain to the nerves of the body. All the nerves of the body make the peripheral nervous system (an acronym PNS). The brain and spinal cord are the CNS. All the nerves that come from the spinal cord are the PNS. Together, the CNS and PNS are the nervous system. The nervous system contains neurons and cells called glia. Glia cells keep the neurons safe and healthy. The neurons take messages to and CNS to the rest. Dendrite and axon are fibers that come out of the cellular body."
"Every day Emeka's father took him to school in his car. Emeka went home after school. One afternoon, Emeka's father stopped to buy something from a department store. From the car, Emeka looked at the road and saw an old man. He was carrying a heavy load on his head. He was tired and walking slowly. Emeka continued to look at him. The old man sat in the shade of a tree on the bridge and opened his bag. He had two bottles of flat plastic water, which he was doing in shoes. Emeka thought about this old man for a long time. He felt sad. When he came home, he couldn't eat. He thought about what he could do. He got up and took money from his money bag. He called Chita and jumped on his bike. Emeka went to the shop where his father had been shopping."
"The oldest hyena said, ""Let the strongest hyena stand on the ground and then the rest of us stay on the other's back. We will climb on the other's back until we reach the clouds."" They got along and started climbing on the other's back. Soon, there were no more hyenas on the ground, except the strongest. After the last hyena climbed, the hyena on the ground thought that the others had begun to eat. He asked, ""Why don't you give me food that you eat?"" However, the hyenas didn't reach the clouds. They didn't find any food and therefore had nothing to give to the strongest hyena standing on the ground. The strongest hyena became impatient and moved on the left side."
"She saw a brown ant on the dusty path. Fati saw a beautiful leaf. The leaf was bright and green. She put a finger on the beautiful leaf. Fati said: ""It does not look like a leaf."" Suddenly, the beautiful leaf moved! Fati said: ""It is not a beautiful leaf! It is a green snake! Fati shouted: ""Eii!"" She ran very quickly to look for her mother and her father. Fati saw her father and cried: ""A snake! A snake!"" The father said: ""Where? Where? Fati said: ""Here!"" Then her father pursued the green snake with a stick. The green snake fled. Father said: ""Fati, you are safe!"
"Otoliths, or ear stones, grow inside the inner ear of bony fishes. There are more than 28,000 species, including various species such as clown fish, hippocampus, salmon and tuna. Bonefishes have three pairs of otoliths – sagittae, lapilli and asteriscii. Otoliths are made of calcium carbonate, the same chemical compound as chalk and limestone. Different fishes have otoliths of different shape and size, so scientists can find otoliths in the poop of birds and seals to see what type of fish these animals eat-yuck! Otoliths allow fish to maintain balance and detect their depth of noise and water. Otoliths continually grow during the life of a fish, a few microns every day from birth to death."
"Colours are everywhere in nature, and they communicate useful information. Flowers use colors to announce that they have nectar, fruits change color when they are ripe, and birds and butterflies use their colored wings to find companions or to surprise enemies. To use this information, animals must be able to see colors. Humans have a ""trichromatic"" color vision, which means that all the colors we perceive can be produced by mixing three primary colors – red, green, and blue. This is because we have three types of light detection cells in our eyes, a kind sensitive to red, one to green, and one to blue light. Different species have different types of light detection cells. Bees also have three types, but they have cells that smell ultraviolet light instead of red light. But butterflies usually have 6 or more types of light detection cells, but we found a kind of swallow that has at least 15, which is the record among insects."
"On the day before the king and his family left, he organized a feast. Everyone attended. Leopards, snakes, rabbits, snails, birds and even ants came to the feast. The king spoke to the people, ""My family and I go to the other part of Okugbe Island. We want to feel the pain that others feel."" The people murmured among themselves. The elders did not believe it. But who could question the king? So everyone drank and enjoyed themselves. The next day the king and his family sailed. During the first two days, the boats rolled into the waters. The sky was clear, the sea was calm, and the journey was happy. On the third day, the sea became rough. The sky became cloudy. A great storm came upon them."
"Podcasting is a way to share information in the form of digital audio files. People often subscribe, download and share podcasts using a computer and listen to them on an MP3 player. Many podcasts are similar to radio or discussion programs. Some use other formats such as a continuous story, comedy program, conference or audio book. Podcasts can be found for almost anything. Radio programs, do it yourself, projects, special interest groups, religious sermons, comedy sketches, cartoons and anything you can find. Once a podcast is found, it can be subscribed to a magazine or newspaper and then downloaded. Once it is downloaded, it can be stored on an MP3 player to be listened to."
"The criminal justice system, which is at the root of the amendments to the Bill of Rights, now has three modern elements: law enforcement, which is a major issue in all areas of American life, from park guards to small municipal police forces to federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Enforcement is a vast and complex system because there are a considerable number of laws in our country. Every year, new laws are introduced by elected officials and current laws are amended. At the national level, thousands of laws and regulations codify our laws. In addition to federal laws, states have their own laws and regulations for matters and subjects left to the states to regulate."
"A typical photograph is a motionless image seen from a single point of view. In the real world, however, when we see a scene, we can move and look at things from different angles. Leika the dog is sitting by a chair. We can sometimes see more of the chair that we can see from Leika, according to our particular point of view. How much our view of Leika is blocked by the chair depends on where we are standing. It is also important to note that we get a sense of depth in these images. In the photos, we can say that the chair is (usually) closer to us than Leika, because it partially blocks our view of it."
"There are a lot of situations where you think about something or talk to someone while you're making a move with your body at the same time. For example, you can talk about your homework with your friend by walking to school. Or you can ride your bike while listening to music. At first glance, these situations don't seem to be tricky, and you've probably done such things a lot in your life. But what happens when you need to cross a busy street on your way to school? Maybe you'll stop talking for a while and focus your attention on traffic, so you can reach the other side of the street safely."
"To interpret the context in a social context, your brain relies on a network of brain regions, including frontal, temporal and island regions. These regions help you to update contextual information when you focus on something (say that the traffic light you walk on the street). This information helps you anticipate what could happen next, depending on your previous experiences. If there is a change in what you see (as you keep walking on the street, a bad Doberman appears), the frontal regions will activate and update predictions (""this can be dangerous!""). These predictions will be influenced by the context (""oh, the dog is on the leash"") and your previous experience (""yes, but once I have been attacked by a dog and it was very bad!""). If the frontal areas of a person are damaged, he or she will find it difficult to recognize the influence of the context. Thus, the Doberman cannot be perceived as a threat, even if this person has been attacked by other dogs before! The main role of the frontal events is to predict the actions that surround the frontal events."
"A solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy. Sometimes, the term solar cell is reserved for devices specifically designed to capture the energy of the sun, while the term photovoltaic cell is used when the light source is not specified. The device must perform only two functions: photogeneration of charge carriers (electrons and electron holes) in a light absorbing material, and separation of charge carriers to a conductive contact that transmits electricity. This conversion is called the photovoltaic effect, and the solar cell field is known as photovoltaic. Solar cells have many applications. They have long been used in situations where electricity from the grid is unavailable, such as in remote power systems, terrestrial orbit satellites and space probes, consumption systems, e.g. hand-held calculators or wristwatches, remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications."
"A musical synthesizer is an instrument that uses electricity to make musical sounds. Very often, synthesizers have a keyboard like that of a piano. When playing a piano keyboard, the sounds are made by hitting flexible hammers against tight strings. When playing a synthesizer keyboard, the sounds are made by activating and stopping the electric oscillators. Since the ""synthetor"" is such a great word, the word is usually shortened to ""synth"". An oscillator is something that ""vibrates"" or repeats the same pattern. The clock clock clock clock, for example, is a very slow oscillator. A piano string ""oscillates"" when struck by a hammer. Electric oscillators can be made using transistors. They transform electricity into electric patterns, or signals, which are repeated several times."
"Like Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease is also a neurodegenerative disease that causes movement problems and affects basal lymph nodes. Unlike Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease is a genetic disease. This means that if either parent has the disease, children are also very likely to have the disease. Huntington's disease is the result of abnormal accumulation of protein in the brain, which causes neuronal death, causing the disorder of movement. Primarily, individuals with this disease will show excessive movement, which is generally undesirable and unnecessary. For example, they often have constant vibrating limbs, something that is beyond their control."
"Long ago, there was a famine in the land of Taraba. People were forced to dig in hills of ants to find grains. There was a man called Vyandeh who could not provide food to his family. One day, he told his wife, ""Let me go get some food."" He left. While he was away, the woman could not wait for her return. So, she cooked some pumpkin that she got from her mother for the children, Vyange, Avaungwa and Jessica. Vyandeh came back late, with nothing for the family. The woman, Aershimana welcomed him and asked, ""All that for the children to eat?"" He replied, ""No."" She gave him pumpkin, but he did not satisfy him. He asked, ""Where did you get pumpkin?"" Aershimana replied, ""My mother keeps pumpkins on the roof of her room."" At midnight, Vyandeh woke up. He decided to steal the remaining pumpkin."
"Welding is a way to heat pieces of metal with electricity or flame so that they melt and stick together. There are many types of welding, including arc welding, resistance welding and gas welding. The most common type is arc welding. Anyone close to arc welding must wear a helmet or special glasses because the bow is so bright. Looking at the bow without visual protection can cause permanent damage to the eyes. It is also important to cover all your skin because it can give you something like a sunburn."
"A text processor is a computer program (often a text editor) or a special computer designed to modify texts with colors and different font sizes and styles, or texts that will be printed. Most of these programs now have useful tools (tools) to make good texts. Important instruments include spelling and grammar corrector, number of words (which also counts letters and lines). Moreover, with such programs, one can make attractive documents, add images in documents, make web pages, graphs etc. In addition, they show synonyms (like words) of words and some can read the text aloud."
"They took Jallo and his mother to the fruit trees of the village and invited them to take all the fruit they loved. Except in the mango. In the garden, Jallo saw a very large mango with many ripe mangoes. Jallo was surprised to see so many ripe mangoes. He decided to take one. Although Jallo was asked not to eat mango, he did not listen. He said, ""Whatever happens, that this happens, I want to eat this mango."" Jallo's mother warned him again. But he refused to obey him. By eating the mango, his stomach suddenly started to grow up. Jallo felt badly. He began to cry. His head started to swell. Then, a mango grew from his head! Jallo has become a mango. Since then, when someone touches the branches of this mango, he sings a song. The tree sings, ""Who does not obey the elders, I will regret it."""
"During the school holidays, Kweku Twim went to Simpa (Winneba). He went to spend the holidays with his uncle, Kobina Amfo, who was a very good fisherman. Kobina Amfo had a lot of canoes in Simpa. When Kweku Twim came back from Simpa, he visited his friend Kwesi Gyasi. He spoke to Kwesi about his experiences and his pleasure, especially to swim in the sea! Kwesi was interested and would have wanted him to travel with Kweku to the sea. One afternoon, the two friends decided to swim in the village stream. They went out when no one was watching. As soon as they arrived at the stream, Kweku Twim jumped into the water with a splash. He called Kwesi Gyasi to join him but he did not remember his mother's advice."
"On a Friday, the three friends decided to go looking for kola nuts in the forest. They wanted to sell to the market. After their parents left for the market, they also went to the forest. They came to the river Dome, which was very full. Ntiamoa shouted, ""Eei! How can we cross this river?"" Nyameky replied, ""I read that when the rivers overflow their shores you can cross by making a sacrifice."" The children had nothing to offer at that time, they made promises to the river. Ntiamoa said, ""Nana Dome if you allow me to cross, I will offer you three times three kola nuts."" Nyameky made the same promise. When Adena's tower came, because of her pride, she promised, ""Nana Dome, if you allow me to cross, on my return I will offer three times two kola nuts and two eggs."" River Dome replied, ""My grandchildren, cross, and remember to fulfill your promises, after all the forest went through."
"The way ticks develop and interact with their environment is complicated, but it is important to understand how ticks develop and search for hosts. Any information on how ticks live is the basis for understanding the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases, which means how these diseases spread and how we can control them. Since ticks are blood eaters, they must ingest large amounts of blood to fully develop. An adult female I. solitarius can ingest up to 5 to 10 times her blood weight in a diet. After the female feeds on a host and her companions, she falls to the ground and finds refuge in leaves or other natural materials to lay thousands of eggs. Temperature controls egg development."
"In the food industry, corn starch, derived from ground corn grains, is added to various foods such as pasta, candies, sauces, breads, soups, stews and baby foods. Some edible oils and syrups are also made from corn, such as fructose and other sweeteners, used in most sodas or even juices sold in supermarkets. Processed corn is also used in medicines, cosmetics, glues, paper, textiles, paints and solvents."
"Whales and other marine mammals who dive to get food under the water often dive in baths. Baths are periods when the whale dives several times, with only a short amount of time on the surface before the next dive. We think that marine mammals dive into baths to get as much food as possible while they dive. For example, if they find a large fish school, they don't want to spend as much time on the surface as the school escapes, so they dive again to get more fish off the surface. Therefore, they only stay on the surface for long enough to rebuild their oxygen. However, time on the surface may not be long enough to remove all nitrogen from their blood."
"As we breathe, we inhale to increase our oxygen intake, and we exhale to get rid of excess carbon dioxide. Thus, the deep breath that accompanies the yawning has led many people to believe that the purpose of yawning is to increase oxygen levels. Although this explanation seems to make sense, the research conducted 30 years ago firmly rejected this idea. In a clear test of whether yawning was caused by low levels of oxygen, Dr. Robert Provine et al. designed an experiment in which they changed the content of the air that was inhaled by the laboratory participants and then saw the effects that air had on yawning. The researchers had distinct conditions in which the participants inhaled air with additional oxygen or carbon dioxide. These experiments demonstrated that neither pure oxygen respiration nor the increase in carbon dioxide levels changed the rate of yawning in humans. In other words, the results of this study showed that the yawning in the air was not affected."
"During a drought, Yihdego left the house to find a job. At that time, Tiebe was pregnant with their second child. After a long absence, Yihdego decided to return home. Before starting his trip, he went to see an old wise man to ask for advice. After Yihdego greeted the old man, he said, ""I have been away from my house and my family for a long time. Now I want to return. I need your blessing and advice."" ""Listen to my son, on your home trip, don't use a shortcut. Don't comment on everything you see. Don't make a decision while you're angry"" advised the old man. Yihdego left his trip. He met four merchants. They came to the road."
"There was a hyena and a donkey who lived near a city. They met by chance and became friends. They got together to share the food and defended each other. They did everything together. They even started to live together. One day they went to a river to drink water. On their way, they chatted and laughed. On the river, the donkey went down and drank downstream. Hyena drank upstream. Suddenly, the hyena stopped drinking. He complained, ""Donkey, why do you stir the water?"" Donkey was silent and continued to drink. Hyena was very angry. ""Don't listen? Donkey, I'm talking to you, Donkey, shouted the hyena. The donkey looked at the hyena and asked, ""How long did the water move upstream?"" The hyena replied, ""The water began to flow upstream when we became friends."
"""Where are you going?"" asked the serpent to Berhe. ""I cross the river,"" Berhe replied. ""The serpent went up on Berhe's head and they crossed the river."" Berhe told the serpent to go down. ""The serpent refused, ""I am not going, I am comfortable here."" Berhe was worried. If he hit the snake with his stick, he would hurt his head. If he took the snake, he would bite it. Berhe decided to get advice. He wanted Hyena's advice on the problem. ""Good afternoon, hyena,"" said Berhe. ""Good afternoon, how can I help you?"" asked hyena. Berhe continued, ""I know you are very right, so I want you to judge us."""
"There were four lambs who lived in a house with their mother. Mother was on the way to the market. ""You will only open the door when I say, My children, she warns the lambs. Meanwhile, a fox was nearby and heard the mother. He went to the house and said, ""My children, open the door."" One of the lambs said, ""No, it is not the voice of our mother. Our mother's voice is soft."" The fox was angry. The fox wanted to make his voice like the mother of lambs. He decided to eat butter. He went to a shopkeeper. ""Give me butter, or I will eat you,"" threatened the fox. The merchant gave him butter. The fox went to the lambs and said, ""My children, open the door."" A lamb looked through the hole of the door and saw the black leg of the fox. ""No, our mother's legs are red!"" cried the lamb."
"A long time ago, there was an intelligent cat and a stupid dog. The intelligent cat lived well in the home of a rich family. The stupid dog was hungry in the street. ""How does a rich family allow you to live in their house?"" the foolish dog asked the intelligent cat. The intelligent cat replied, ""I live with people because I am being treated and burying my waste. I ask for food by saying, sweet."" ""If I do the same, will they allow me to live in a house?"" the dog asked. The cat replied, ""Yes, do what I told you and they will allow you. They will give you food."" The foolish dog said, ""Today, I will not hurt you."" ""He almost had me this time. I don't want to meet him again,"" said the cat jumping."
"She saw a beautiful girl. One day she was very hungry. She thought of ways to get something to eat. She met a man who asked her, ""How are you a young girl? What makes you sad?"" The girl replied, ""I am hungry."" The man was sorry for the girl. He told her that there was a feast in the neighborhood and she had to go and steal food. The girl had never stolen before. The girl got up quickly and went to the house that held the feast. When she approached, she forgot the instructions on how to fly. She sang several times: I came to steal food, f-o-o-d, I walk slowly, slo-wly. People heard the girl's song from afar until she arrived at home."
"Studies have shown that people who are more grateful than others will automatically think about things that happen to them in a more positive way. Most of the situations that happen in our lives are not 100% good or 100% bad. How we think or interpret what happens to us plays a big role in the way we feel the situation. Most people have learned ""the habits of thought"" that they repeat over and over again. One of these habits of thought is what is called a ""positive interpretation bias"", which means that you are more likely to interpret a neutral or negative situation in a more positive way. For example, after falling off your bike, you might think ""I was so lucky that I was not hurt"" and feel very grateful. Or, you might think ""I can't believe I was so stupid to fall off my bike"" and feel really angry."
"A long time ago, at the bottom of the forests, King Leopard began to think about the future. He thought, ""I am getting old and one day I will die. A wise leader should choose a successor while he was still young and healthy."" But how could King Leopard choose? He loved all the members of the animal kingdom the same! King Leopard had an idea. He sent his messengers to the forests. He told them to ask all the animals of the kingdom to come to the palace. He was going to make a big party and he was going to make an important announcement. Far away the messengers were running, at the four corners of the forest. On the night of the feast, all the animals were at the palace. They sang and danced and spent a great time. After the moon had risen above the trees, King Leopard came and stood in the middle of the clearing. The animals stopped singing and dancing."
"Using mathematics, brain waves can be described by their characteristics. The frequency, or wavelength, shows how often the wave repeats in a certain time. The amplitude describes how ""all"" the wave is, and the wave phase describes its position in the wave cycle at specific moments (whether at the top or the bottom or somewhere in the interval). The waves are measured in microvolts (mV or 1/1,000,000 volt). A typical alpha wave is about 20 to 100 μV. Brain waves give scientists an idea of the excitability of millions of neurons under each electrode. Previous experiments have shown that certain types of brain waves are related to specific brain functions. For example, the act of seeing, called visual perception, is associated with a specific wave type, called alpha wave."
"On a Saturday morning, Tarik and Bedilu took their flock to the common pasture. They also wore their school books to study for the exams. Bedilu said, ""Let's play kisara for a few minutes to relax our minds."" Tarik replied, ""No, we should start studying!"" ""We're going to study soon. Please play! Bedilu begged. Finally, the boys were playing kisara. (Kisara is a game where the players throw flat stones or pieces into a small hole, standing about a metre away.) Without notice, they played the game for about two hours. When they looked at them, they couldn't see their sheep anywhere. They were running everywhere in search of sheep. From a distance, they saw a wolf hunting their sheep! Then they saw that the wolf had killed the sheep of Tarik. He started to cry. He knew that his father would punish him severely. When Bedilu brought back his sheep, Tarik didn't return home. He decided to spend the night in his big tree."
"To study liver regeneration, in 1931, Higgins and Anderson performed a rat experiment, in which the two largest liver lobes were carefully removed. Working with animals involves the use of clean instruments, anesthesia and respectful treatment. Because the liver has many blood vessels, to avoid bleeding, the main liver vessels were linked with a special thread. Higgins and Anderson found that the rat liver has returned to its normal size in 7 days. Today, this is still the most popular way for scientists to study liver regeneration."
"Gong! Gong! Gong! We heard the village bell early in the morning. ""Boys, wake up and prepare the tools,"" Grandma called from her room. We yawned and stretched out of bed. That day was nhimbe in the field of Mbuya Sigauke. We went to the hozi and collected all the tools. We carried the tools in the fields. The village of Chamutsa had come to help Mbuya Sigauke. Every agricultural season, the villagers helped the elderly to deweet their fields. Everyone is given a portion of the grass. This portion is called nima. When it was noon, the villagers sitting under the big tree of Mutsamvi to rest. Mbuya Sigauke gave the maheu villagers a drink. The villagers rested to drink maheu. After the rest, the villagers finished weeding the field. Mbuya Sigauke was very happy. She thanked all the villagers for helping him. In Zimbabwe, the people made nhimbe to help them do their work."
"A concussion of the brain is an injury to the brain caused by sudden and brutal movement of the head, usually due to a stroke or a shaking on the head or body that causes the brain to move quickly inside the skull. The resulting injury is called a slight traumatic brain injury, most of the time called a concussion of the brain. There are many different definitions of concussion of the brain, but they have all things in common.These common features include changes in brain function, including changes in how you think (cognitive changes), in how your brain works (neurological changes), and in how you feel (physical and emotional changes).These changes may or may not be accompanied by a temporary loss of consciousness, also known as fainting or fainting. The sudden movement of the brain can stretch and injure brain cells, which can change the way these cells work. These changes may be short-lived or long-lasting, but most of the time, especially the cells can heal and work normally in 10 days for the brain. Sometimes, in 10 days for the brain, sometimes again, the brain can get back to normal."
"It is difficult to understand how little children learn something as complicated as language. Do they copy their parents? Do they start making sounds until the right words come out? Do they find patterns and learn what sounds go a lot together, like b-a-b-y? Do they learn that different words correspond to different things and use this to understand what words mean? Do they make assumptions about what words come next and learn from their mistakes? Do they just want to have fun with their moms, dads, brothers and sisters, and that motivates them to learn the language? Different scientists think that learning is done in different ways. There are so many possibilities."
"""What happened to my spinach?"" she asked. Sipho was so afraid that he could not speak. While they were standing in the garden, Thabo came. ""Thabo, do you know anything about my spinach?"" asked Grandma. ""No, Grandma. I don't know anything about the spinach,"" said Thabo. ""Did you leave the door open? I told you never to leave it open."" No, Grandma!"" said the boys in one voice. ""The two boys started to blame themselves. They started arguing. Grandma heard them arguing and called them. Grandma asked them what they were talking about. The boys told her the truth about the spinach. They admitted to the grandmother that they had left the door open. They were very kind."
"The constitution of a country (or state) is a particular type of law that indicates how its government is supposed to function. It indicates how the country's leaders must be chosen and how long they can remain in office, how new laws are drafted and old laws must be amended or deleted according to the law, what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be amended. Limits are imposed on the government to the extent that they have power within the Constitution (see Rule of Law)."
"A situation is a ""game"" every time (i) more than one person makes a decision and (ii) people's decisions have an impact on each other. Just about everything we do in life is a game in the sense of the game-theory. At home, at school, wherever we go, and just about everything we do, we play games. Don't believe me? Think again at the very beginning of your day, when you woke up. The speed with which you got out of bed touched your parents — and how early they woke you up — so it was a game! Think about what happened next, throughout the day."
"The similarities and differences between the microbiomes of different animals made us wonder whether species with similar diets have similar microbiomes, or whether microbiomes are only similar because the species are related. For example, a dolphin and penguin have a similar microbiome because they both eat fish? Or, even if they have similar diets, dolphins and penguins have different microbiomes because they are not closely related species? In science, it is common to create a hypothesis, then design an experiment, or a series of experiments, to test it. The results of the experiments are then reported in a reliable scientific review."
"In organizations such as the United Nations, each country sends delegates to represent them. Before a general election in the United States, the process of selecting candidates begins with delegates. At the state level, each of the major political parties selects delegates to attend a national convention. The two ways in which delegates are selected are caucus and primary election. Each state may have different ways of choosing delegates such as political parties. The Republican Party allows each state to decide how to choose delegates. The Democratic Party uses a proportional method to assign delegates. The percentage of delegates each candidate is allocated depends on the caucus or number of candidates elected. The candidate ""X"" may have 40 percent, the candidate ""Y"" may have 20 percent, while the candidate ""Z"" may have 50 percent. Any remaining percent may be undecided votes or for other candidates."
"Antibiotics have been used for almost a century to treat bacterial diseases in humans and also in animals. Throughout this time, bacteria have sought strategies to survive antibiotic treatment. Imagine a battlefield, where a population of bacteria is attacked by small bullets (antibiotics). If one of the bacteria can find a shield to protect itself, it will survive. Surviving bacteria will have the advantage of being resistant to antibiotics forever and their descendants. That's why, when you get sick, you have to take all the pills prescribed by the doctor, even if you already feel better. This is very important to prevent ""survivors"" in the battle! Antibiotic resistant bacteria (called ""superbugs"") are very dangerous for us, because we don't have any weapons to fight them. Moreover, these resistant bacteria can be transmitted to other people or even to animals."
"Optogenetics is a method for controlling the activity of a neuron using light and genetic engineering. Genetic engineering is a process where scientists change the information in the genetic code (plans) of a living thing. In optogenetic studies, scientists take the genetic code of the neurons they want to study and add a new code. The new code allows these neurons to make special proteins, called opsins, that respond to light. Opsins occur naturally and have first been discovered in algae, which use these proteins to help them move to light. But how does opsin penetrate into the neuron? This requires specialized laboratory techniques."
"Why do humans feel the need to be creative and to appreciate creative material? While creativity is a fundamental part of human thought, what counts as creativity and how to measure it? Creativity is often perceived as a subjective field, which means that everyone's personal opinion about creativity is different, so we need to have a really clear definition to understand what creativity is. So, what is creativity? Although there are many elements of creativity, including originality, pleasure, value, process and imagination, the definition that scientists use to study creativity puts these elements together to say that creativity is a capacity to produce something that is both new (or original) and of value to someone. This definition allows scientists to develop testable hypotheses about how creativity comes from the human brain."
"In a certain year, there was no rain. The crops did not grow well. All the plants dried up. People did not have food to eat. Cassava and Palm decided to go to another village to look for work. On the way, they met a woman. ""Good afternoon,"" they greeted her. She answered and asked, ""Where are you going?"" ""We're going to the next village to look for work,"" said Palm. ""What work can you do?"" The woman asked. The friends answered, ""We can provide food for your family and your animals."" The woman asked, ""What do you need to provide food?"" ""Give us land, water and good care,"" they answered."
"An eclipse is an astronomical event. It is a process that develops slowly in time. The eclipse is when an object in the sky moves in the shadow of another object. When an eclipse occurs in a system of stars, like the solar system, it makes a type of syzygy. This means that three or more objects in the sky are aligned in a straight line in the same gravitational system. The term eclipse is most often used to describe a solar eclipse, when the shade of the Moon crosses the Earth's surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves in the shadow of the Earth. No solar eclipse can last more than 7 minutes and 58 seconds because of the speed at which the Earth and the Moon move. When the Sun is not involved, the event is called occultation."
"Carbohydrates are today our main nutrients. As its name says, they are essentially carbon atoms linked to hydrogen and also to oxygen atoms. Glucose is one of the simplest carbohydrates, known and has 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen and 6 oxygen. Many carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, lactose, etc.) are sweet, and for this reason they are also known as sugars. The second most important element for first human beings was probably proteins, and hunting/fishing wild animals was the best way to obtain proteins."
"Electronic engineering is a discipline that studies all kinds of situations related to electricity and magnetism. Electronic engineers are interested in processes such as: radio wave information transfer, electronic circuit design, computer system design, and the development of control systems such as automatic aircraft pilots and other embedded systems. The term electronic engineering began to emerge in the late 1950s. Prior to the Second World War, electronic engineering was commonly known as a ""radio engineer."" At that time, the study of radio engineering at a university was part of a physics degree."
It's the cat. It's the dog. The cat and the dog live in a house. A house with a door. A house with a roof. The cat and the dog have a ball. The ball is red and blue and green. The cat and the dog play with the ball. The cat throws the ball at the dog. The dog catches the ball. The dog throws the ball at the cat. The cat catches the ball. Then the cat throws the ball very high. Oh! Oh! The ball is on the roof. The ball is on the roof of the house. The cat and the dog can see the ball. The cat and the dog cannot go to the ball. The cat and the dog cry. Then Elephant passes. Elephant is big. Elephant can see the ball. Elephant can go to the ball. Elephant gets the ball from the roof of the house. Elephant takes the ball from the roof of the house. Elephant gives the ball to the cat and the dog.
"Cat and Dog look through the window. They look through the window. Then Cat and Dog see a butterfly! The butterfly is pink. Cat and Dog want to catch the butterfly. Cat and Dog follow the butterfly. They follow the butterfly. Cat and Dog follow the butterfly on foot. They walk after the butterfly. But the butterfly is fast. The butterfly is too fast, and Cat and Dog are slow. They are too slow. Cat and Dog follow the butterfly by car. They drive after the butterfly. But the butterfly is fast. The butterfly is fast. The butterfly is fast. The butterfly is very fast, Cat and Dog are slow. They are very slow. Cat and Dog follow the butterfly by car. They drive after the butterfly. But the butterfly is fast. The butterfly is still too fast, Cat and Dog are slow. They are still too slow. Cat and Dog follow the butterfly by boat. They float after the butterfly."
"The dog is in his house. The dog is sitting in his house. Then someone knocks on the door. The dog opens the door. The dog sees someone yellow! The dog asks, ""Who are you?"" Cat. The cat is yellow. The cat's head is yellow. The cat's hair is yellow. The cat's arms are yellow. The cat's hands are yellow. The cat's mouth is yellow. The cat's nose is yellow. The cat's ears are yellow. The dog asks, ""Why are you yellow?"" The cat says, ""I don't know."" The dog asks, ""Where were you?"" The cat says, ""I was in school."" The dog asks, ""What school?"" The cat says, ""I was in school in the village."" The dog asks, ""When were you in school?"" The cat said, ""I was in school this morning."""
"For the dog it is too cold. The cat gives dog underwear. A pair of underwear is dirty. A pair of underwear is clean. The dog takes clean underwear. But it is still too cold. The cat gives dog shirts. A shirt is big. A shirt is small. The dog takes the big shirt. But it is still too cold. The cat gives dog pants. A pair of pants is long. The dog takes the long pair of pants. But it is still too cold. The cat gives dog vests. A jacket is wet, a vest is dry. The dog takes the dry vest, but it is still too cold. The cat gives dog jackets. A jacket is thick, a jacket is thin. The dog takes the thick jacket, but it is still too cold. The cat gives dog hats. A hat is high, a hat is low. The dog takes the hat high, but it is still too cold. The cat gives dog shoes. A pair of shoes is new, a pair of shoes is old."
"Many things, such as the genes we got from our parents or the environment in which we grew up, make us unique and push us to behave differently. Although our brains are all built in the same way, each person's brain works a little differently. Some scientists think that the way chemical messages are sent in some parts of the brain makes it harder for some people to concentrate or wait, like children and adults with ADHD. They don't want to disturb their friends or make their teachers or parents crazy by not concentrating or waiting, but it's just a lot harder for them. Scientists think that many parts of the brain can be associated with ADHD symptoms. Just in the centre of the brain, there's a part called striatum – say ""strai-ay-tuhm."" This part of the brain becomes more active in response to fun, tasty or new experiences."
"Abel didn't have a driver for his new cart. He said to his sister Meri: ""I want a driver for my cart. Please give me your doll. She can sit in the cart."" But Meri said, ""No, I want my doll."" When Meri didn't want to let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. Meri pulled the other arm of the doll. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm went out! Meri cried and ran to her mother. ""Look at Mother,"" she said, ""Abel pulled my doll's arm and she went out. He wanted my doll to sit in her new cart, but I wanted to play with her."" Her mother said, ""Abel didn't behave well."" Mother thought to teach her son not to touch her sister's toys."
"Try this simple exercise: go to your music library, choose a song and play the first 3 seconds. Give yourself 1 point if you can sing or smell at least the next 5 seconds of this song. Do it for 20 songs. How many points have you scored? We wouldn't be surprised if it's more than 15. Now, think about what you've just done. You've made no effort to call the pitch, the rhythm, and maybe even the lyrics of more than 15 songs in a short period of time. That's a lot of data you've been able to call from your brain, just like that! Our brains have a remarkable ability to make, store and recover music memories, even when we're not aware of it. For example, if you hear a catchy song, you'll probably be able to remember parts of your life a few days later."
"Antibiotics are drugs that kill or prevent the growth of bacteria. However, the majority of microbes are harmless and really help maintain our health. The microbes of the skin, mouth and nose fight against the bad bacteria that want to enter the body to cause the disease. These good bacteria act as guardians that prevent harmful bacteria that make us sick. The bacteria that colonize the vagina are another example of good bacteria. They maintain an acidic environment in the vagina that prevents the growth of other microorganisms that could cause the disease. Pathogenic microorganisms are called pathogens. Even though most of the time they are harmless or even useful, under certain conditions, some bacteria that are part of the human microbiota can harm us."
"The clouds, whether they are large grey layers, soft white masses or striations in the sky coming from the planes, all have some points in common. Most importantly, they are made up of tiny droplets of water, called ""cloud droplets."" Cloudy droplets form when the warm air on the Earth's surface rises and cools slowly. Like particles, cloud droplets are so small that they do not fall to the ground (unless the cloud rains). The air rising around them pushes them upwards, gravity pulls them, and they end up floating just around the sky. In the sky, unless there is some kind of surface to stick to it, or unless it is really cold (-38°C), water exists in the form of gas."
"The word ""independence"" means not to depend on anyone or anything. It also means being strong and able to survive alone. Everything can be dependent or independent. When people talk about independence, it can be people or countries, which are often spoken of as a good thing. For places, it can mean sovereignty or autonomy. In science, as in the independent variable, the word does not mean that it is good or bad. A country gets independence when it is no longer part of another country. Sometimes, countries get independence in a war, as when the United States left the British Empire in the American war of independence."
"Neuroscientists, scientists who study the functioning of the brain, have been very interested in learning how memories are stored in the brain. However, neuroscientists have only recently begun to study oblivion. To understand how the human brain forgets, we can study how fruit flies forget. Fruit flies are great, small insects that are excellent for scientific research. They grow very quickly in the laboratory and we can produce as many flies as we want. Their genetic material, or DNA, is also very easy to change. DNA is a very long and thin chemical that contains instructions to build any living organism. DNA contains genes, which are sections of DNA that tell a cell how to make a protein. The instructions contained in the DNA of flies can be changed in the laboratory. The genes can be removed, making a mutating fly. In this way, we can explore what happens to a fly if part of these instructions are removed."
"No, it wasn't the beginning of a joke. Both have more in common than you might think. We often think of a corn plant as a single organism. But plants are part of a network of relationships, like Facebook. These plant relationships are easy to ignore because they are difficult to study. Yet, they are very important because they affect the health of plants. The soil is full of millions of microscopic bacteria and fungi. These microbes are collectively called microbes. Some of these microbes form close partnerships with plants. Plants can rely on microbes to help them get nutrients that are rare in the soil. Microbes break down dead plants and animals, and this process slowly releases nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements that plants need to grow. When plants cannot get enough of these nutrients by themselves, they can send sugars from their roots."
"Reflexes protect you and allow you to move without thinking about every action and response that your body needs to do. It is important that reflexes occur without having to think about them because there are things that happen to your body and forces that act in your body when you move that need to be reacted very quickly. Reflexes allow your body to react in a way that helps you to be safe, to stand up and to be active. Imagine a typical day. You might think about practicing your sport or music instrument, walking to school or making a snack. In all these actions, you think, but at the same time, there are also reflexes that you don't know to occur inside your body. These reflexes are built naturally in the body, and they exist at birth and change as we age. Reflexes are like safety features to survive that allow us to move in response to something in the environment."
"Pierre Latreille, a French zoologist, was the first to describe the kennel tick in 1806. A few decades later, German scientist Carl Ludwig Koch studied these ticks and, on the basis of some of their characteristics, he gave the scientific name of Rhipicéphalus sanguinus to this tick. These ticks still have the same scientific name today. Because the houses and kennels where dogs live can often be infested, often with a very high number of ticks, this tick is often called kennel tick. The kennel tick is the most common tick in the world, but it is particularly common in tropical and subtropical regions."
"His family began to starve. The hunt was their main source of food. One morning, he went to check his traps in the forest. He was lucky that day, one of his traps had caught a giraffe. He was very happy when he saw the giraffe. He celebrated that his family would get food. He said, ""Let me take the giraffe carefully without losing much of his blood."" ""Let me cut off the tendons of the ankle so that there is little blood."" He died slowly, with his spear directed towards the tendons of the ankle. To his disappointment, he missed the target. The spear cut the trap! The giraffe jumped and before she fled, the hunter caught the tail. He was dragged home. He was dragged through the forest. He finally let go from the tail."
"So, when you feel empathy, your brain generates this feeling by activating certain areas of the brain that are important for empathy. Research on empathy shows that one of the main areas of the brain that is activated when you see a friend in pain is an area that scientists call S1. This area of the brain is not only responsible for empathy, but it is also active when you suffer yourself. For example, if you hit your knee, the S1 area also activates. This is very interesting, because it means that the pain you actually feel in your body can be similar to the empathy you feel for a friend's pain. In other words, it may mean that when you see your friend in pain, your brain active as if you were yourself in pain."
"Imagine this: you are sitting in a classroom on a sunny day while your science teacher tells you enthusiastically what our brain is capable of doing. At first, you pay attention to what the teacher says. But the sound of words coming out of his mouth fades gradually when you notice that your stomach is grumbling and you start thinking about this delicious ice cream that you had last night. Have you ever taken the wandering mind? In similar situations, where your eyes are fixed on your teacher, your friends, or your parents, but your mind has secretly wandered about another moment and place? You could recall the last game of sports that you watched or fantasize about going to the new amusement park this weekend, or snoring your favorite air that you simply can't get out of your head. This experience is what scientists call wandering mind, which is a time when we are focused on things that aren't related to the current task or what actually happens around us."
"Each species has its different habits: a monkey jumps from branch to branch until it finds fruit to eat, a bat flies in the darkness of the night between the trees, a whale swims in the open ocean. Since the brain of these animals helps them to do all these tasks, we guess that their brains would be very different. But it turns out that the main parts of the brain and the connections to the brain are all quite identical for all mammals. This similarity in the structure of the brain exists because of the evolutionary history that all these brains share. In fact, if we put the brains of different mammals next to each other, the similarities are easy to spot. Even if the brains vary (many) in their size and in their folds, they all have the same parts. All these brains have a cerebral cortex, a cerebellum and a brain stem."
"You have probably heard that humans are mainly composed of water. So, why not collapse into puddles on the ground? It is because the human body is composed of all types of cells – skin cells (which are really flat), heart cells (which are beating – for real!), and brain cells (which transmit information), to name only a few. Cells have an important characteristic that prevents us from collapsing into puddles on the ground: they have an external membrane, composed of special fat molecules, which prevents the water from escaping! Inside the cells, there are more compartments of fat membranes called ""organs"" that all have their own important work. One of the most important organs is the nucleus. This is where genetic information in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is found."
"""Now it's enough to cook the cake!"" said Lynne. ""Oupa Karel sighed as he turned the pages of his recipe book. ""I'm not going to be much help,"" he said, shaking his head. ""I've never been good at cooking."" ""It's good, Oupa,"" said Lynne with a smile. ""Anton and I can do it. We just need to follow the recipe. How many of these ingredients should we use? ""We need 150 grams of flour,"" said Oupa Karel, drawing a finger on the list of ingredients. ""Fifty grams of cocoa, 220 grams of sugar, 80 grams of butter, two eggs and half a cup of milk."
"Little Jojo and Tata Rectangle looked everywhere, but they didn't find the spring horn. ""Go see if Mama Triangle has the spring horn,"" said Tata Rectangle. Little Jojo stopped at her house to pour a glass of cold water. Jojo visited Dudu Diamond and asked if she was going with him. ""It's not far away, but I'm going to take some food,"" said Dudu. Dudu and Jojo stopped to eat and rest at the bottom of the triangle mountain. When they were halfway up the mountain, they saw a strange spider web. Jojo and Dudu arrived at Mama Triangle's house. ""The chief didn't leave his spring horn here,"" said Mama Triangle. Mama Triangle knew where they could find the spring horn."
"DNA, as you may already know, is the genetic material of the cell. It contains instructions, in the form of genes, that provide the master plan for the creation of the organism. Studying specific genes is a good way for scientists to learn about microbial communities. For example, we can look at a gene called the 16S rRNA gene. The 16S rRNA gene tells us about the relationships of the microbes, and that is why it is called a ""phylogenetic"" marker gene. ""Phylogenetic"" is derived from Greek words meaning the origin of a tribe or family. There were also other marker genes used in this study, including genes coding for special proteins called enzymes, specific enzymes that are important in the use of sulfur for energy."
"Like any other part of your body, the spinal cord can be injured. Some people damage their spinal cord when they dive into a pool too shallow to dive, or even into a traffic accident. When the spinal cord is damaged, the brain's messages cannot move to the rest of the body. Therefore, after a spinal cord injury, the brain may no longer be able to send messages to the legs and the affected person may lose its ability to walk. A higher injury, where the spinal cord is damaged closer to the neck (at the cervical level), may cause even more serious problems and some people are left unable to move their arms."
"The hyena and the monkey had an argument, and they went to a judge to settle their disputes, and after the judge had listened to their case, he was afraid to judge their case. He said, ""If I condemn the hyena, she will eat all my cattle. And if I condemn the monkey, he will eat all my corn! So what should I do?"" The judge thought for a moment, and said, ""The matter is too difficult for me to judge alone. You should go to the elders of the village."" So the hyena and the monkey went to the elders. They told the elders about their disagreement. After the elders had listened to their case, they were also afraid to make judgment. If they supported the monkey, the hyena could eat their cattle. If they supported the hyena, the monkey could eat their corn. The elders told Hyena and Monkey that their affair was very difficult. Suddenly, the elders remembered a poor woman in the city. She had nothing to lose, no cattle or corn."
"To understand the mechanism behind reading emotions, think of the human face. Have you ever heard the saying ""The eyes are the windows of the soul""? Perhaps it is a little unlikely to see someone's soul through their eyes (our eyes are not real windows after all), but one of the reasons why people use this saying is because the eyes are very important to understand what others feel. In fact, we can learn a lot about others from their facial expressions, and other people can tell a lot about us from our faces. Think of all the ways you can express emotions using your face! Even babies seem to be born to understand the importance of faces, because as early as 9 minutes after birth, babies prefer to look at faces rather than all other objects."
"Tuberculosis (TB) is a very important public health problem. It is estimated that in 2014, 9.6 million people developed tuberculosis, and nearly 2 million people died of this disease, where India, Indonesia and China reported almost half of the cases occurring in the world. Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis that spreads from person to person in the air, when a person with the disease coughs, speaks or sneezes. It is estimated that one third of people infected with this bacterium do not fall ill, but still have the bacteria hidden in their bodies, what doctors call a latent (or dormant) state. There is currently only one vaccine approved for tuberculosis in humans, called Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). This vaccine has been administered to more than 3 billion people since its development in 1921, with about 115 million doses per year to newborns."
"The sea level has changed naturally in the past, mainly due to the growth and melting of large ice caps during ice age. During the peak of the last glacial period (~20 000 years), sea level was ~120 m lower than it is today. Due to the global warming that occurred between 20,000 and 10,000 years (which was natural and not influenced by humans), the rate of sea level rise was 1.2 cm per year for 10,000 years, until it stabilized to zero."
"The pareidolia face (by-i-DOH-lee-a) is when we see faces in objects that do not actually have real faces. How can we see an object coming to life with a face? When the brain gets the message from the eyes with information about what they see, the message is sent to the occipital lobe, the part of the back of the brain that deals with vision. When the message arrives in the occipital lobe, it is not yet organized into a face. Instead, the message consists of information such as patterns of light and darkness as well as edges. A process begins that is like an assembly chain that builds the face, where parts of the face are put together through the occipital lobe. As the assembly line ends through the occipital lobe, it carries the parts of the face that are built to another brain zone, the temporal lobes, which are located behind the ears."
"In a normal cell, if there is damage to DNA, it is fixed by DNA repair and maintenance systems. However, if a cell or organ is continuously exposed to a chemical or metal compound that has the ability to damage DNA, then the damage to DNA becomes excessive. Excessive or continuous damage to DNA is risky because the following things could happen. Some of the damage can be left unrepaired, resulting in changes in DNA information or if such damage occurs in areas of DNA where the repair genes are located, the repair system could become either defective or overactive."
"Eric Mamajek is a professor at the University of Rochester in the United States. He and his graduate student, Mark Pecaut, looked at a lot of data on star light in the SuperWASP database. Eric and Mark are both experts in the search for very young stars, and two signs of a young star are (i) they have many star spots that look like black spots on their surface and are cooler regions on the star and (ii) they spin faster than the older stars. Our Sun takes about 25 days to turn around once, but the young stars only take 2–3 days to spin around. As very young stars revolve around, the star spots on their surface come and out of sight, and this changes their light level to a small amount. Looking at the light given by these young stars, Eric and Mark can see the light change by a small amount repeatable every time the stars spin around, and the SuperWASP database was an ideal place to look for evidence of new stars."
"A neuron has three main parts, the cell body, an axon and the dendrites. The trunk of the tree (cell body) stores genetic information (DNA) in a compartment called the nucleus. The cell body also contains the chemical machine to produce the neurotransmitters that the neuron uses to communicate with each other. The branches of the tree (dendrite, the word dedron comes from the Greek language and actually means ""tree"") are the parts of a neuron that receive signals. In the past, it was thought that the dendrites were like antennas, simply receiving signals from other neurons, but, as I explain, they can do more than that. The root of the tree (axon) is the structure used by a neuron to connect with another neuron and talk about it to another neuron. An axon carries information similar to a cable that transports electricity. When a neuron wants to share a message with another, it sends an electrical impulse, called an action potential, until it reaches the terminal of the axis."
"While Johnson was working on math issues with other female computers, she was asking questions. She didn't just want to do the work — she wanted to know the ""how"" and ""why"" and then the ""why not."" In asking questions, Johnson began to stand out. Women were not allowed to attend meetings with male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her geometry training and began working with teams made up of men. Finally, she was recognized as a leader, and men leaned more and more on her to get the answers they needed. In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly afterwards, Johnson became a member of the space team."
"Although the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments prohibit slavery, provide for equal protection under the law, guarantee citizenship and protect the right to vote, individual states continue to allow the unfair treatment of minorities and adopt laws of Jim Crow authorizing the segregation of public institutions, which were confirmed by the Supreme Court in the Plessy v. Ferguson case (1895), which held that State laws requiring racial segregation that were ""separate but equal"" were constitutional, which contributed to the continuation of legalized discrimination well during the 20th century. After the Second World War, pressures to recognize, challenge and change inequalities for minorities increased."
"Non-alphabetical spellings represent either the syllable (Tcherokee, Tamil, or Japanese Kana) or a unit of unique meaning (as in Chinese, Japanese Kanji) with each symbol. Like alphabetical spellings, a unit of spoken language is represented by a symbol, but in non-alphabetical spellings, unlike alphabetical spellings, this unit of spoken language is greater than a simple phoneme. Chinese is often called a pictograph (a language composed of images), because people think that the characters are images of the words they represent. In fact, very few Chinese characters are actually images of the words they represent. In Chinese, symbols represent rather a unit of pronunciation (a syllable) which is also a unit of meaning (a morphema), so Chinese is considered as a morpho-syllabic writing system. Approximately 80-90% of Chinese characters also contain what is called a phonetic radical."
"Your skin cells continue to divide, they die and give birth to new cells all the time, even when you are not injured. After an injury, the skin makes a pile of new cells and uses them to heal your wound. Yet, the nerve cells in your brain, also called neurons, do not renew themselves. They do not divide at all. There are very few exceptions to this rule – only two special places in the brain can give rise to new neurons. For the most part, however, the brain cannot reconstruct the dead neurons. This is particularly worrying because the neurons are very sensitive cells and they die for all kinds of reasons. When you work the head and suffer from a concussion, the neurons die. When there is a stain in the blood supply of the brain, also called a stroke, the neurons die. Neurons also die in the face of changes in their own functions, which occurs in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease."
"Imagine that you are 7 years old and you need to read four sentences of a book to do your homework. The first two sentences are on a page full of text, while the other two sentences appear on their own on the next page, without any other text around them. What sentences do you think you read faster and less effort? Does your older sister, who is 11 years old, read these sentences more quickly than you? What about your father? Now imagine that you are doing your homework in a different situation. First, you are doing your homework on the table where you have other notebooks with words written on them in large print. Would you distract yourself from looking at the notebooks? Then, your mother puts a children's program on the radio and they sing the alphabet—you hear the speakers say ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", and other letters. Are you more distracted by this than you were by the notebooks? What sentences do you read more slowly — those who are alone on the page or those surrounded by other texts? Can you think of any more problems than your father or your sister?"
"While Dande wondered how to punish Madola, a small black venomous snake entered one of the unnoticed gourdes. Then, Dande sealed the gourdes and left. Dande gave Madola a gourd waiting for her salary. After tasting, Madola said, ""Bring me another gourd and I'll pay you."" Dande ran for her. Dande brought the second gourd. He gave it to Madola saying, ""Here's another gourd of sweet honey like the last. Pay me now."" Madola took the gourd but said in a crafty way, ""There is no pay today."" Dande was angry. Madola wanted to eat honey. He put his finger in the gourd and was bitten. He cried, ""I am bitten! Help!"" The missing snake unnoticed."
"The next day, he began to build a huge complex to entertain his friend. As soon as the complex was finished, he asked the water to come and visit them. When the water arrived, he asked the sun if she would be sure to enter. ""Yes, come in, my friend,"" the sun answered. The water began to flow. He was accompanied by crocodiles, fish, frogs, snakes, snails, snakes, turtles and all aquatic animals. Very quickly the water was deep in the knee. He asked the sun if it was still safe. ""Yes,"" replied the sun."
"The drum has always been an important instrument of music in our community. We love drums! We have drums of different sizes: large, medium and small. We play with drummers, or with our fingers. We play with drums for various reasons. We play with drums with songs and dances, for parties and in bad weather. The drums enrich the songs and make people want to dance. The drums do colorful ceremonies. We play with drums during the wedding ceremonies and the first names of the children. We play with drums during the celebration of a new harvest or a twin birth. We sound with drums to announce grief and call people when death occurs."
"Our research project was inspired by a science fiction story of a book by Philip K. Dick called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" (1968), which was then transformed into a film called ""Blade Runner"" (1982). The story takes place in 2019, when androids made of artificial flesh, bones and brains became so similar to humans that they could no longer be recognized as ""machines."" A detection device had to be used to find the only difference between androids and humans: the fact that only humans could have deep emotions, really care for someone else, and live what the other person feels – what we call empathy. Empathic emotions such as affection are very important to humans, because the ability to build and maintain connections with others is critical to our well-being and survival. These empathic emotions are important for things such as love relationships, caring for a mother for her children, team spirit, or even helping one thing, or even a friend."
"The development of antibiotics is one of the greatest successes of modern medicine. Antibiotics have saved millions of lives since doctors began to use them in the 1940s. Antibiotics have helped humans to have a much better life by successfully treating almost all types of bacterial infections. But like us, bacteria are smart too! Since the 1940s, bacteria have developed tactics to overcome the effects of antibiotics, and today we see more and more bacteria that can no longer be killed by antibiotics."
"Our immune systems try to protect us from the disease by recognizing foreign molecules, such as those found on bacteria or viruses, without reacting to our own molecules. Bacteria and viruses that cause infection are known as pathogens. When your cells are infected with a pathogen, the pathogen will begin to reproduce by making copies of its DNA or RNA (cell instructions) and will also produce many molecules that fight the defense mechanisms of your immune system. The DNA of the pathogen and the molecules it produces are alien to our human cells and, therefore, act as a signal of ""danger"" indicating that something is wrong with the infected cell. This danger signal makes phosphatidylserine exposed to the surface of the infected cell to attract macrophages."
"Droughts can be reported after as little as 15 days without rain and can continue indefinitely. The longest drought in history has lasted 400 years in the Atacama Desert in Chile. However, most modern droughts are not so severe. In the United States, the National Drought Mitigation Centre finds only the Panhandle of Oklahoma and northern Georgia experiencing ""extreme drought."" California experienced a severe drought between 2012 and 2017, while Florida experienced a severe drought between 2006-2007 and 2017. Droughts are considered serious when water shortages become frequent and extreme when large crop losses occur. At the global level, the Centre shows that there is ""extreme drought"" in the Middle East and East of Australia and ""serious drought"" in parts of North Africa. Droughts are a natural process that has occurred throughout history."
"In 1969, four computers were successfully connected to ARPANET, creating a computer network. Things progressed quickly after that. More and more computers were added to ARPANET, and in 1972 computer scientists began to develop applications that were working on the network. One of these applications was e-mail, called e-mail at the time. Another of the developed applications, although later than e-mail, was the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and it is the application used to create and view websites. It is also the source of the www. prefixe of Web addresses. The World Wide Web is one of the main tools with which Internet users interact. The World Wide Web allowed the exchange of web pages."
"After the fall of the Roman Empire, the people launched crusades and built cathedrals. But in the Middle Ages, Christianity had only been present in Europe for a few centuries. Before that, paganism dominated the continent. Because of the way in which Christianity spread, especially in Northern Europe, Europe's intense belief in Christianity was supported and informed by local legends of paganism. At the time, Christians in Europe saw any religion that was not Christianity, Islam or Judaism as a pagan religion. Although paganism, by definition, encompasses many different religions, most of the religions that existed in pre-Christian Europe had some common attributes. These religions were incredibly local, often polytheistic, did not focus on individual choice or power, and were strongly related to nature."
"The warmest areas of the Earth are often near volcanoes on the surface of the Earth and in the depth of the oceans. The Mid-Atlantic ridge is an underwater ridge and the boundary between huge rocky plaques along the soil of the Atlantic Ocean. These rocky plaques are called tectonic plaques, and they are so huge that the North American plaque is located under Cuba, the United States, Canada and Greenland, while the Eurasian plaque is located under Europe and most of Asia. In several places, beautiful volcanic islands have appeared from the bottom of the ocean after a very long period of time. A group of these volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean is called the Azores. The Azores are located almost halfway between the United States and Portugal, while Iceland is in the north between Greenland and Norway. These islands are covered with hot springs."
"This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as an energy store. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets. Pasta, potatoes, bread and other starchy foods are made from carbohydrates. Some good food sources of starch are cereals, bread, potatoes, cereals, peas and beans. Starch is also used to thicken sauces in the kitchen. It is a white powder that is tasteless and odourless. It can also be used to thicken cold foods when they are precooked. Foods with lots of starch produce more energy than other foods. However, if this energy is not used, it is transformed into fat by our livers. There are also different types of starch, such as washing starch, which gives clothing a smooth and crispy sensation."
"Memory is a very important subject, and researchers divide the subject of memory to make it easier to study. There is long-term memory, short-term memory and working memory. Long-term memory allows you to remember information for a certain time – for a few minutes, or for your whole life. For example, if you are divided into groups and you receive a number, you will remember your group number for the whole activity. Or, you will remember your name for a whole life. Short-term memory stores immediate information and is deleted in less than a minute. For example, if someone tells you a phone number and you dial it immediately and then you forget it. It is more difficult to dial a phone number if someone tells you all the phone number at once, instead of telling you the number in bits and pieces. When you work with short-term memory, it is called working memory. For example, when you read a sentence, you need to remember the first words of the sentence until the end of the sentence."
"Social exclusion refers to the experience of being socially isolated, physically (for example, totally alone), or emotionally (for example, being ignored or saying that one is undesirable). When someone excludes you, you probably feel bad or even feel ""painful."" Why does social exclusion cause these feelings? One possibility is that human beings are social animals, and we have been chosen by evolution to live together with others. Social exclusion tells us that social relations are threatened or damaged, and therefore exclusion tells us that there is a crisis, causing perverse feelings."
"We have also learned that in order to overestimate the size of an object, this object must make the person feel fearful and deplorable on a daily basis. We have demonstrated in this work that negative emotions (fear and deplorable) overestimate the size of people. But what about positive emotions? Some studies have found that positive emotions could also change the estimation of size. For example, expert golf players believe that the physical size of the hole in which the ball is hit is greater than non-expert players think the hole is. The next question to ask is what are the causes? Some people have an image of a big spider in their minds and that is why they are afraid of spiders? Or are they afraid of spiders because when they see one, they see it as bigger than it really is? This question requires further study."
"In this example, the type of plant, the age and the size of the plant at the beginning of the experiment are variables that we want to keep. Then, we would divide the plants into two groups by numbering them and randomly drawing the numbers. The first 10 plants would enter our treatment group – the plants that receive plant food. The other 10 plants will enter what we call our control group – they are the plants that do not get plant food. This method of assigning things to the groups is called randomization, and it ensures that each plant involved in our study has an equal chance of being chosen for each group. This is the best way to ensure that the groups are as equal as possible. Then, for a month, we give the plant food to the treatment group but not to the control group. All the other variables are maintained exactly the same – the plants get the same amount of sun, the same environment and the same water."
"In fact, the first vice-president of the nation, John Adams, called this position ""the most insignificant function ever invented by man."" The president, then, has almost total control over what the vice-president does. If he chooses to entrust him with many responsibilities, the vice-president can have an important power. But the president must be prepared to delegate this power to the vice-president. In recent years, the presidents have given their vice-presidents more and more to do. They have directed commissions and organized important projects. The vice-president often does missions of goodwill and attend ceremonies and celebrations. If the president regularly asks for advice, then the vice-president has real, though indirect, power."
"Most people know that physical activity is important to their physical health. People who are more physically active have a lower risk of getting sick (e.g. developing heart disease), they tend to live longer and they have a better quality of life. As a result, an average of at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day is recommended for children and adolescents. Unfortunately, fewer and fewer children and adolescents get the recommended amount of exercise — sedentary behaviour (besieged or inactive) is increasing, especially in developed countries. Lack of exercise is not only a concern because physical exercise is good for physical health, but because there is a link between physical activity and the human brain."
"One of the first steps of the scientific method is to establish a hypothesis, or just a hypothesis or an informed prediction on the way/why something happens. The prediction must be tested by experiments or observations to see if this hypothesis is correct or false. For example, a famous hypothesis is that the speed at which an object falls to the ground does not depend on the mass of this object. This hypothesis predicts that if you dropped a hammer and feather of the same height at the same time in the vacuum (without resistance to the air), then they should strike the ground at the same time. To test this, an astronaut actually tried to drop a hammer and feather while standing on the Moon (which has no air), and he showed that the hammer and feather really touched the ground at the same time. This is proof that the hypothesis was true. Even if astronomers do not understand exactly what the black matter is, over the years they have had a lot of ideas."
"The sound is sounded through the outside of the ear, which is called pinna, in the ear canal. These two parts are called the outer ear. The sound then vibrates the drum of the ear, which in turn puts the osicles (a set of three small bones in the middle ear) in motion. This movement of the osicles creates waves in the fluid of the snail-shaped cochlea. The cochlea is located deep inside, in an area called the inner ear. The cochlea is the place where the sound energy is converted into electric impulses by thousands of tiny hair cells. The auditory nerve transmits this information to the brain, where the details of the sound such as its characteristics, sounds, sounds and directions, are then understood, so that the boy recognizes the sound of the motor as a car approaching him. It is a rapid process that occurs in less than a second. The speed of the hearing process allows the boy to react quickly."
"Long ago, in the land of the Zulu people, King Jama ka Ndaba was very powerful, wise, just and kind. But he had no children and feared that he had no heir. He prayed and made offerings to the gods, but nothing happened. One evening, while the king was asleep, a witch came into a dream. ""The gods heard your plea and the queen will carry twins. One will govern the Zulu nation and the other will have magical powers,"" said the witch. Mkabayi and Mammama twins were born but the queen wept for Mkabayi because the rule said that the first twin must be offered to the gods."
"One of the best ways scientists have found to study impulsiveness is to perform an experiment called a marshmallow test. In the marshmallow test, a child is brought into a room with a single marshmallow on a plate. The child sits in front of the marshmallow and says, ""If this marshmallow is still here in 20 minutes, I will give you two marshmallows. But if you eat this marshmallow now, you will not have the second marshmallow."" Then, the scientist leaves the room, leaving the child alone with the marshmallow. Most of the children spend their time desperately not eating the marshmallow, looking away, closing their eyes, smelling it, but not tasting it, trying not to touch it or thinking about it. Just as with the examples of impulsiveness discussed at the beginning of this article, there are two selves in these children—one wants to eat the marshmallow now, and the other wants to wait for two marshmallows."
"If we want to see if children learn new words by hearing a book, there are different ways to do it. We would of course read them a story and measure the number of words from the story they know. But is it really that simple? How would we know that children did not already know those words before they heard the stories? We have a really fun solution: we write our own history books so that we can put special words in them! These special words are called ""target words."" The special words we use are invented words like ""sprock"" and ""manu."" They sound like real words but we invent them. In this way we can know that children do not already know the words before we read the stories. Many studies use words made like these for the same reason."
"One day, on the riverside, the dog met eggs in the sand. He asked himself, ""What animal had left these eggs here?"" He counted ten eggs and thought they could belong to Duck. He put them in his bag. He took the eggs home and put them in a warm place. When the dog returned to the river, he met Crocodile. She asked, ""Have you seen my eggs?"" ""I don't know anything about your eggs,"" he replied. Crocodile began to visit all the animals that asked for eggs. Meanwhile, the eggs hatched one by one. The dog did his best to take care of the small crocodiles, but there was never enough food. The young crocodiles were always hungry. One day Crocodile went to the dog's house looking for his eggs."
"A long time ago, Hyena and Hare were great friends. They were both poor but Hare owned a donkey. He also had a very small pond, which he used to feed the donkey. A warm afternoon, Hare decided to give water to his donkey. However, Hare could not get water from the well with his small pond. So he decided to borrow a larger basin in Hyena. Hyena gave Hare his basin because of their friendship. After receiving water and giving it to the donkey, Hare returned home with Hyena's basin. Two weeks later, Hyena wanted to wash clothes but Hare still had her basin. Hyena left the clothes and went to Hare's house for her basin. Hare also gave Hyena her large basin. Hare said: ""Your basin gave birth to a young man and since we are friends, I give them both to you."" Hyena was happy and accepted both basins."
"Anticipation is a way to reduce the stress of a difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be and preparing for it. Some literary critics believe that this is the reason why people like to read, watch and analyze tragedies. Thinking about tragic events helps people prepare for unexpected difficult circumstances. Finding emotional support from others or asking for help can be an instrumental way to maintain emotional health for a difficult period. Brain response to anxiety improves the effectiveness of this strategy. Stress releases neurohormone that enhances your ability to seek emotional support by increasing empathy and encouraging you to seek close social ties. Problem solving focuses on the location of the source of the problem and the determination of solutions, or action measures. Developing a plan can help alleviate stress that comes from the unknown. Problem solving can be strengthened by creativity, and it is a useful response to simple and complex questions."
"Feedback signals are used all the time to adapt our behavior. They can also be very useful when some parts of your body do not work well. When this happens, a doctor can use a small machine to help broken body parts do their work, and a feedback signal can be used to tell the machine when to work. This way, the machine and feedback signal can work together with the rest of your body to make sure everything works properly. Have you heard about a ""pacemaker"" for a heart? This is a small machine that doctors use to help someone whose heart does not work properly. If you put your ear on your parent's chest, you can hear their heartbeat."
"When Elephant asked what he was, Hare said it was from his wound. They reached a river and found a big buffalo of drinking water. Hare wanted to know who was stronger, Buffalo or Elephant. They started arguing. Elephant said she was stronger and Buffalo said she was stronger. Hare said he had an idea of how to find who was stronger. He asked them to wait for her there. Hare came back with a long rope. He tied one of the ends around the size of Elephant and took her away from the river. Hare tied the other end of the rope around Buffalo's size and left her near the river. Hare ran away and hid in a tree. He yelled, ""Reidy! one, two, three! Pull!"" Buffalo and Elephant fired. Elephant fired Buffalo. Buffalo fired Elephant Buffalo. He couldn't eat it. He couldn't eat it. He continued to eat it. He couldn't eat it."
A seismic valve (or a seismic valve) is an automatic method to stop the supply of low-pressure gas to a structure during a major earthquake and/or in the event of a pipe failure.It applies both to natural gas supplied by the utilities and to gas from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).These small devices are installed on the property's gas counter (usually between the facility measured by the utility company and the piping of the structure) and are designed to immediately stop the supply of natural gas to protect the structure if a gas leak or a line break occurs during an earthquake.
"One day, the son of the hyena died. One donkey heard the news. He ran to his parents and said, ""The son of the hyena is dead."" All the other donkeys said, ""The son of the hyena? That's good news. All the hyenas are our enemies."" An old donkey said, ""Brothers, we must go to the funeral of the hyena and show respect."" ""What? Go to the funeral of the hyena? The other donkeys said, ""We don't want to go there. We are afraid. The hyenas will eat us. ""Listen,"" said the old donkey. ""If we don't go, the hyenas will be angry with us. They will have a reason to eat us."" ""You are right,"" said all the other donkeys. ""We must go to the funeral of the hyena. If we go, the hyenas will be happy with us."
"One day, Jackal felt sick. He tried to drink water, but it inflated his stomach. He tried to eat grass but he still had a stomach pain. Jackal decided that only the man's medicine would help him as he dragged himself to the city clinic. ""At wwwh"" said the nurse when she saw the jackal dreaded, ""this place is for the sick, not for the animals. Go away!"" Now Jackal was an intelligent animal, so sick that he was, he made a plan. He asked a boy called Ernst who was sitting outside the clinic, to help him by taking the nurse's medication. ""If you do this for me, I'll give you a big fresh bird to cook you, every day."" Ernst was hungry and anyway, he was sorry for the sick jackal, with his moustaches and tail hanging like a rag, then he entered and got the medicine and his ears up immediately to the jackal."
"Zonke is very hot. Fortunately, the house is not far away. Suddenly, he notices something on the road. He stops. What is it? He is as big as the palm of his hand. He is brown. And he is made of leather. It is a wallet! Zonke can't believe his luck. He quickly looks inside the wallet. Wow, it contains money! Zonke's heart beats faster. Then he puts the wallet in his pocket. He quickly looks around to see if anyone has noticed. Yes! Someone approaches. It's Bheka. It's only a few steps behind Zonke. Zonke screams on. He hopes Bheka didn't see it. He doesn't want to take a look at his shoulder. The wallet is safely in his pocket. When he comes in, he will come out and see how much money it contains."
"The mobile rings of Ammi. Basha sees that Ammi's best friend, Saira aunte, calls and answers quickly. He doesn't want to wake up Ammi. ""I'm going home from a wedding with a lot of friends,"" says Saira aunte. ""She looks exhausted."" We'll be at your house in about two hours. Do you think we can have dinner at your house? There are 24 of us - and 4 are vegetarians."" Basha knows that Ammi would love to see them. He and Sainabi love Saira's aunt too. ""You're welcome,"" said Basha. ""He's excited that he's hanging up the phone. It's his chance to cook a dish alone! But will he be able to do it? He feels nervous. He opens the fridge and sees a lot of his favorite vegetables - cauliflower, peas, beans."
"As soon as he laid his feet on the street of Amsterdam, he felt a very jovial mood. He said to himself: ""Decidally, the air of Paris does not look like any other air. There is something indefinable stimulating, exciting, intoxicating, which fills you with a strange desire to dance and do many other things. As soon as I arrive here, it seems to me, all of a sudden, that I have taken a bottle of champagne. What a life one can lead in this city in the midst of artists! Happy are the elected, the great men who make a reputation in such a city! What a existence is theirs!"" And he made plans; he would have liked to know some of these famous men, talk about it to Vernon, and spend an evening with them from time to time in Paris. But suddenly an idea struck him."
"Maria wants to climb the coconut tree. Naomi doesn't want to climb the coconut tree. ""It's dangerous!"" she says. Maria asks, ""Let's go up the mango?"" Naomi answers, ""I'm afraid. There could be a snake."" Maria laughs: ""There are no snakes in the mango. Let's go up."" Then the two girls climb the tree. The two girls are in the mango tree. Then they hear a noise, Ssssss. Maria is surprised. ""A snake! Let's run, she weeps. Maria and Naomi have such a fear that they fell from the mango. The girls run. The snake could bite! Naomi asks, ""Mother, please kill the snake!"" Mother explains, ""The snakes only bite when they are afraid. There are dangerous snakes and others are harmless."" Mother wants to know what the snake looks like. Maria and Naomi draw and explain. Mother tells the girls that this snake eats rats."
"Have you ever seen a herd of cows in the field? From time to time, you will notice a cow shaking her head. She tries to hunt the flies that trample her. But why the zoom-zoom-zee flies around Cow's head? They say it started a long time ago in a distant country. The queen of the country was very rich and had a nice heart. One day she decided to organize a large banquet. All the animals were invited. The huge tables were beautifully loaded. Each table was moaning under the delights, meaty dishes, freshly cooked bread, steamed vegetables and sweet fruit."
"Ape meets Crocodile near the lake. ""Where do you live?"" Ape asks, ""In the lake,"" says Crocodile. ""Where do you live?"" asks Crocodile. ""In the trees,"" says Ape. ""Can you swim?"" asks Crocodile. ""I can't swim,"" says Ape. ""I can teach you."" ""We are friends. Don't be afraid,"" said Crocodile. ""Ape, my uncle is sick. He needs meat,"" said Crocodile. ""Ape is very afraid. Will Crocodile eat her? Ape wants to escape from Crocodile. Ape has an idea. ""I will give you my heart for him,"" promises Ape. ""My heart is in a tree on the earth,"" said Ape. ""Will you go and get your heart?"" asks Crocodile. ""Yes,"" said Ape. Crocodile swimming towards the land."
"Vusi looked at the picture and replied quickly: ""Heptagon has seven sides!"" Khosi added: ""Yes, remember that our teacher told us that Hepta means ""seven."" ""Oh, my wife, can you see how smart our children are? Ok, and about Deca, what does that mean?"" asked Dad. ""Ten! Ten!"" shouted Vussi and Khosi together. ""Yes, that's why one of your cousins is called Decagon, but he doesn't come because he has to represent the swimming team. There are so few Decagons at their school,"" said Mom. Then the kids asked, ""Mom and Dad, can we invite our friend Circle next door?"" Their parents agreed that Circle was welcome to join the family reunion."
"It's almost time for a break at the primary school in Siyafunda. The two spaza shop owners at school prepare lunch to sell to hungry children. In Mr. Motaung's shop, the bread is cut and ready to make kotas. He carefully cuts the soft middle of each quarter of bread. Then, he puts polonia and chips in the space inside. Motaung puts two spoons of his wife's house atchar in each kota. He likes to boast that his kotas have atchar inside and atchar above! In Mr. Mkhize's shop, the chips are almost ready, but he still cuts his bread for kotas. He's worried because things don't go well with his shop. ""He's started well,"" thinks Mkhize. ""But now I get fewer and fewer customers."
"Leopard always tried to catch Antelope. And Antelope always escaped from Leopard. One day Leopard called Antelope, ""Let's be friends. What you eat, I don't eat. Nothing makes us enemies."" Antelope accepted. So Leopard said, ""Let's make an oath to be friends. If one of us breaks the oath, his child will die."" They made an oath to be friends. At night, Antelope slept under a tree. Leopard slept in the above branches. Antelope quickly grew up. Leopard became thin. Leopard was tempted to eat the fat Antelope. She said, ""I don't care about the oath. I don't even have a child!"" Leopard jumped to catch Antelope. But she got caught between two branches. Antelope was shocked."
"A few months later, Meseret wanted to build a new cabin. He thought, ""I'm going to burn my old cabin and build a big new one."" Meseret started taking everything away from his cabin. Demeke saw it and asked, ""What are you doing?"" Meseret replied, ""I'm going to burn my cabin and build a new one."" Demeke was worried, ""But your cabin is next to mine. If you burn your cabin, you'll burn mine too."" Meseret was angry. ""Don't stop! It's my cabin, and I'll burn it if I want to."" He said. ""Stop! Let's go ask the judge."" Demeke exclaimed. The imprudent judge didn't listen carefully and didn't try to understand. ""Let Meseret burn his cabin because it's his cabin and no one can stop it."""
"There was once a man who had three sons. The youngest son was the smartest and his father loved him the most. Then the man realized that his other two sons were jealous. And when the father died, he left all his cattle to his two eldest sons. He left only one ox for the youngest son. But the brothers were still jealous of him. One day they said, ""We must slaughter your ox."" He was the youngest so that he could not protest. He said, ""If it should be so, I can't do anything. But please give me the skin."" When they slaughtered the ox, he took the skin. After drying, he climbed with a tree. As he was obscured, a group of merchants came to sleep under the tree. In the middle of the night, the young man began to beat the skin with a stick."
"The transatlantic flight of Charles ""Lucky Lindy"" Lindbergh, in 1927, made it an instant global hero, but even less osedevils won a short fame. A Texan won a $500 bet by pushing, in 22 days, a peanut with its nose on the peak of 14,400 feet high. A housewife from Louisville won a $200 prize for listening to a radio station for 106 hours without falling asleep (She had to be hospitalized for a combination of delirium and exhaustion). In no state of mind to worry if the good times would last, the Americans were happy to spend money they had to save due to the wartime shortages, and there was a plethora of new wonderful products to buy."
"Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. was the main pioneer who gave his name to the progressive era. Famous for his intense lifestyle, his exuberant personality, our 26th president was a statesman honoured by the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating a treaty that ended the Russo-Japanese war; an 18-book writer (including a four-volume story entitled The Winning of the West), a warrior who, in the Hispano-American War, led the legendary Rough Riders charge on the San Juan Hill in Cuba; and a naturalist scientist who explored remote areas of South America and Africa. But Roosevelt was the greatest contender of lasting fame, his bold leadership as the youngest president of the United States. Deeply conscious and furious of the greed and deceptive practices of the great entrepreneurs, Roosevelt pulled his first dam to what was then called the ""fearing barons"" shortly after his inauguration in 1901."
"Sometimes bacteria swim or float freely in liquids – in the water of your tap, in the juice left sitting on the counter, or, if a person has a blood infection, even in human blood. Swimming allows bacteria to move around to find food, or to get away from things they don't like, such as sunlight, or human body cells that want to eat bacteria. But, most bacteria would rather sit around than swim around. Sitting even less energy, and bacteria sitting in the right place can wait for food to come to them. Sitting is the first step in making a bacterial biofilm. The first bacterium that is sitting still may still be joined by others, or it could reproduce and make many more bacteria that are copies of itself. When more and more bacteria come together, they begin to make sticking substances called extracellular polymers that they cover."
"One day he called his sons and said, ""I am old and I will die soon. But before I die, I want to see you in your own houses. You have a month for each one to make your own house. I want to see you here after the month."" The two sons rushed. The first went to the side of the road. He cut trees and began to build a great complex for himself. The second, however, went out and began to establish special relations with other families. He went to different people, and he became like their foster child. After a month, the two brothers returned to their father. The father said, ""Well, did you build your houses?"" And the two brothers said, ""Yes."" The father went with his eldest son. He saw that the son had built many huts."
"In 1943 and 1944, the government assembled a combat unit of the Japanese Americans for the European theatre. He became the regimental combat team 442d and became famous as the highest decoration of the Second World War. Their military record reflected their patriotism. The war ended, the resettlement centres were slowly evacuated. While some people of Japanese descent returned to their home cities, others sought a new environment. For example, the Japanese American community in Tacoma, Washington, had been sent to three different centers; only 30 percent returned to Tacoma after the war. The Japanese Americans of Fresno had visited Manzanar; 80 percent returned to their home town. The internment of people of Japanese descent during the Second World War had triggered a constitutional and political debate."
"On June 16, 1897, McKinley and three representatives of the Government of the Republic of Hawaii -- Lorrin Thurston, Francis Hatch and William Kinney -- signed an annexation treaty. President McKinley then submitted the treaty to the United States Senate for ratification. Hui Aloha Aina for Women and Hui Aloha Aina for Men had now organized a petition campaign, hoping that if the United States government realized that the majority of the indigenous Hawaiian citizens were opposed to annexation, the annexation would be interrupted. Between September 11 and October 2, 1897, the two groups collected signatures of petitions at public meetings held on each of the five major Hawaiian islands. The petition, clearly marked ""Petition Against Annexation"" and written in the two Hawaiian and English languages, was signed by 21,269 Hawaiian residents, more than half of Hawaiian inhabitants."
"Kadogo and Juma are friends who like to run. They run together every day. One day they read cards at school. Juma said, ""Let's run across our continent. The race, together with Africans from many countries!"" ""Come on, we can do it! African unity!"" applauded Kadogo. They decided to carry a torch of unity on their journey. They lit the torch and started running. The race started at the southern tip of our continent, in Cape Town, South Africa. From South Africa they headed along the west coast. They ran through Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo and Cameroon. The runners quickly joined them from these countries. The growing group of people resting in Nigeria, in Abuja. More West African riders joined the friends during their visit to Nigeria. They continued together, following the Niger River. A sandstorm in Mali made it difficult to run."
"We also invite children who struggle with the treatment and regulation of emotions to see if their brain structure and function are different from children who have no problems with the treatment of emotions. So far, there have been several small studies, suggesting that there are differences in brain function and structure in children who have aggressive behaviour. But, as described in our MRI section, there are challenges when researching with younger participants. For example, it is very difficult for children to stay very motionless while MRI takes pictures. Most studies have very few participants, and the results are not as clear. A method called ""meta-analysis"" helps to summarize the information of all these very important small studies. Meta-analysis takes the results of many studies and combines them into a single great discovery."
"It's a hot Saturday on the farm. Maya, Duksie and Doobie help Mama K in her vegetable garden. The children work all morning. They dig compost in the ground. They weed and water the vegetable garden. Then they harvest what is ripe. Today, each of the children will bring home freshly picked strawberries, spinach and carrots. Mama K always gives the children a treat to help her. Sometimes, the treat is a cake, chocolate or long candies that look like snakes. Sometimes it's apples, pears or oranges. Mama K has only one rule. ""Just share!"" Children know that they have to share the treats equally, so they all get the same amount. Today, Mama K cooked a round strawberry cake with pink icing and berries from her garden."
"When we arrived at the dive site, we carefully checked all our equipment and put on our fins and masks. As soon as we were underwater, we were greeted by a school of yellow-backed riflemen. There were so many different creatures to see around this big table coral: Oriental sweetlips, parrots, batfish, and even a beautifully patterned nudibranche. This trumpet fish changed color to try to melt in a yellow tang school, but you can choose it quite easily, right? It's a good thing that we kept a safe distance from this lion fish. The thorns on his back can be very poisonous! These clown fish carefully kept their homemade sea anemone, but finally agreed to let me take some pictures."
"The corals are both plants and animals. Thousands of small algae live inside the corals, and give them energy to develop. They have hard outer skeletons and develop in many different forms. Plankton is the main source of food for many marine creatures. It is a mixture of algae, bacteria, small animals and eggs and larvae of larger animals that float with ocean currents. Feather stars can look like plants, but they are really animals. They use their ""arms"" as feathers to catch and eat pieces of floating plankton. Parrots have strong teeth that form a beak similar to a parrot, which they use to scrape the algae of hard coral."
"A regnal year is a year of the reign of a monarch. It is a Latin regnum which means kingdom or reign. Some of the oldest dating systems were in regnal years. A regnal year usually begins on the date of the accession of a monarch to the throne. The first year is counted from day one to the end of the first year of the reign of a monarch. Then a second year of reign, a third year, and so on. They would not have a zero year reign. It is displayed as an ordinal number, not cardinal. Each year of the reign of a monarch falls into two calendar years, unless the reign begins on the first day of the calendar year."
"The parents gave a little pot as a gift to their daughter. Natabo loved this little pot. She liked to play with it. One day, by chance, the boys broke Natabo's pot. He broke into small pieces. The brothers didn't know what to do. They threw the pieces in the bush. Natabo looked for her pot but didn't find it. She got upset and cried. She refused to eat anything. She begged her parents and brothers to find the pot, but they couldn't. Natabo became even more upset. She fled and went into the forest. She climbed the tallest tree in the forest. Natabo's parents looked for her daughter. They found her, and asked her to come down. But she refused. They told her to go down, but she always refused. Natabo's brothers gathered and sang a song to ask her to come down."
"Even the clothes we wear every day are scrupulously designed after Victorian antiquities and 19th-century fashion plates. The clothes are incredibly intimate. They influence our way of moving, and at the same time record tiny details about us that seem too common to write — things as if the objects in our pockets are light or heavy, or what we do with our hands when we do not have pockets at all. I have sewn all my own clothes by hand, and Gabriel's are made for him by a seamstress in Seattle. I am an author; as with any real writer, it is not only my profession but how I feel about the world."
"In initial cases such as Panama Refning Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935) and A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935) demanded from Congress clear limits on presidential discretion for a valid delegation. The modern approach required that Congress set out a ""smart principle"" to guide administrative and judicial bodies. According to the three-party test established by Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373 (1989), Congress must define the ""general policy"" to be carried out, designate the body that is supposed to carry out the policy, and specify the limits of delegated authority."
"In its Greek origin, the word has no negative meaning: we translate Oedipus Tyranos as 'Oedipus the King'. A tyrant usually directs a country, and he often has his position as a powerful ruler by force, although some of them inherited their power. Later, the word came to mean someone who ruled with cruelty and injustice. The rule of a tyrant is called tyranny. The adjective is tyrannical. A dictator or despot is someone who rules with absolute authority, usually cruelly. It now has the same meaning as 'tyrant', whereas before, 'tyrant' meant something like 'governing' or 'king'. In the 10th and 9th centuries BC, ancient Greece was ruled by monarchs. In the 7th century BC, they were governed by groups of aristocrats. These aristocrats began to become unpopular."
"The Puritans believed that in order to become bewitched a witch had to draw an individual under a spell. The girls could not have brought this condition on themselves. Soon they were questioned and forced to name their executioners. Three inhabitants, including Tituba, were named witches. The famous Salem witchcraft trials began as the girls began to appoint more and more members of the community. The evidence admitted in such trials were of five types. First, the accused could be asked to take a test, like recite the Lord's prayer. This seems quite simple. But the young girls who attended the trial were known to shout and write on the ground in the middle of the test. It is easy to understand why some could not pass."
The first phase of this war was a disaster for Britain. The assaults on French territory ended with bitter defeat. The French and their Indian allies inspired fear on the British border by burning and looting colonies. The French even struck less than sixty miles from Philadelphia. The Americans were dismayed. They believed that Britain was not properly engaged in North America. The turn of the war came when British statesman William Pitt took over the war operations. He believed that North America was critical of England's domination. Pitt turned the command of recruitment and supply to the local authorities in America and promised to repay them for their efforts.
"Most of the immigrant groups that had previously come to America by choice seemed to be distinct, but had many similarities. Most came from North and West Europe. Most had some experience of representative democracy. With the exception of the Irish, most were Protestants. Many were literate, and some had a fairly high degree of wealth. The groups that subsequently arrived by boatloads at Gilded's age were characterized by few of these characteristics. Their nationalities included Greek, Italian, Polish, Slovak, Serbian, Russian, Croatian, and others. Until the federal decree cut off Japanese and Chinese settlers settled on the American west coast. None of these groups were primarily Protestant. The vast majority were Roman or Eastern Orthodox Catholics. However, due to the increased persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe, many Jewish immigrants sought freedom to torment."
"When Jefferson Davis sent a group to Washington to negotiate the transfer from Fort Sumter to South Carolina, they were quickly refused. Lincoln had a dilemma. Fort Sumter was short of supplies, but any attack on the militias of South Carolina cutting off the fort of resupplication appeared to be a North aggression. States that remained in the Union (such as Virginia and North Carolina) could be led into the secessionist camp if they thought that the Union soldiers were the aggressors. People at home and abroad could become friendly to the South. But Lincoln could not let his troops starve, nor surrender and risk showing considerable weakness. Finally, he developed a plan. On April 6, Lincoln told the governor of South Carolina that he was going to send supplies to Fort Sumter."
"Long before Cortés landed in Vera Cruz on Good Friday, 1519, doom omens appeared. A comet ""beautiful as if to turn the night in the day"" lit up the sky. Astronauts and disconcerted astrologers maintained that they did not see him, and Montezuma threw them into cages where they died of hunger. Then, an important temple burned. Finally, hunters brought to Montezuma a bird with a mirror attached to his head. He saw a large number of people there ""advanced as for the war; they seemed to be half of the deer."" How many things did it do? How many myths? Since most of the story is told from the point of view of the Spaniards, it is difficult to say."
"On 7 May 1915, a German U-boat torpedoed the ship without warning, sending 1198 passengers, including 128 Americans, to an icy grave. Lusitania, as it turned out, was carrying more than 4 million ammunition. President Wilson was rabid. Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, recommended a ban on travel to the United States on all ships of nations at war. Wilson preferred a harder line against the German Kaiser. He demanded the immediate end of the underwater war, inciting Bryan to resign in protest. The Germans began a two-year advocacy practice to end the underwater attacks, reneging on this promise, and the release of again under the United States."
"On 1 February 1960, the peaceful activists introduced a new tactic into their set of strategies. Four African-American students went to a lunch counter reserved for whites at the local Woolworth store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked for coffee. When they were refused service, the students sat patiently. Despite the threats and intimidations, the students sat quietly and waited for service. The civil rights sit-in was not born. No one participated in a sit-in of this kind without serious purpose. The instructions were simple: sit quietly and wait for service. Often the participants were harassed and threatened by local customers. Sometimes they were plagued with food or ketchup. The Protesters did not respond when they were provoked by angry spectators."
"In the days following the fall of Fort Sumter, four other states joined the Confederation: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas. The lines of battle were now drawn. On paper, the Union prevailed over almost all aspects of the Confederation. Nearly 21 million people lived in 23 states of the North. The South claimed only 9 million people — including 3.5 million slaves — in the states of Confederation. Despite the increase in the population of the North, however, the South had an almost equal size army in the first year of the war. The North also had a huge industrial advantage. At the beginning of the war, the Confederation had only one ninth of the Union's industrial capacity. But this statistic was misleading. In 1860, the North produced 97 percent of the country's firearms, 96 percent of its railway locomotives, 94 percent of its fabric, 93 percent of its pig iron, and over 90 percent of its boots and shoes."
"A noble death trembles in the Hall of Truth. Behind the noble Horus, the half-falcon, the half-head of the Earth, unleashes a piercing look at the trembling man. Thoth, the divinity of the scribes with sharp beaks and heads ibis, sharpens his pen, ready to record a verdict of divine judgment. Sitting before the nobleman on a throne of gold is Osiris, the king of the dead. On his head rests a glittering crown with a magnificent white plume of feathers on each side. Behind Osiris stands Isis, the venerated goddess of nature, who is responsible for bringing the dead earth back to life every year. She holds an an ankh, a cross with a loop over the bar. An ankh guarantees that a death will live forever. The noble wonders if he will live forever. Or will be fed to the horrible god of the crocodiles called the State of the Dead and will cease to exist."
"It was time for the children to say goodbye to their friends. The sun did not move. It remained stubbornly rooted in the same place. Normally, the shadows grew longer, and later the shadows grew. But on that day, the shadows did not grow. The sun refused to go to bed. Below, the children always played, laughed, jumped and jumped, although it was long after their playing time. Parents, being parents, looked with concern at their watches. They were perplexed. What were they to do? Clocks showed that it was past the playing time, but the sun was still standing at the time of the game! In the distant villages, the parents said, ""Children, it is the time of the bed."" And the children, being children, replied, ""But the sun still shines."" Mothers and dads looked at each other."
"This evening, I want to present you with an economic argument for genuine democracy. I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and the Eurogroup are wrong to believe that we can do without democracy — that we need an authentic and hard-working democracy. And without democracy, our societies will be more tedious, our dark future and our great new technologies wasted. Speaking of waste, let me stress an interesting paradox that threatens our economies at this time. I call it the paradox of both summits. A summit that you understand - you know, you recognize - is the mountain of debts that has cast a long shadow on the United States, Europe, the whole world. We all recognize the mountain of debts. But few people discern its twin. An inactive mountain of money belonging to the rich savers and businesses, too terrified to invest it in productive activities that can generate the incomes that you can quench the mountain of debts and that can produce all these things that humanity desperately needs."
"For many months, the heavens were dry. Lomongin, the famous rain showerer, spoke to his gods. People gathered in front of his house, waiting impatiently for a message of hope. When he went out, he told the people that the creator was going to give them the rain soon. They could plant their crops. The children were playing outside as we expected the rains. Later that day, we saw large white clouds in the Far East. I knew that there were clouds of rain. People were still thinking of what the rain shower was saying. Mother shouted aloud: ""There! the clouds are now dark. Come in."" The rain was poured. We had waited for the rains! At first we were happy. But the rains did not stop. There was water everywhere. The bridge connecting our village to the continent was washed. The houses were washed by the floods."
"One morning, Ekai was awakened by his mother. He was in deep sleep and he could not wake up immediately. His mother called him ""Ekai! Ekai-i-i."" Ekai was very bored because it was something unusual for him. His mother had prepared breakfast for him and hot water to bathe. Ekai woke up, took a bath and breakfast. Ekai's mother brought him a new school uniform and a pair of black shoes with grey socks. He was surprised to see his father holding a blue bag filled with books. He knew that his time to start school had arrived. Ekai and his father left the house. He waved to his mother and held his father's hand. They walked to the bus stop. They found a bus ready to leave. They boarded the bus. After a few minutes, they reached a place where there were many buildings and children."
"Once upon a time, there was a goat called Igodhobe. Igodhobe the goat was king of farm animals and birds. He lived a good life. One day, Igodhobe the goat called all the animals and birds to a meeting. ""My friends, I called you because I had a dream,"" said the goat. ""All the animals and birds kept silent. They listened carefully to their king. I dreamed that there was no food or water in the land. Many of our parents died!"" said the king. ""When the animals and birds heard the dream, they were worried. What will we do?"" asked the cat. The chicken and duck had an idea. They said, ""Let each of us bring food and put it in the king's store. All the animals accepted this idea. The king made a rule."
"Electronic amplifiers make a signal of the radio or electrical instrument stronger and stronger by using transistors or vacuum tubes. Electronic amplifiers must be connected to the electric current or battery to function. Once the signal of the radio or electrical instrument has been made stronger and stronger, the signal must be connected to a speaker so that people can hear it. When an amplifier tries to make the sound stronger than it can, it adds a distortion to the sound. Some amplifiers are made to add a controlled distortion. The distortion of the transistors is different from the distortion of the tubes. The distortion of the tubes is often referred to as more musical."
"Our results support our prediction that people with LTP damage would be able to recognize famous songs, but not name them. These results help to show that LTP is a critical region to name appropriate names of different types, including famous faces, landmarks, and now songs. Without this brain region, people are altered to name unique elements. This shows us that LTP is an important brain region to name appropriate elements. LTP is called a ""convergence zone"" to name elements. This means that LTP does not store the names of the elements, but it is an area where the names of the elements are linked to the information about the elements. This explains why people with LTP damage can say information about the element but not the name. So, the next time you hear a song on the radio and think about its name, remember that you use your LTP!"
"DNA is the molecule that contains the genetic code of the organisms and, therefore, can be described as the ""blue print"" of the cell, since it tells the cell what to do and when to do it. It can be divided into small subsections called genes. There are thousands of genes in the DNA of an organism and each gene has a specific function. For example, human DNA contains about 25,000-35,000 genes, but only a few genes are responsible for the color of your eyes. NGS technology allows scientists to ""read"" the DNA of an entire microbial community without the need for pure cultures of the microbes. This approach is called ""Metagenome sequencing"" and provides the scientist with a list of genes of all the microbes living in a particular region."
"In January and February, the sun woke up early every day and shone heavily. All crops and grass dried up. People were thirsty. Animals had no water. Every place was very hot. People were looking for small rivers to swim. In March, the rain suddenly started pouring. It was raining in the morning. It was raining in the afternoon. It was raining in the evening and at night. Everything was wet. Then the weather became cold. People had to cover themselves with long jackets and big hats. Everything was muddy. Farmers were excited. They planted a lot of crops for food. They hoped that crops would grow quickly once the rain stopped."
"In a village, there was a disagreement between people from different occupations. Everyone thought their work was the most important! The teacher said he had the most important occupation. ""Without teachers, you couldn't go to school and learn."" The builder said he had the most important occupation. ""Without builders, you wouldn't have schools to learn or to sleep in the houses."" The carpenter said he had the most important occupation. ""Without carpenters, you wouldn't have furniture for your homes and schools."" The doctor said he had the most important occupation. ""Without doctors and nurses, you could get sick and die. The farmer said she had the most important occupation. ""Without farmers, you wouldn't have food to eat."" The student argued that the students had the most important work. ""Without students, there would be no teachers, builders, doctors, farmers or carpenters."""
"According to Maslow, our most basic needs, such as the need for food, air and water, are innate. These needs are required for the survival of our species. According to Maslow, humans are motivated to satisfy the obvious needs of survival first. Only once these needs are met, we begin to grow and focus on our needs ""of a higher order."" This hierarchy is most often presented as a pyramid. The lowest levels of the pyramid are made up of the most basic needs, while the most complex needs are located at the top of the pyramid. The first level of the hierarchy of needs of Maslow: I. PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS Physiological needs are the physical needs for the survival of man. If these needs are not met, the human body cannot function properly and will ultimately fail. Physiological needs are considered the most important; they should be met first. Air, water and food are metabolic needs for the survival of all animals, including humans."
"Frank Abagnale was born in Bronxville, New York, and lived there until the age of sixteen. His first victim of abuse was his father, who gave him a gas credit card and a truck at the age of fifteen, so that he could go and come from his part-time work. Instead of using the card to buy gas as planned, Abagnale used it to buy tires, batteries and other products at the gas stations, then he sold the products to people for money. His father was responsible for a $3,400 bill for all the products Abagnale loaded on the card."
"The survivors of the accident had found a small transistor radio on the plane and Roy Harley, one of the survivors, first heard the news that the search had been cancelled on the 11th day on the mountain. Upon hearing the news, the survivors began to cry and pray — all except Gustavo Nicolich, who was calmly looking at the mountains that rose west. ""Hey boys,"" he cried, ""there is good news! We just heard on the radio. ""They called for research."" In the crowded plane, there was silence. As the despair of their situation engulfed them, they were crying. ""Why is hell this good news?"" another loudly shouted at Nicolich. ""Because it means,"" Nicolich said, ""that we are going out of here by ourselves."""
"Freud believed that the id acts according to the ""principle of pleasure"" – the psychic force that motivates the tendency to seek immediate satisfaction of any impulse. The id is the only component of the personality that is present from birth, and for good reasons. Infants depend on others to provide them with food, to change their diaper, and to avoid pain or discomfort. The id is the part of the mind that forces a baby to cry when he needs something, ensuring a healthy and happy education. The id, according to Freud, is the most selfish part of our mind. It is only the immediate satisfaction of all that the need or need of the body is experiencing at this moment. Freud stated that the id ""knows no judgment of value: no good and evil, no moral"" – only the fulfilment of immediate desires. Infants, for example, do not take into account the needs of their parents when they cry."
"The king's bull got stuck in the mud!"" All the villagers came to run. What about the king, concerns everyone. A crowd quickly gathered around the head and tail. They began to ask, ""Now what do we do?"" Magezi Mataala Manene advised, ""Some of you pull the tail, and some of you pull the head. We are pulling the bull out of the mud."" The people took his advice. ""Ready! One, two, three, shoot! Get out now wwww!"" they shouted. The villagers fell on each other from the effort to shoot. Two were still holding their heads. One was holding their tail. Magezi Mataala Manene shouted, ""Wo we! You took out the king's bull. Each of you must give a bull to the king."" Quickly, the people returned to their houses."
"Once upon a time, there was a man called Byantaka who had a cow. Every day, Byantaka kissed his cow. He also gave water to the cow, but Byantaka had only a very small pot for the water. Thus, he went to his neighbor to borrow a pot for the water. His neighbor agreed to lend Byantaka his biggest pot of clay saying, ""My neighbor's problem is my problem."" After a few days, Byantaka went to a potter and bought him a small pot. He took it home. He put the pot inside the large pot he had borrowed from his neighbor. Then, he put the big pot, with the pot inside, on his head. He carried the great pot to the neighbor who lent it to him. Byantaka said to him, ""I return your pot, he reproduced it."" The neighbor was surprised that his pot had produced another pot. He rented Byantaka saying, ""Your house is blessed."""
"Humans are responsible for the production of large amounts of CO2. Every day we use fossil fuels (such as coal, oil or natural gas, which we find underground in solid, liquid or gaseous forms) in our cars or power plants, or we reduce forests. All of these combined activities have increased the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere to levels that have not been seen on earth in 55 million years. This increase in greenhouse gases warms the earth. The rise in temperature causes climate change, which is a change in the global or regional average. Scientists plan that climate change will lead to higher sea levels, more intense heat waves, extreme weather conditions, extinction of species and other negative impacts on our world. Fortunately, there are several steps we can take to reduce the impacts of future climate change."
"The intelligent Rabbit woke up inside his hut. He thought, ""I want to explore the outside world."" The other rabbits were falling asleep. The door of their hut opened. The farmer came in. It was meal time for the rabbits. The food smelled good. All the other rabbits were now awake. They were getting close to the farmer. The intelligent Rabbit was watching the farmer come out of the hut. ""Ah! Now I know how I can sneak out. Tomorrow I have to get out of here."" ""I'm going to jump into the basket when the farmer brings food,"" thought the intelligent Rabbit. The other rabbits quickly finished their meal and fell asleep. In the morning, the farmer brought food for the rabbits. ""Today is the day, thought the intelligent Rabbit."" As soon as the farmer dropped the basket, the intelligent Rabbit quickly jumped. No one saw him. After the rabbit had fed the others to the basket."
"Neuroethics is a field of study dedicated to understanding the ethical, legal and social impact of research on and on the brain (i.e. neuro). Neuroethics also aims to better understand the processes of the brain that are involved in making decisions about what is right or wrong. Ultimately, neuroethics research seeks to identify solutions to help neurosciences and society come together safely and with the best results. Neuroethics research is divided into four broad areas of study. To better understand each of these areas, we highlight four examples of neuroethics research in each of the four categories. Cognitive improvement refers to improving the skills of thought when there is no problem inherent in thought."
"She sat down and thought about what had to be done. After a long time she decided to go looking for a house that was already built. One day she saw a cave. She looked inside. She looked warm and dry! But the cave belonged to a rabbit and her children. She climbed a tree. But she was chased by birds singing and hugging loudly in their nests. The turtle went sadly, sweating in the heat of the sun. One day, as the turtle wandered, she found a cow in her enclosure. She was with her calves. ""Can I join you, please?"" asked Tortoise."
"It's Billy. He's the goat Jan was given by his father as a gift. Even though Billy is stubborn, Jan loves him very much. He always gives birth to healthy children that Jan and his father sell. Yesterday Billy came out of their pregnancy with his two children. Jan doesn't like it because the children are easily stolen or being eaten by dogs. Billy chews the books containing all the homework that Ann had done. Ann was angry that she was going to be punished by her teacher. She hit Billy very had. This made Jan angry. He locked himself in his room to play with his toys. Jan is afraid that his father will sell Billy for what he did. However, Mr. Tom, his father doesn't want to bother his son by selling Billy. He promised to wait for the children to be old enough to give Jan one."
"For her last birthday, Sisanda had a special pleasure – her parents allowed her to have a party at the reserve. The giraffes of the reserve were curious of this group of people. They stretched their long necks for the best view of the party and they even seemed to want a part of the birthday cake! Sisanda liked giraffes. All the animals were special for her, but it was the quiet and sweet giraffes who stole her heart. She could spend the whole day watching them. On a Friday, Sisanda's father returned to the work house early. He looked very upset. ""What's wrong with her, Baba?"" Sisanda asked. ""Today, a swarm of bees stole a giraffe mother,"" explained Sisanda's father. ""Her head was so swollen with all the bites that her beautiful eyes were closed. We tried everything to help her, but it was not useful - she died. And the sad part of everything was that she still needed a young calf."""
"A woman with her baby entered the forest and went to pick fruit. In the forest, she found a tree with ripe fruit. She dropped her sleeping baby and climbed the tree. A snot from another community came. He saw the baby. He was surprised. He wondered, ""Where is the mother?"" He bent. The noise of the chains on her neck woke the baby. He let the baby play with his chains. The baby laughed as he played. The woman looked down to see why the baby was laughing. She saw the stranger. She was so afraid that she dropped her bag of fruit. The erotic looked up. He said, ""Don't be afraid. I only play with your beautiful baby."" So, the woman came down from the tree. The erotic took off one of her chains. He gave it to the baby."
"The village of Sinyaire was surrounded by hills. Many snakes lived in the forest on these hills. The largest snake was called Unyalego by the villagers. Uniyalego scared many people. He swallowed whole goats and sheep. One day, three sisters, Apiyo, Ajoh and Atieno went to the forest to get firewood. The grandmother of the girls warned, ""Beware of Unyalego the great snake. Do not take anything from the forest except the wood."" Only Ajoh did not pay attention to her grandmother. The girls packed the milk, bananas, sweet potatoes and water. They took ropes to tie the firewood and a sharp machete to cut the wood."
"Amara loved animals very much. Amara lived with her mother, Margy. She was a very hardworking farmer. Amara's father died when she was five years old. When Amara was not in school, she spent her time with Mbisa, the goat. She had cleaned her and fed her. Amara also had her pet, Simba. Her mother did not like dogs much, but she let Amara keep Simba. Every time Simba had disturbed her, she shouted, ""Go before I saw you."" Amara felt sad. One Saturday, they had visitors from the women's group. Amara was happy that her mother's friends had come with their children. They could play football. Her mother had prepared the food that the group loved. Amara was called back by her mother to keep Simba locked up."
"The moon asked the rain, ""What are you doing to help the earth?"" The rain replied, ""I give water to the earth so that the trees and plants can grow well. I gave water to the animals to drink."" The rain asked, ""What are you doing to help the earth?"" The wind answered, ""I sweep the earth clean. I scatter the rain all over the earth."" The wind asked the sun, ""What are you doing to help the earth?"" The sun replied, ""I give light and heat to the earth, so that the animals and plants can live."" The sun, the moon, the rain and the wind listened carefully."
"Thoko was sitting on his father's cart. He was stacked high with honeycombs. There were many children on the cart. They were coming home after spending all day in the fields. They had all worked hard that day. Thoko was very lucky. He worked the hardest of all the children. So his father had bought him a FantaPine drink from M'e Pontso's shop. ""Mmmmm, mmmm is delicious,"" said Thoko. It was Thoko's favorite drink. He sipped it slowly. He wanted him to last until they reached the top of the hill. At the top of the hill, his father stopped to give a rest to the ox. ""What a beautiful valley we live in the children,"" he said. ""We were lucky to live in such a clean and fresh place."" He smiled."
"The most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of the larval stages is probably the need for dispersal. Sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates, and marine bottom groups such as mussels and crabs, need in a certain way to move their young into a new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have relatively long pelagic stages (the length of a larva is in the water column). Meanwhile, larvae feed and grow, and many species pass through several stages of development. For example, most of the barnacles molt through six nauplius larva stages before molting towards a cipris, when they seek to settle."
"One day, as Magozwe looked through the trash, he found an old storybook tattered. He cleaned the dirt and put it in his bag. Every day after, he took out the book and looked at the pictures. He couldn't read the words. The pictures told the story of a boy who grew up to be a pilot. Magozwe dreamed of being a pilot. Sometimes he imagined that he was the boy in history. It was cold and Magozwe stood on the road begging. A man was walking towards him. ""Hello, I am Thomas. I work in a place where you can eat something,"" he said. Thomas pointed to a nearby house. ""I hope you will go there and get food?"" he asked. Magozwe looked at the man, and then at home. ""Maybe,"" he said, and went away."
"The city bus was almost full, but more people were still pushing up. Some packed their luggage under the bus. Others put their stuff on the racks inside. New passengers were clutching their tickets as they were looking for somewhere to sit on the crowded bus. Women with young children made them comfortable for the long trip. I tightened them next to a window. The person sitting next to me was firmly holding a green plastic bag. He was wearing old sandals, a worn coat, and he looked nervous. I looked outside the bus and realized that I was leaving my village, where I had grown up. I was going to the big city. The load was finished and all the passengers were sitting. Hawkers were still pushed on the bus to sell their goods to the passengers. Everyone shouted the names of what was available for sale."

"When Dad came home, Sima was breastfeeding Siza. ""What are you doing?"" asked Papa. ""I'm a nurse,"" said Sima. ""Do you want to play with me?"" ""Yes. But we're going to go to the park and play soccer,"" said Papa. ""His friends saw Sima and Dad playing soccer. They joined together. Sima and Dad often play soccer now. But they still haven't played with dolls. One day, Sima was playing hospital-hospital with her dolls. He heard Mom screaming. ""Sima! Run! Dad is waiting to play with you at the park."" ""Why are you dressed in a dress?"" said Papa in an angry voice."
"The human brain is probably the most complex structure known of science. A century ago, the German Korbinian Brodmann made the first serious attempt to catalogue this complexity. He divided the cerebral cortex, the largest and only mammalian part of the brain, into about fifty regions based on their anatomical appearance. These regions are now known as ""Brodmann zones."" In modern neurosciences, we understand that some of these anatomical regions have similar functions, while others play multiple roles. For example, the regions of Brodmann 39, 40 and part of 22 form together ""Wernicke area"", named after Carl Wernicke, another German."
"One day, we saw a strange black cloud moving from a distance. It was a cloud of locusts, heading towards our village. The locusts attacked the farms and ate the crops. We tried to hunt the locusts. But they were not going. We were making noises and shouting: ""Wuwi, wuwi!"" But the locusts were not going. We hit boxes and pots of metal. But the locusts were not going. We were not going to light fires to chase the locusts. But they were not going. They were not going. They were settling on trees. The branches were broken because of the weight of all the locusts. Then we remembered that the roasted locusts were good to eat! Everyone started picking up the locusts in bags and nets."
"Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. ""Where is the bus?"" they asked. Ebei was worried. ""We won't be able to go to the city,"" he thought. ""I won't be able to get my uniform."" Some abandoned and went home. Ebei cried. He didn't want to go. ""We're going to wait a little more,"" his mother said. Suddenly, they heard a noise. They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming! But this bus wasn't blue. It wasn't big. It was red and small. People didn't want to get on that bus."
"Her mother Mrs. Anok has always supported Ekai in the purchase of the animals. Goats, chickens, chicks, cattle, rabbits and a dog are Ekai's favorite animals. During the holidays Ekai with the help of his sister will take the goats out to feed in the banks of the nearby river, have fun and make sure that all their animals are satisfied. In the pasture banks Ekai would hold one of the goats after he took water confirming how the goats grow fat every day. Ekai has a dog animal called Bony. Every time Ekai is around, he would give Bony food and a hot shower with a shampoo, which makes Bony a happy and healthy dog. In the morning Ekai and his sister will give the birds food and water before eating breakfast."
"Nkanyezi walked all day. She climbed up a hill and went down into a valley. She crossed the great river and climbed between sharp rocks. She walked through the plains until she reached the shade of the red mountains. At night Nkanyezi arrived in a village of motifs and colors as she had never seen before. She told the elders of the village about her journey to bring the spirit of the feast to her people. The mother of this tribe gave a gift to Nkanyezi. She said to the girl: ""With love we give you this painting to restore the color of your village."" Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the painting in her bag."
"One day, Kindru-Lalim pointed out: ""O Lali, I am so tired of living in a dark cave. Why don't we build a house in the forest?"" ""It's a fantastic idea, Kindru!"" cried Kincha Lali-Dam. ""Let's go ask our friends - birds, beasts and reptiles - how to build a house!"" So Kincha Lali-Dam and Kindru-Lalim came out of their caves and entered a dense forest. The first animal they saw was an elephant standing under a tree, beating his big ears. ""Can you tell us how to build a house, oh powerful?"" they asked. The elephant sounded loud and said, ""Graws to make pillars as strong and thick as my legs!"" The two friends cut a tree and made large pillars of it."
"Imagine a dark and moonless night when you went camping with your classmates and you lost your way. What would you do? Do you not try to contact your friends by flashing your torch? Well, fireflies or ""light bugs"" as they are sometimes called doing the same thing, except that they have an unlimited supply of light in themselves! That's why fireflies never worry about melted bulbs or electricity prices. They seem extremely happy to fly around and shine - that's their signal to say, ""Hey, look! I am here!"" The luciole is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferine. Proteins are special foods used by our bodies to create muscles, bones and skin, while pigments are natural colouring substances present in plants and animals."
"The fog is formed when the humid air is cooled under a specific temperature and some of the water vapours condensate (turns into tiny liquid droplets). By definition, time is considered foggy when one cannot see more than 1000 m in advance. In his book, Robert L. May describes the fog ""as thick as the white fizz"" and almost zero visibility (it was ""black and dredge""), suggesting that fog could have been one of two possible types: radiation fog or ice fog. The radiation fog occurs when the ground cools the air above by contact. Ice fog occurs when the hot air interacts with the extremely cold air and the water vapour changes directly into a solid, forming small ice crystals suspended in the air. The ability of light to shine through the fog varies according to the colour of the light."
"Most of the time, Hare took seeds from the attic of Hyena. He went to his field and pretended to work. He would light a fire and roast the seeds. He did nothing except eat roasted seeds. At the time of harvest, Hare went to steal his friend's ripe corn. He carried it to his own attic. Hyena complained about the stolen crops. Hare replied, ""Maybe the neighbors stole your corn. They suffer from famine because they are lazy."" Hyena thought of this problem for a long time. He came with an idea. He collected gum from the trees. He put this sticky gum around the field. The thief was stuck in the gum. During the night Hare went to the field of Hyena to steal more corn. Before entering the field, he looked around him to see if she was sure. Hare did not see the gum that Hyena had put around the field. Hare stood in the gum and was stuck."
"Then he said to the following child: ""I am old enough for meat. Here's yours. Wait until you are older."" Each small portion became even smaller. This happened for all children. The youngest child had a small piece of meat. The father kept the large pieces of meat for him and his wife. The children were calm and ate their food. Years passed and the children grew up. The parents grew up. They became weak. The children took care of their old mother and father. One day at the time of the meal, the eldest child served the meat, as usual. But this time, she gave only a small piece to her father and a small piece to her mother. She told her parents: ""You ate, now is our time. We are old enough."" She served most of the meat to her brothers and sisters. The father remembered what he had done while his children were young."

Good invites his family to a party. They are surprised. It's not Bon's birthday."
"Hare used to sit down all day doing nothing and when Hyena came home after work, Hare always asked him for nuts from his farm. But Hyena didn't like it much. Hyena believes in working hard and not getting things for free. So, one day Hyena thought of himself, ""It's so hard to work all day by myself. Maybe Hare could help me and in return he can get some nuts for which he actually worked."" Hare accepted his terms and they shake hands on her because he thought it was a good deal. They also agreed that more work could be done and they would also get enough food for their families."

"Elephant lived in a house on one side of the palace. Chameleon lived on the other side. At that time, there was a terrible drought throughout the country. The king had an idea and called his two neighbors to the palace. The king said to Elephant and Chameleon: ""I want you to trample the ground with your feet until the water comes out."" The king promised a great reward to the one who succeeded. Chameleon had no hope since he was very small. Elephant was extremely happy since he was so big and powerful. Elephant went on the field and began to stow down on the ground. A lot of dust came, but no water. Elephant hit the ground until the water was almost out, but he was too tired. He gave Chameleon a chance to try. Chameleon started to stow himself on the ground."
"On the way, we saw our friends playing football. ""Ah! Football!"" I said. I wanted to play too. I said to Chuma, ""Let's ask if we can play with them. I like playing football very much."" Chuma replied, ""Let's go first to the store, then we can play."" But I answered, ""Let's play first! Grandma won't let us come back."" We joined our friends to play. I was the goalkeeper. The poles were made of two big stones. I worked hard to catch the ball. My friends couldn't score goals. We played until the field was full of sand. Then we went to the store. Grandma's money was gone! I started crying. Chuma cried, ""Stop crying. You wanted to play first."" We came home without salt or cooking oil. We were very dirty and worried."
"There is no specific scientific calculator prescribed for this subject. Any non-programmable scientific calculator is suitable for your studies. Different scientific calculators have different functions and it is up to you to know your calculator. Most scientific calculators have algebraic logic; the operation in an expression can be entered into the calculator in the order in which the expression is read (from left to right). The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. You can configure your calculator to function either in a natural or linear display. The natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions and certain functions to display as you see them on paper. The linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. When we encounter an expression like 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference in the way we choose the operations to perform first. Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow predefined mathematical rules."
"The candle clock was used years ago to indicate the passage of time. Special candles were marked with lines spaced so that, like the burnt candle, a line would disappear every hour. The line marking process is called calibration. In this activity, you will calibrate a candle to make a candle clock. A. Plan the activity a few days before it can take the most part of the day to finish. AND plan a strategy to convince the director to use your candle to run the school for a day. B. Decide which marks you will make on the candle. You can choose, for example, to make marks for 15 minutes of time. Thin candles burn faster than thick candles. C. Place candles firmly in the supports. D. Place candles together and check that the candles are of the same height. E. Light a candle. After the chosen period mark the second candle in front of the top of the burned candle."
"Sakima replied: ""I know them, Mom. I hear them in my mind and then sing."" Sakima liked to sing for her little sister, especially if she was hungry. Her sister listened to her favorite song. She was heading towards the soothing melody. ""Can we sing again and again, Sakima,"" asked Sakima, her sister begged him. Sakima accepted and sang again and again.

They decided to elect Rooster as their king. The animals hoped that the fire of Rooster would help them in cold weather. Then came a day when it was raining. And raining. It was cold. It was all wet and cold. ""Where can we fire to warm our bodies? Rabbit asked the other animals. ""We can pull a comb on Rooster's head,"" replied Monkey. ""Rooster is our king because he has fire on his head,"" said Monkey. The animals agreed with Monkey."

"Now, with the sun gone, there was darkness everywhere. The deer could not see the tigers. The elephants hit each other in the trees. The rabbits walked on the lions and there was confusion all around. To find a solution, the animals decided to have a meeting. A rabbit told them one of the seven suns that were still alive and that were hiding behind a hill. But who would be the best to remember the sun? ""I will call to the sun, says the lion, for he was the king of the forest. Sun, sun, please don't run away. Return and shine upon us, roared the lion. But the sun didn't listen to him. The elephant then called. He raised his trunk and cried, ""Sun, sun, please come back."" But the sun didn't listen to him."
"Once upon a time, he lived a woman. She always wanted a child. The woman took the best clay ground she could find. She started to make a girl. The girl who was made of mud became a real human girl. The woman called the girl Akatope. The woman was very happy. She loved Akatope very much. Akatope was warned by her mother not to leave the hut. She did not listen.

"When they reached the first piece of fat meat, Hyena felt a jerk. One of Raven's tail feathers came out in his hand! Then there was another dick, and another one. Raven felt much lighter, and the pain in his tail went. He sang: Raven's feathers, unplug you. Raven's feathers, unplug you. In answer, Hyena sang the opposite: Raven's feathers stand, do not unplug you. Raven's feathers stand, do not unplug you. Finally, the feathers could not hold Hyena any longer. He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky. He jumped on the fat meat thinking that, as he ate, the fat meat would hold him. But as he tried to hold and eat the 'live', all that he felt was cloudy! Now he fell fast."
"Gary Dahl was the inventor of the rock; he was sitting in a bar in California in 1975, listening to his friends discuss the needs and troubles of their animals. In response, he designed the idea of a rock, which the owner would not have to bathe, marry, walk or eat; the rock could never become sick or disobedient. Dahl joked that it would make them perfect pets. Although he was content to make a joke at first, Dahl ended up taking the idea of rock seriously. He actually packed stones and sold them for almost $17 according to today's standards. He even wrote a 32-page instruction manual on the care of them, which spoke of rock as if it were a real animal."
"The behaviour of the herd in humans is frequently observed in times of danger and panic; for example, a fire in a building often causes behavior of the herd, people often suspend their individual reasoning and flee together in a package. People in a crisis that requires escape will try to move faster than normal, copy the actions of others, interact physically with each other, and ignore other strategies in favour of following the tendency to mass escape. Another commonly cited example of human herd behavior is the phenomenon of stock market bubbles."
"The psychologist Herbert Kelman identified and labelled three main types of compliance. The first, compliance, occurs when a person conforms publicly, but in private keeps his own beliefs. People comply because of the need for approval of others and the fear of rejection. The second, identification, is consistent with a particular person who is well loved and respected, as a friend or family member. Identification is usually motivated by the attractiveness or success of the perceived model. Internalization is when people have actually internalized a group's belief system and see it as their own, both in public and in private. It is the deepest form of compliance and is likely to remain with people for a long time. The strength of compliance is well documented in psychological research. A researcher named Muzafer Sherif, for example, wanted to know how many people would change their opinions about something because of the desire to conform to a larger group."
"Seals belong to the Carnivora Order. Their closest relatives are bears, otters, weasel and raccoons. There are three types of seal families: the Odobenidae: the only living member (existing) is the walrus; the Otariidae: the auricular seals (sea lions and fur seals); and the Phocidae: the earless seals, or true seals. The smallest seal is the Baikal seal about 1 metre (3ft 3in) long and 45 kilograms (100lbs). The largest is the southern elephant seal, more than 5 metres (16ft) and 3 tons (6600lbs), which also makes it the largest carnivoran. Seals spend most of their life in water, but come to land to mate, give birth or escape predators, such as sharks and killer whales."
"It is a flower of pink orchid. There are more than 25,000 species of orchids. They grow on all continents except Antarctica. Orchids are many shapes, sizes and colors, from pure white to deep black. It is a pink rose. It is another rose. A rose is the most popular flower for bouquets, poetry, and is a romantic icon. It is a flower of pink hibiscus. Hibiscus flowers grow in warm climates. They are often used for decorations. Having a pleasant citrus flavour and as a source of vitamin C, they are also used in food and tea. It is a bud of pink lotus. A lotus is a flower that grows in water, and is a symbol of purity and life. A bud is a flower that has not opened. It is a pink Protea."
"Human sleep consists of different stages that can be distinguished by inspecting the recordings of electrical activity from sensors placed on someone's scalp, a method called electroencephalography. While dreams can occur during all stages of sleep, we dream most vividly in a stage of sleep known as ""RMS sleep"" due to the appearance of rapid eye movements. During REM sleep, all the muscles of the body (except eye muscles, of course) are paralyzed by neural structures in the brain stem, which prevents us from acting on our dreams."
"A national study of more than 1,000 subjects aged 8 to 18 across the United States revealed that almost all children play video games, but most (91.5%) do not have a serious problem. This is good – serious problems are not expected to be extremely common. However, it is not a small number of children. There are about 40 million children between the ages of 6 and 18 in the United States. If about 9 out of 10 video games, and about 8.5% of these players would be classified as dependent, which means that more than 3 million children are playing today to cause serious harm to their lives. These people are likely to get help, because we know that addiction can sometimes lead to quite serious problems."
"The coach put his hands on his hips. ""At this school, only boys are allowed to play football,"" he said. The boys told him to go play netball. They said netball is for girls and football is for boys. Andiswa was upset. The next day, the school had a big football game. The coach was worried because his best player was sick and couldn't play. Andiswa begged the coach, ""Please let me play."" The coach wasn't sure what to do. Then he decided that Andiswa could join the team. The game was difficult. No one scored a goal in the middle of the game. During the second half of the game, Andiswa got the ball. She moved very quickly to the goal. Andiswa hit the ball and scored a goal. The crowd went crazy with joy. Since that day, the girls were also allowed to play football at school."

A visitor who came to greet King Lion was Hyena. When Hyena arrived at the Lion's house, he found the king in bed. Lion said to him, ""I am sick of an incurable disease."" Hyena replied, ""O, Grand King, don't be sad because of your illness. Hare knows the cure for this disease."""

They asked Anansi the intelligent spider to help them. Anansi spun a long thread, and mounted his thread sticking up to heaven. ""Can I have the stories, please?"" he asked the God of heaven. Nyame laughed at Anansi and said, ""Oh, these are very expensive stories. You wouldn't be able to pay for them, little spider."" ""How much do the stories cost?"" asked Anansi.

Kato got rid of her throat and spoke shyly, ""I live in the far forest, maybe we can all go there."""
"Sophiatown, a place where South Africans could make music in harmony and dance together. But the people who governed the earth at the time didn't like this unity. These leaders didn't want Blacks and Whites to be friends. I knew it was wrong to treat people differently because of their skin color. I didn't hide my beliefs, and so these officials wanted me to go out of the country. When I sang in America, I was told that I could never go home. People from all over the world heard my story. My songs and my story helped a lot to see how there was no equity in South Africa for those who had black skin. I decided to continue singing and telling the truth about my country, no matter what. The world loved my music and I was welcomed in many countries. I won prizes and sang for important people all over the world."
"A long time ago, when the earth was new, great mountains covered the world as a blanket, and large trees climbed the sky. In this world, there was a large, dark, silent and cold pool. At the bottom of this pool were two snakes. One had thick snakes strongly shaped, and the other was smaller and more delicate. Then one day there was a great storm. A lightning flash pierced directly at the bottom of the pool. The waters separated for a moment. The snakes saw the earth above, full of colors and shapes and feathers. When the waters closed, the snakes could not forget the beauty they had seen. ""We can no longer stay in this dark cold pool,"" they said. ""Let's go up and see the earth above. ""How will we live on earth?"" said the smaller snake. ""Let's crawl on our stomachs?"" ""The birds of the air won't laugh at being so low,"" said his friend. ""We won't crawl, we will walk!"""
"When babies are born, they can neither speak nor understand words. A baby's communication is usually fundamental and non-verbal. Babies are not born with speech or tongue. This is something they learn from their interactions with others. In the first year of life, babies say their first words, and they can soon speak full sentences. After only 2-3 years, babies are already good enough in verbal communication and are able to say what they want. This rapid progress in language skills is probably supported by genetic conditions that support the rapid learning of the language. However, it is interesting to think that a baby has already taken the first steps in terms of language development before birth."
"Before the 8 weeks of play, we measured how the children in both training programs performed mental ability tests. After the 8 weeks of training, we tested both groups again, to see if they had improved on these tests. Children who had played games like SET have greatly improved the reasoning test and showed improvements in space work memory and one of the speed measurements. Children who had played games like Blink showed a different model: they got much faster on speed measurements but were no better on reasoning. These results show that playing different types of games can sharpen different mental skills. These are really exciting results! However, our work is not yet done."
"When she was a kid, Bass was very shy. She liked to sing and dance in her room all by herself. One day at netball school, the coach told two girls to pick teams. Bass stood on the edge of the field hoping someone would say, ""Come play with us!"" But nobody wanted her on their team. They didn't know much, Bass would become one of the most popular girls in the country. On the weekend, she and her brother and sisters helped their teaching mother and father bus driver pay the bills. They made sandwiches to sell to local football games. They tried to sell just as fast as they could so they could have had time to play with the other kids when the game was over."
"An old woman especially liked the smells that came out of the bakery window every morning. It was Ma Shenge who slept on a bench in the park every night. A few weeks before, a nice person had given her the money to buy a cinnamon bread. She had brought the bread back to the park and ate it very slowly, licking her lips and sharing the last crumbs with the birds. After that, although the old woman did not have enough money to buy breakfast, she again wanted the delicious bread. So, every morning she walked slowly beyond Mr. Shabangu's bakery, sniffing the air and smiling softly at the smell of the mouth. Ma Shenge's new habit made the baker very angry."

She saw Nosisa talking to the fish, and getting delicious food. Nosisa's secret was outside. ""I have to do something about this fish,"" said the mother-in-law. In the evening, Mpunzi returned from the fields. He found his new wife crying in her cabin. ""What's wrong with my beautiful wife,"" asked Mpunzi. ""I went to a traditional doctor,"" said the woman. ""He told me that the only way for me to give you a son is to eat the biggest fish that lives in this river,"" she said. ""Do you go catch the fish for me tonight?"" the woman said. ""I'll do everything for you, my beautiful wife,"" said Mpunzi."

He continued to fall until his back was very sore. Finally, he gave and walked away. He stopped and looked at the grape. He was hanged more than ever."
"""Whataat? Whataaat? Whataaat? Whataaat? What are you going to bring back for Yusuf?"" Dad rings his bell. ""Waaat and see what it will be!"" The fishermen watch the sun rise. They check their nets. They look at their trains. They listen to the wind. They drag their boats towards the water. Yusuf's grandfather, Oupa Salie was a treknet fisherman.

His neck stumps, his back muscles tear apart. Dad sings as he works: ""Drop and swish. Find a fish. Pull and plop. Don't stop. ""All day, Yusuf looks at the sky."
"One way the brain makes sure to remember the events that are important to us is to use specialized chemicals called neurotransmitters, which, when released, help to build stronger memories. Such a neurotransmitter is dopamine. Dopamine is released into the brain when something good happens, like walking in the classroom and finding a box of chocolates on your desk. When dopamine is released, it strengthens memories. It does so by labeling these memories when they are created in a way that makes these memories slowly strengthen over time. This means that just as memories for non-important things start to fade, memories for important things become stronger over time."
"My parents took me to the hospital for three years. I was very tired and I slept many hours every day. After three years, the doctors told me that I couldn't walk again. I was very sad because I love sports. I went to a special school in Umtata, and my teachers encouraged me. It was a very busy school, with a lot of activities like sports and sewing. At the weekend, we had to do tasks. We had to clean our rooms, polish our shoes and clean our wheelchairs. I decided to keep trying, and I never gave up. If you have a disability, you can always do something you like. I love seeing how far I can go, so I took part in a competition."
"Tselane didn't want to leave her old village and she started crying. Her mother was afraid to leave her daughter alone because giants lived in the caves near this village. But Tselane cried so much that her mother finally agreed that she could stay behind. Tselane's mother told her that she would bring food every day. She said, ""I'll sing a song so you know it's me. Don't open the door for anyone else, my child."" She sang the song: ""Tselane my child! Tselane my child! Get out and eat your porridge! Get out and eat your porridge! The next morning, Tselane's mother came home with food. She sang their special song. Tselane opened the door and took her mother's delicious food."
"The distinction between fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence is important because both are influenced by different factors. Although the former is more biologically determined and genetically predisposed, the latter is shaped more by experience. It is somewhat similar to what we know about sport: some people are more likely to develop stronger muscles than others, but it does not automatically transform them into world class athletes. On the contrary, they need many years of training and experience to do so at the top. Similarly, people need to apply their fluid intelligence to a particular area of knowledge, such as physics, history or neuroscience, to become really good at what they do."
"A little later, they passed to Ladybird. ""You are looking for something?"" Ladybird asked. ""Yes, Ladybird, I am looking for my house. Did you see it by any chance?"" Ladybird said, ""No, I don't have it, but I will help you look at it!"" She lifted herself on Tortoise's back and on him, with the snail and the Sparrow and Ladybird on her back. They looked and looked at it, but there was no sign of a house. A breeze began to blow. A little later, they passed the mouse. He made a guirland of daisies. ""You are looking for something?"" Mouse asked. ""Yes, Mouse, I am looking for my house. Have you seen, by any chance?"" Mouse said, ""No, I didn't have it, but I will help you look at it!"" She pulled herself on Tortoise's back. ""Wait, I can't leave my flowers behind."""
"Graça worked hard at school and as a teenager she received a gift that would change her life. It was a scholarship to attend a rich city school. She dreamed of becoming a teacher and using her education to educate others. She wanted the children of her beloved Mozambique to know reading and learning. She dreamed of a moment when all the children were going to school. Graça did her best in this city school and years later she was blessed again. It was another scholarship to attend a university in Portugal far away. She met new friends, learned new languages and read an abundance of books. She realized her dream of becoming a teacher. All this made Graça very happy. There was only one thing that made her sad again."
"Rini's father soon brought him a puppy. He was a white puppy with a very soft fur. Rini named him Bhujar. Bhujar was full of energy! Her father taught Rini to take care of a puppy. He said, ""You have to feed her and clean her regularly. Then she will know how to be faithful."" Rini took care of Bhujar every day. Rini gave baths to Bhujar, and took her away for walks and adventures. Bhujar loved Rini, and Rini loved Bhujar. Wherever Rini went, Bhujar went with her. But Bhujar was not allowed to go to school with Rini. When Rini went to school, Bhujar had to stay alone at home. One day, Bhujar followed Rini to school. She moved around Rini, barking and jumping. ""Bhujar, why do you come with me?"" Rini had to school."
"A long time ago, Hare and Hyena were great friends. They did a lot of things together. They danced and sang together. One day, Hare said, ""My friend Hyena, let's start growing together and we'll be rich."" ""Oh yes, we can plant a lot of food, harvest, and sell it to others,"" Hyena said. ""But what should we plant?"" asked Hare. Hyena suggested that it was good to plant corn. Hare agreed. Hare also told Hyena that it was good for them to share tasks on the farm. ""My job will be to protect corn from birds,"" said Hare. So Hare told Hyena to land, plant, and grass. Hyena complained that he had been given more work. But Hare said that hunting birds was the hardest and most important. ""My job is not easy. I'm going to climb trees and hunt birds day and night."
"In a village on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa, a little girl worked in the fields with her mother. Her name was Wangari. Wangari liked to be outside. In her family's food garden, she broke the ground with her machete. She pressed small seeds into the hot ground. Her favorite time was just after sunset. When it was too dark to see the plants, Wangari knew it was time to go home. She followed narrow paths through the fields, crossing the rivers as she went. Wangari was an intelligent child and couldn't wait to go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home. When she was seven years old, her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to school. She loved to learn! Wangari learned more and more with every book she read. She did so well at school that she was invited to study in the United States. Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world. At the new university of American Wangari learned a lot about things."
"Abike arrived at her grandmother's house. ""What a nice surprise Abike! Look at this new basket that I made. Do you like it?"" Grandma asked. ""I love the colors, but the shapes are too sharp and sharp,"" Abike replied. ""How would you copy the pattern on the basket? Are the shapes like a square or a rectangle or another shape? On her way back, Abike lost the way. She was not sure where she was, so she sat down to rest under a tree. Abike looked at the dancing leaves on the branches above. There were patterns of light and shadow all around her. Soon she fell into deep sleep."
"The hill of Olokwango stood smiling in the middle of the plains of Kwere. For its part, sources approached the descent to form the Temu River. Its waters were a gift for the sheep and goats of the area as well as the deer who lived in the plains. Everything went well until Matata became chief. He ordered a way to be clear from the top of the hill to the foot so that he could easily climb and roll gently to the foot. Olokwango Hill was angry at the damage caused to his beard, but he was patient. During the weekend, Matata's children and their friends climbed the hill to play. They ran all over the square, breaking branches and twigs, lighting fires for their games, which they would let burn later. Over time, Olokwango would lose patience."
"One of the things I can do because I'm autistic — it's a capacity rather than a handicap — is that I have a very, very lively imagination. Let me explain it to you a bit. It's like I'm walking in two worlds most of the time. There's the real world, the world we all share, and there's the world in my mind, and the world in my mind is often much more real than the real world. Like, it's very easy for me to let my mind loose because I'm not trying to put myself in a little box. It's one of the best things about being autistic. You don't want to do that. You find what you want to do, you find a way to do it, and you continue. If I tried to fit into a box, I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have realized half of the things I have now."
"One day, Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. ""Where are you, my child?"" he called. Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. ""I want you to meet someone special, my child. It's Anita,"" he said smiling. ""Hello Simbegwire, your father told me a lot about you,"" Anita said. ""But she doesn't smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited. He talked about the three of them living together, and how good their lives would be. ""My child, I hope you will accept Anita as your mother,"" he said. Simbegwire's life has changed."
"Once upon a time, at the Orange Grove in Joburg, a little girl named Phyllis was born in the world. Two people in love raised their sweet little girl. No one knew then what a dancer they had done. At the age of four, she had learned very quickly. She impressed all her teachers with her duck-footed flicks! Before school and after, she danced every day. Nothing more enjoyable than ballet Phyllis. When the world was ready for Phyllis at the age of fifteen, she arrived in a big, old London, ready to live her dream. She said goodbye to all her friends. She was ready to start freshly."
"The king thundered, ""My royal astrologer, tell me what I must do to become emperor of the whole universe."" ""Your Majesty,"" replied the astrologer, ""the stars say that there is a hundred percent chance that you will become emperor of the whole universe."" ""Wonderful, bravo!"" Everyone in the royal court began to applaud. The royal astrologer opened his mouth to stay something more, but stopped. The king noticed his hesitation and said to him, ""Tell me what is in your mind. Don't be afraid!"" The astrologer said, ""Your majesty, we have an amazing golden bird living in our kingdom. If you can catch this golden bird, no one can stop you from becoming emperor of the whole universe."" The king said, ""This golden bird must be taken."
"One day, the children put the baby under a tree in the shade on a bright red blanket. They went to play. The baby started crying as usual. A group of cranes flew over the playground and felt sorry for the crying baby. They tried to get the kids to notice that the baby was crying but the kids continued to play. The cranes decided to take the baby and lift it themselves. Four cranes came to pick up the baby from under the tree. Each crane took a corner of the baby's blanket, raised the baby and fled. The kids didn't notice anything because they were busy playing. The parents of the children were working hard in the hot sun. It was so hot that the mother decided to rest under a tree. While she was resting she heard her baby crying. She looked around and she couldn't see anything."
"A long time ago, birds had a meeting. They wanted a king, like people and animals. What bird should be king? ""Eagle, he is strong and king!"" said a bird. ""No, he has no crown, and when he calls, he sounds too sad,"" said another. ""Then Ostrich, because he is the greatest and roaring like a lion,"" one called. ""No, he can't fly. The king of birds must be able to fly. ""I think I should be king,"" said Peacock, venturing his tail. ""I am so beautiful."" ""You are too proud,"" said Owl. ""I have the biggest eyes of any bird. I should be king. ""No, you, Owl,"" shouted the other birds. ""You go to sleep when the sun rises!"" And they didn't go very far with choosing a king."
"Once upon a time, Lion was the strongest and most feared of all animals. He caught other animals and ate them. But one morning, as he was looking for breakfast, he got caught in a hunter's trap. Lion made his strongest roar. He got away and got away from the trap. The trap got tighter and tighter around his leg every time he was shooting. The lion got tired and he felt more pain in his leg. Finally, he gave up. Days passed as Lion cooked in the sun. He was hungry and thirsty and there was no one to save him. He became weaker and weaker. ""I'm going to die of hunger and thirst in this trap,"" he thought. One morning, Lion heard a noise coming from nearby bushes. He listened and looked closer. He saw Warthog walk with his family, talk and laugh."
"Once upon a time there was a man who had much of everything – a great fertile farm, with cattle, sheep and goats. But, as he was getting old, he became sad, because one thing was missing. He had no wife. He was standing under a tree one day, he had a brilliant idea. If he could not find a woman, perhaps he could make one? Then he began to work to shape a beautiful woman from a strong branch of the tree. When he had finished making the statue, he touched his eyes, and they opened. He breathed slowly upon her, and she became alive. She was truly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He knelt before her, and asked her to be his wife. He gave her a colorful apron, pearls and a ring of head, the sign of a married woman."
"""It's a good life in the hills,"" said the husband. ""You should come there too."" Soon the other families left the flat ground and climbed up to the hills. Each family found a cave to live, and felt warm and safe. Soon the children became very quick to climb the rocks, and find fruit in the trees. They could swing into the branches almost as well as any monkey. Slowly, things started to change. The children spoke less, and grunt more. Then the adults noticed that their nose was growing and they were growing more hair. Every time they looked at each other, they saw that their teeth were longer. They started to walk on four legs. They became a new creature that no one had seen before at this place. It's the creature that people now call the baboon."
"We are the only species that has developed languages with a set of rules (a grammar) that requires words to be in a certain order. You may have seen monkeys called each other (e.g., a ""koo"" call signals conviviality), but you have never seen anyone write a letter and ask you questions about spelling! We are also able to predict from the look of a friend's face or the sound of his voice how he feels about the world, whether he is happy or sad. Moreover, we pass from generation to generation the knowledge we have learned about the world and our universe – that's why we are going to school! Going to school and teaching children about the world is part of the human ""culture"", another characteristic specific to man. Language, predicting a friend's mood, and culture are all examples of ""human-specific"" abilities."
"When they were almost at home, Nozibele put her hand on her neck. She had forgotten her necklace! ""Please come back with me!"" she begged her friends. But her friends said it was too late. Nozibele returned to the river alone. She found her necklace and started to hurry home. But, she got lost in the dark. In the distance, she saw the light coming from a cabin. She walked quickly to her and knocked at the door. To her surprise, a dog opened the door and said, ""What do you want?"" ""I am lost and I need a place to sleep,"" said Nozibele."
"One day, Dima decided to visit Owl. When they served food, Dima wondered why Owl's food tasted so good. He wondered if it was because the food was growing in the sun and it was cooked on fire. In secret, Dima made a plan. He decided to dance. He wanted everyone in Owl to gather around him and see him dance. He was a good dancer. Owl and his family admired the beautiful dance. When he became dark, Owl decided to look for the sun in his house so that he could still watch Dima's dance. Owl kept the sun in a bag of animal skin inside his cabin."
"One morning, old Jackal woke up to find his son who was sleeping in the sun. The food was not ready and the goats were still in the kraal! ""You young man, you are so lazy! Go find a woman. I am too old to take care of you,"" said Jackal's father. ""Then Jackal jumped and took the goats to feed. In the bush, he saw something shining on a rock. He approached the rock more and more. The closer he approached, the more beautiful the shine was. Maybe it was the woman for him!"" ""You are beautiful,"" said Jackal to the shine. ""But who are you? Why are you alone?"" ""I am the sun,"" replied the shine."
"Once upon a time in a mountainous village in Africa he lived a famous blacksmith. The villagers called him Ratshipi - the man of iron and steel. Ratshipi was known by everyone in the village. Villagers went to his shop every morning to see him work. He seemed to be able to do anything with his iron and steel. Kgosi Mogale, the village chief, heard about Ratshipi's work. He sent his servants to take Ratshipi to the palace. Ratshipi was happy to hear that Kgosi Mogale wanted to see him. ""I will be very happy to work for the chef,"" he said. So Ratshipi went to the palace. ""Ratshipi, I heard about your good work,"" said Kgosi Mogale. ""I want you to do a very special task."" ""With your iron and steel, I want you to build a man who can walk, cry with real tears and bleed with true human blood."""
"The grandma's garden was wonderful. It was full of sorghum, millet and cassava. But the best of all were bananas. Although grandmother had many grandchildren, I secretly knew that I was her favorite. She often invited me to her house. She also told me about little secrets. But there was a secret that she didn't share with me. Where she ripened bananas. One day I saw a large basket of straw placed in the sun outside of Grandma's house. When I asked what it was, the only answer I had was: ""It's my magic basket."" Next to the basket, there were several banana leaves that Grandma rotated from time to time. I was curious."
"On that day, they were cows at the market. ""Put those stupid cows away,"" she said. ""They eat my vegetables."" ""Hey you there! Push these stupid cows away from here,"" she insisted. ""They eat my clothes."" ""Where is the owner of these stupid cows?"" she cried. ""They eat my grains."" Sorimpan, the flock, had just been drinking water at the tap when his cows were wandering at the market. He was hiding, squatting in fear, when he heard the screaming woman. ""Look what these stupid cows did!"" she continued shouting. ""They broke my beautiful pots."" Shortly afterwards, ""Aah! Not yet!"" she said. ""I'm going to bring this matter back to the police. These stupid cows have dropped my fruit stand."" Sorimpan finally came out by hand, messed up between the crowds and managed to get a clear view of his cows."
"One day Nyame decided to give the pot of wisdom to Anansi. Every time Anansi looked in the pot of clay, he learned something new. It was so exciting! Greedy Anansi said to himself: ""I will keep the pot safe at the top of a large tree. Then I can have everything for me!"" He spun a long thread, blocked it around the pot of clay, and bound it to his stomach. He began to climb the tree. But it was difficult to climb the tree with the pot that grunted him in his knees all the time. All the time, the young son of Anansi stood at the bottom of the tree. He said: ""Wouldn't it be easier to climb if you were binding the pot on your back?"" Anansi tried to bind the pot of clay full of wisdom to his back, and it was really much easier."
"One day, they decided to play football to see who was the best player. They went to the football field and started their game. Chicken was fast, but Millipede was faster. Poulet kicked away, but Millipede kicked further. Poulet started to feel angry. They decided to play a penalty shot. Premier Millipede was goaltender. Poulet scored a single goal. Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal. Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede ripped the ball and scored. Millipede headed towards the ball and scored. Millipede scored five goals! Poulet was furious that she lost. She was a very bad loser. Millipede started laughing because her friend was making such an agitation. Poulet was so angry that she opened her wide beak and swallowed Milliped Millipede."
"And they went to the house, and struck; and the door was opened, and they went in; and the young men saw no one; but they heard a voice greeting them. And the voice said to them, ""I am a louse; open the pot of metal, and have food; open the pot of faience, and drink of the amahewu."" Then the louse put on his skin and went out. The young men ate, drank, and gave thanks. Then they left the house. As they went away, they had a bad thought. They said, ""No, it did not happen that we had food of a louse."" Finally, they agreed to go back and crush the louse. They returned home and crushed the louse. Suddenly, the louse went away, and the house disappeared. They found themselves outside."
"The sniffles didn't want to be a crocodile. ""I'm so ugly,"" he thought, bursting in tears. He didn't even want to live like crocodiles. His best friend was Punch, a yellow butterfly of gold. And Punch wanted to be big and strong. So, Punch always had his feeler wrapped in a fist saying, ""Look, I'm going to hit you in the mouth."" They made a very funny pair. Sniffles swimming with Punch perched on his head. The other crocodiles laughed and laughed at them. It didn't bother Sniffles. He continued crying, sniffing and being friends with Punch. A sunny afternoon, Punch settled by the ear of Sniffles and told him, ""I saw two men coming by with guns, they want to kill the crocodiles for their skins."""
"One of the girls said, ""My mother loves me the most."" Another said, ""My father loves me the most."" But the third said, ""I am loved by both parents."" The giant asked the beloved girl of both parents to help her carry firewood. So, the girl followed the giant.They walked for a distance. The girl asked the giant, ""Where is your firewood?"" The giant replied, ""It's close to those trees there!"" When she reached the trees, the girl asked, ""Where is your firewood?"" The giant replied, ""Not yet!"" They met a man on the way. He asked the giant, ""What's your child's name?"" The giant replied, ""She's called the talk bag."" The girl broke out singing."
"There are usually two types of air navigation depending on the weather. In good weather, pilots navigate visually with maps. But when the weather is bad and they do not see the ground, they use special radio navigation instruments or the air traffic controller navigates them. The first type of navigation is called VFR (visual flight rules) navigation. The second type is IFR (instrument flight rules) navigation. Under visual flight rules, pilots use a map and compass, and look at the ground. When preparing for a flight, they choose large points visible on the map, such as large cities, lakes, hills, rivers, roads or forests. When they are in the air, they look for the points chosen to make sure that they are walking. Time must be sufficient to allow them to see the ground. They cannot fly in the clouds, because they can be lost."
"The flies have very different eyes than ours. Their eyes are called ""composed eyes"" because each eye is actually hundreds of small eyes composed together. Each small eye has its own lens, stems and cones, and transmits a unique signal to the fly's brain. Although you have heard differently, even if the flies have compound eyes, they always see an image, just like us. It's because each small eye in the compound eye is pointed in a slightly different direction, so the light it feels is separated from the other small eyes. The way a fly sees is similar to the way an image is formed on a computer. If you think of an image on a computer, it is composed of many pixels that are in different places. Like pixels in an image on a computer, the information of the small different eyes is put together to form an image. In this case, the fly's brain puts all the information of the small eyes together to make an image of what the fly sees."
"Kim was happy to have found a summer job. ""Let's go see Mom,"" she said. ""She'll finish teaching when we're there."" Kim held hands to greet a taxi. A yellow taxi stopped on the side of the street. ""Where to do?"" asked the driver. Kim told him the address. They did it safely. Kim paid the driver. She and Kurt went to see their mother. Mrs. Gunter made a big hug to Kim. Kurt sneaked in so that he could be part of the hug, too. Then Kim told her mother how they had spent the day. She told her mother how she had used math to help her get the job at the grocery store. At the end of the story, Ms. Gunter was teleporting. ""You see,"" she said. ""I told you that math wouldn't help you one day."" ""I never dreamed that I would have a job in a grocery store."""
"A discreet transformation of the cosine is a mathematical process that can be used to do things like MP3s, and JPEGs smaller. It does so by breaking the sound or image into different frequencies. One way to calculate a discrete transformation of the cosine is to use Fourier's transformation. ""discrete"" means that it works on signals in discrete time (sampled data). For sounds, the frequencies are the same as simple tones. You can make any sound by playing multiple tones at the same time. The discreet transformation of the cosine is a way to know what tones to play to make a given sound. The only difference between the tones is their location."
"A DNA build can express wild-type proteins, or prevent the expression of certain genes by expressing competitors or inhibitors. It can express mutant proteins, such as suppression mutations or erroneous mutations. A DNA build is often used in molecular biology to analyze macromolecules such as proteins or RNA in more detail. A molecular biology vector is a DNA molecule used as a vehicle to transfer foreign genetic material into another cell. The main types of vectors are plasmids, bacteriophages and other viruses, and artificial chromosomes."
"There are different types of mechanoreceptors (receptors affected by the touch). In hairy skin, the hair follicular receptor is the main mechanoreceptor. In addition, hairy skin contains fibers that react well to slow stroking with a soft brush, and the stimulation of these fibers results in a pleasant touch experience. Unhaired skin contains four main types of mecanoreceptors, which can be divided into two functional groups. The first group contains mecanoreceptors that adapt quickly, which respond only at the beginning, and frequently at the end, to a touch, but not between the two. The second group consists of slowly adapting mecanoreceptors, which respond slowly to the appearance of a touch, but continue to respond to the medium. The density of mecanoreceptors varies in different parts of the body."
"Electronic crystallography is a method for determining the arrangement of atoms in solids using an electronic transmission microscope (TEM). This method works in many cases where X-ray crystallography does not work. Protein structures are usually made from two-dimensional crystals (sheets or helises), polyhedrals such as viral capsides or dispersed proteins. Electrons can be used in these situations, whereas X-rays cannot, because electrons interact more strongly with atoms than X-rays. Electronic crystallography is a method for determining the arrangement of atoms in solids using an electronic transmission microscope (TEM). The method was invented by Aaron Klug, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for this, and his studies on viral structures and RNA transfer in 1982."
"Researchers all over the world spend more and more time studying friendship. It is proven that our brain responds more strongly to friends than strangers, even if the stranger has more in common with us. Spending time with friends has been shown to cause more activity in the parts of the brain that makes us feel good – reward circuits. Moreover, having valuable long-term social relationships, including friendships, and active social life seems to protect the brain from diseases later in life such as dementia, the loss of nerve cells in the brain that affects the brain of many older adults. In short, the brain's contribution to human social interactions is complex and not yet fully understood."
"There are many experimental studies using mainly mice and rats that show that, when these animals are raised in enriched environments, they exceed those raised in unenriched cages in terms of learning, memory and visual acuity.These studies suggest that multiple circuits in the brain are altered, leading to an improvement in cognitive abilities. At the micro-anatomical level, for example, an enriched environment has led to an increase in neuronal complexity in the cerebral cortex. Similarly, studies in the cerebral cortex of humans with different levels of education have reported an increase in neuronal complexity as levels of education increase. Thus, the idea is not to try to sculpt our brain to become a genius, but rather to make the most of our own genetic makeup through education to increase our cognitive abilities."
"When they stopped looking at the bird, the rain stopped falling. The crops started to dry and die, and the animals became thin and weak. Yet, no one in the village went into the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now, they were all too busy looking for money to buy food in the nearby city. One day a young girl named Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. ""At least he will be cool in there,"" she thought. She walked and walked, and after a while she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti looked at the tree. Suddenly, she remembered how her grandmother had taken her to the forest to feed the bird when she was still a little child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left from her lunch."
"As we grow up, we are often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness, just another childish thing to throw away like baby teeth or roller skates. And I think it's not a coincidence that we think this way. Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard to handle to be optimistic. That's perhaps why we think of fear, sometimes as a danger in themselves. ""Don't worry,"" we like to tell each other. ""Don't panic."" In English, fear is something we conquer. It's something we fight. It's something we overcome. But what if we look at fear in a new way? And if we thought of fear as an amazing act of imagination, something that can be as profound and perceptive as history is told?"
"Greeny doesn't want to take a nap. Today she wants to be a tree! Trees don't need naps! Trees can play all day. Trees must only be green. Uh-oh. Dad can't find Greeny. She hides among the trees. It's so fun to be a tree! But it's a little hot to play under the sun, right? Actually, it's too hot! What should Greeny do? What should Greeny do? Should she go home to Dad? But where is the house? Greeny is lost! Dad is looking for Greeny. Greeny continues to walk until she reaches a river."
"Described in the scientific literature more than 30 years ago, the feeling of loneliness is characterized by a sense of social isolation or on the social perimeter. It is remarkable that the feeling of loneliness does not necessarily mean being physically alone. Solitude is a difference between the relationships that one wants and the relationships that one has, so that one can feel socially isolated even when they are friends. Like celebrity, George Clooney, said, ""Everyone would lie if he said that he did not sometimes feel alone. The loneliness that one will get is in the greatest audience of the arenas: we will go to a place and end up in the smallest possible compartment, because it is a distraction for everyone, and we end up not enjoying it like everyone else."" Although solitude makes people sad, it has another less obvious effect on our brain and biology: it triggers a feeling in which the world is dangerous, and the brain is tilting towards a mode of self-preservation."
"I'm going to plant corn seeds for the new season. I have to hurry. My parents' seeds have already sprouted. Bird herds continue to fly to eat the seeds. Cats and I have to hunt them. ""Flyaway, bad birds!"" we shout. A few days later, a single germ appears. I call it Green Top. I read books to Green Top to grow up quickly. When Green Top is thirsty, I water it. Cats and I play hide-and-seek with Green Top. I bring a new kind of food for Green Top. It's called fertilizer. Green Top grows every day. One day, I see the bees talking to the other plants. They say that corn is on its way! I run quickly to Green Top. My parents are happy. Why Green Top is so sad? I ask his friends. ""Does anyone know why Green Top is sad?"" The snail doesn't do."
"It is important that you know that the scale of the map is determined by the area of the real world covered by the map. Almost all the maps have scales. Scales play an important role in maintaining the dimensional accuracy of a map. The following types of scales are used: 1:24000 scale This type of scale is known as a scale of ratio and which means that a centimeter (cm) on a map is equal to 24,000 cm (or 2 km) in the real world. In fact, this means that one of the elements (mm, cm, etc.) on the map is equal to 24,000 of the same things on the map. Another way of writing it would be a fractional scale of 1/24 000, which means that the objects on the map have been reduced to 1/24 000th of their original size. Very interesting. Other scale maps in use for topographic maps are 1:25 000, 1: 50,000 and 1: 250,000. Did you know that the ratio is smaller between distances on the map and distances in the real world, the smallest scale is said to be the map'."
"She didn't even cry when her mother combed her hair. The moment Anu entered Aunt's house, she shouted, ""Aunty! Where is the baby?"" ""Shhhhhhh... said Aunt Jui, with her finger on her lips. ""Soft. The baby sleeps."" Sleeping? What a boredom. Anu started to shudder. Aai pulled Anu near. ""The baby is still very small, Anu. You don't have to bother him. After all, you are her big sister!"" Great sister! Anu felt very important. But why did the baby have to go to sleep? Just then they heard a fine moaning... ""She's standing up,"" said Aunt, and gave the baby to Aai. ""I want to hold the baby,"" said Anu. ""Oh no, Anu. You won't be able."
"A week after the discovery of the whales, the director of NOAA's National Marine Mammal Laboratory, Howard Braham, asked me to go and work with the press and make sure they had accurate information about these incredible creatures. It was frozen — about 30 to 40 degrees under zero every day during the rescue, so not at all like the average of whale stalls at the beach. It was in October in Alaska and everyone on the stage had to endure many difficult conditions to be there. Meanwhile, it was a total zoo in Barrow with all the journalists there. At the time, we did not know why it had caught the attention of the whole world, but all the eyes were on us. The whales were relatively young and confused. All the other grey whales had begun to migrate much earlier, but these three whales remained in the feeding areas too long."
"The mathematicians have proven that the hexagonal pattern on the comb is the best way to divide a region into cells of equal surface area. The amount of wax required, and the energy spent by the working bees, are kept to a minimum. The cells are all exactly the same size. There are about four cells per square centimeter or 25 square inches. This section is all about the surface measurements of the shapes. You will estimate the zones and use these estimates to ensure that your responses to surface problems are reasonable. Some of the problematic situations you will encounter in this section concern areas of two-dimensional shapes such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms and circles. In addition, you will explore the surface of prisms, pyramids, cylinders and cones. You will also study how to change the dimensions of geometric shapes affect the perimeters and areas of these shapes."
"After the First Punic War, Rome took on the task of uniting Italy under Roman rule. They subdued the Gauls and, by the treaty of Ebro with Hasdrubal the Fair, fixed the border between Rome and the Carthage empires in Spain to the river of Ebro. Rome would control all the territories north of the river and Carthage these territories to the south. The Gauls saw the Romans as conquerors and occupants and thus, when Hannibal began his operations on the Iberian peninsula, they did little to stop it. He had not only the support of the people, but also, if not, the devotion of his army. Only 28 years after taking command, Hannibal had spent most of his life in the camps of the army in the field. The historian Durant, quoting Livy, wrote: ""He was the first to enter the battle and the last to abandon the field."""
"Sharks are a kind of fish that lives in all the world's oceans. Scientists think sharks lived 200 million years before dinosaurs. It's a long time ago! Teeth of a giant shark that lived millions of years ago. There are many different types of sharks. See if you can tell which shark is a hammerhead shark, which is a tiger shark and is a large white shark. Sharks come of all sizes. Whale sharks are the largest fish in the world. It can reach 45 feet long. Other sharks can be small, like leopard sharks. The smallest sharks are only seven inches long. Some sharks are born alive but others hatch from an egg. Babies are called small sharks. A mother shark does not take care of its babies after birth. They need to take care of themselves. Sharks are deadly predators, which means they hunt and eat other animals like fish, seals and even other sharks."
"Bhabhloo was a very, very naughty bear, loved by everyone in the jungle, but above all, by his mother. But he was really very naughty. From early in the morning to late night, Bhabhloo jumped and played and ran into the jungle and his mother called after him. ""Bhabhloo, beta, don't be so naughty."" ""Bhabhloo, rest a little..."" ""Oh no, Bhabhloo, you'll be hurt, beta, be careful!"" ""Bhabhloo, it's late now, it's night, will sleep now, son..."" Ma would keep trying to control Bhabhloo, and Bhabhloo full of beans would think about new things to do, not listen to a word his mother said. It's a story about just such a night. Mom was very tired."
"Known as the cradle of civilization, Fertile Crescent is considered the birthplace of agriculture, urbanization, writing, commerce, science, history and organized religion and was first populated about 10,000 B.C. when farming and domestication of animals began in the region. In 9,000 B.C., the cultivation of wild cereals was widespread and in 5,000 B.C., irrigation of agricultural crops was fully developed. In 4,500 B.C., the cultivation of woolly sheep was widely practised. The first cities began to grow (Eridu, the first, according to the Sumerians, in 5400 B.C., then Uruk and the others) around 4,500 B.C. and the cultivation of wheat and cereals was practised, in addition to domestication of animals (by 3,500 B.C., the image of the breed of dogs was regularly shown on the murals of the others)."
"Living things are different from things that are not alive. It is generally easy to say what is alive and what is not, except with really small ""microscopic"" life forms and colorless, lifeless foams. Here are some properties of living things. Some non-living things can have some of these properties. Living things can change and grow. However, volcanoes change and grow. Living things can move. However, the wind moves from the air, and the water always moves down. You probably want to know how plants can move. They can grow, and sometimes move faster than that, in response to things like the sun or water. An example is that sunflowers will turn during the day so that they are always facing the sun. Another example is that if a plant gets rocked, it will want to turn upwards. Living things can reproduce."
"I was lucky — I found what I liked to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20 years old. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown up just us both in a garage at a $2 billion company with more than 4000 employees. We just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just been 30 years old. And then I was fired. How can you get fired from a business you started? Well, as Apple grew up, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the business with me, and for the first year or things went well."
"In Africa, they say that a male lion roams Ha inchi na yanni? Yangu, yangu, yangu! (Who is this land? It's mine, mine, mine!) It's hard to listen to this ancient challenge without getting close to the campfire. But what's behind this remarkable call? Certainly, to some extent, cats are cats all over the world. You look at one of the neighborhood tabbies tracking a squirrel and you can see in miniature a tiger tracking deer on the meadows of Rhanthambore. Yet, in part because they are so majestic, these great cats are different from the feline of the neighbour."
"In May 1774, in retaliation for the ""Boston Tea Party"", Parliament closed Boston Harbour and virtually abolished provincial autonomy in Massachusetts. These actions stimulated resistance across the earth. In the summer, the lower house of Massachusetts, through correspondence committees, secretly invited the 13 colonies to attend an assembly. In response, on the fifth of September, 55 delegates representing 12 colonies, with the exception of Georgia, gathered in Philadelphia. They met at Carpenters' Hall and organized the first Continental Congress. By sharing joint complaints against the Crown, delegates presented a wide variety of political opinions. Most of them agreed that Parliament had no right to control the internal affairs of the colonies. The moderates, emphasizing the commercial advantages with the mother country, believed that Parliament should continue to regulate trade."
"Chameli's mother had a lot of beautiful jewels. One day, Chameli's mother showed her all the jewels and also taught her their names. The next day, Chameli secretly took out her mother's sirfhula (a golden head flower) and carried it. With the sirfhula on her head, she went to school. On her way, she met her friends Champa and Sohan. They were surprised to see the sirfool on her head. At school, Chameli was the center of attention. Everyone looked at her and talked about her. Nalantara composed a stupid song: Look at this girl, who is it? Why, it's Chameli, in her Gorkha hat!"
"The whole house was built on the plane of a T, but a T with a very long piece of cross and a very short piece of tail. The long piece of cross was the front that ran across the street, with the entrance door in the middle; it was two floors high and contained almost all the important rooms. The short piece of tail, which ran at the back immediately in front of the front door, was a tall story, and consisted only of two long rooms, one leading to the other. The first of these two rooms was the study in which the famous M. Quinton wrote his wild poems and novels. The other room was a glass conservatory full of tropical flowers of quite unique and almost monstrous beauty, and on these bright afternoons of magnificent sun. So, when the lobby door was open, many passers stopped literally to look and waste; for he looked at a prospect of rich apartments to something really like a transformation scene in a game of fairies: purple clouds and bright golden suns that were both were bright and bright."
"The nurse looked at the man in astonishment, for she had never treated a death as speculation, and she hesitated, tempted by the idea of the possible gain, but she suspected that he wanted to play him a trick. ""I can't say anything until I saw your mother,"" she replied. ""Then come with me and see her."" She washed her hands, and went with him immediately. They didn't talk on the road; she walked with short hasty steps, while he stretched with his long legs, as if he was crossing a stream at every step."
"The armies fought as they had fought, on open ground, on long, two- and three-row flying infantry lines, as it was the most rational way to use the weapons they possessed. The main weapon of this battle was the smooth-bore musket, equipped with a 16-inch bayonet. There was a lead ball of an ounce of 70 to 80 metres in diameter, but the distance was of little importance. The aim was to break the enemy formations with volleyballs and to cast them down with cold steel. The British were the masters of these linear tactics, and Washington and his commanders passed the war by trying to inflate the same discipline in their continentals so that they could stand on a par with the red vests in the battle."
"It should be noted that my sister-in-law, with a lack of logic which must have been proper to herself, treated my complexion almost as an offence for which I was responsible, by hastening to assume this external sign of the inner qualities which I protested against all my innocence; and this unjust inference which she sought to support by stressing the inutility of the life that I had led. Well, that is, that for so long, I had taken a lot of pleasure and a lot of knowledge. I had been in a German school and a German university and spoke German as easily and perfectly as English; I was completely at home in French; I had a touch of Italian and enough Spanish to swear. I am, I believe, a strong man, but barely a beautiful sabre and a good shot. I could mount everything that had a back to sit; and my head was as cool as you could find, for all its flamboyant cover."
"About a year after the family left Oklahoma, Will Johnson got a neighbor boy to go with him in their place in Texas to bring another shipment of household goods. They had left about two weeks. While the family was in Oklahoma, Will — who was about 20 years old — taught two terms at the school in Nubbin Ridge, somewhere near Duncan. Simpson, about 17 at the time, was not about to go to school to a teacher who was his elder brother, so he saddled his horse and slipped into Melvin's ranch, to be with his brother Joe. He said he was tired of riding but not as tired as his horse. The trip was about 300 miles. He was on the trail three days and nights and had to stop at times to let his horse rest."
"Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I felt it my duty to persevere — to do everything possible to complete the mandate that you have elected me to. However, in recent days it has become clear to me that I no longer have a strong political base in Congress to justify the continuation of this effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly necessary to see the constitutional process until its conclusion; what else would be unfaithful to the spirit of this deliberately difficult process, and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future. But with the disappearance of this base, I now believe that the constitutional goal has been served. And there is no need for the process to be prolonged. I would have preferred to complete whatever personal agony it might have involved, and my family urged me to do so unanimously. But the interests of the nation must always come before any personal consideration."
"Jacob lived in the land where his father had remained, the land of Canaan. This is the account of Jacob's lineage. Joseph, a seventeen-year-old boy, took care of the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, and told their father bad news about them. Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he was born to him in his old age; and he made him adorned robe. His brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, and they hated him and could not speak a good word to him. Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers, they hated him even more. He said to them, ""Listen to this dream that I had, We bound wheat sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf stood up and stood up, and your sheaves gathered around me and bowed to her."""
"Others will debate controversial issues, national and international, that divide the minds of men, but serene, calm, distant, you are the guardians of the nation's war, its rescuers of the currents of international conflicts, its gladiators in the arena of battle. For a century and a half, you have defended, preserved and protected its sacred traditions of freedom and freedom, of law and of justice. Let the civil voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of government. Let our strength be undermined by the financing of the forgiving deficit for too long, by overly powerful federal paternalism, by overly arrogant power groups, by too corrupt politics, by overly rampant crime, by too weak morals, by too high taxes, by too violent extremists; let our personal freedoms be as firm and complete as they should be. These great national problems are not for your professional participation or for a military solution."
"Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite the fact that the scientific workforce of this nation doubles every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole, despite this, the vast expanses of the unknown and the incomplete and still far from our collective understanding. No man can fully grasp how far and at what speed we have come, but condensing, if you wish, the 50,000 years of the history of man recorded in a time period of half a century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them the advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them. Then, about 10 years ago, under this norm, the man came out of his caves to build other types of shelter. Only five years ago the man learned to write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago."
"Therefore, I am delighted to come to Michigan, to this university, because if we do not have these resources in this school, unless you understand the nature of what is being asked of you, this country cannot go through the next 10 years in a period of relative strength. So I come here tonight to go to bed! But I also come here tonight to ask you to participate in the effort... This university... this is the longest speech I've ever made... so, I'm going to finish it! Let me say in conclusion, this university is not maintained by its elders, or by the state, just to help its graduates have an economic advantage in the struggle for life. There is certainly a bigger goal, and I'm sure you recognize it. Therefore, I'm not sorry to ask for your support in this campaign. I come here tonight to ask for your support for this country over the next decade."
"But it didn't help Washington. The governments of the American bloc moved to the base of the moon in the first year. There wasn't much else to do. Europe had gone; a pile of slag growing ashes and bones. Most of North America was useless; nothing could be planted, no one could live. A few million people continued to go up to Canada and down to South America. But in the second year, Soviet paratroopers began to fall, some first, and then more and more. They wore the first really effective anti-radiation material; what remained of American production was moving to the moon with the governments."
"The Explorer was not comfortable in the extraterrestrial air. He felt as thick as the soup and he had to breathe little by little. Even so — he was approaching a sudden need for company. The merchant was warm to the touch. His breath was rough, he was moving in a casual spasm, and he was obviously sleeping. The Explorer was hesitant and decided not to wake him up. He would not serve any real purpose. There would be no rescue, of course. It was the penalty paid for the high profits that could result from unshakeable competition. The merchant who opened a new planet could have a ten-year monopoly of his trade, which he could embrace himself or, more likely, rent to all the comers at a tight price. He followed that the planets were sought in secret and, preferably, away from the usual trade routes."
"A little ruming turned a hypo and there was a plastic container of salt in the kitchen. Back in his search, he cracked for half an hour to expose the corner of the lid and body. The hinges were desperate; he broke them. Hawkins extended the telescopic handle of the peak for the best lever, installed his point in a deep pit, put his fulcrum integrated, and loaded. Five other heels and he was able to see, inside the trunk, what looked like a dusty statue of marble. Ten others and he could see that it was the naked body of Honnest John Barlow, a real estate merchant Evanston, without being corrupted by time. The potter found the apex of the trigeminal nerve with his needle point and gave him 60 cc. In one hour Barlow began to pump."
"Six years ago, at the time of the first peace mapping conference — the Dumbarton oaks — there were 180 million people in the Soviet orbit. Aligning on the anti-totalitarian side there were around 1,625 billion people in the world at that time. Today, only six years later, there are 800 million people under the absolute domination of Soviet Russia — an increase of more than 400 percent. On our side, the figure has decreased to about 500 million. In other words, in less than six years, the odds have changed from 9 to 1 in our favour to 8 to 5 against us. This indicates the rapid pace of communist victories and American defeats in the Cold War."
"The truth is that Europe's needs for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products - mainly from America - are so much more important than its current ability to pay that it must have substantial additional aid or face a very serious economic, social and political deterioration; the remedy is to break the vicious circle and restore the confidence of the European people in the economic future of its own countries and of Europe as a whole; the manufacturer and the farmer in large regions must be able and willing to exchange their products for currencies whose continued value is not in question; in addition to the demoralizing effect on the world in general and the potential for disruption resulting from the desperation of the populations concerned, the consequences for the economy of the United States must be apparent to all; it is logical that the United States should do everything it can to help restore normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace."
"Greece now lacks funds to finance the importation of these goods, which are essential for a simple subsistence, and in these circumstances the Greek people cannot make progress in solving their reconstruction problems. Greece desperately needs financial and economic assistance to be able to resume its purchases of food, clothing, fuel and seeds, which are indispensable for the subsistence of its people and can only be obtained abroad. Greece must have aid in the import of the goods necessary for the restoration of internal order and security, so essential for economic and political recovery. The Greek government has also asked for the help of experienced American administrators, economists and technicians to ensure that financial and other assistance to Greece will be used effectively to create a stable and self-sufficient economy and to improve its public administration. The very existence of the Greek state is now threatened by the terrorist activities of thousands of armed men, who defy the authority of the government at a number of points, including along the northern borders."
"But even in this wild land, the fame of the intertwined children went far, and the wise old women of these parties came to see if the herbs, the songs or one of their dark gifts could be the least useful. They were no more useful than a true doctor who had studied in Belgrade, who practiced in Monastir, and was stimulated to great interest by the accounts of these strange children. The affair challenged all the arts of black or white magic, and the interest of the freaked and dead episode. This is how Nikolai reconciled himself to the inevitable, and as the boys grew up, he crossed in a devouring way and said: ""Thank God, it could have been a thousand times worse!"" They were men of extraordinary beauty. Peter and Ivan called them, Ivan being the boy who held his brother's wrist so irrevocably in his fingers."
"We cannot be content, even if this general standard of living is high, if a part of our people — whether it is a third or a fifth or a tenth — is malnourished, ill-dressed, poorly housed and precarious, and this Republic has begun and developed to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights, including the right to freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of worship, trial by jury, safe from unreasonable searches and seizures."
"The ship had reached the middle of its flight. The bells had sounded, warning each soul to shelter itself, to cling in their couches of pressure against the deadly stress of the acceleration as the ship had reversed itself and started to slow down its dive into Callisto. But the two men had not taken into account. The small steering rockets shone briefly. The men were bruised against the side of the corridor, while the rocket slid lazyly on its axis. The side jets burst once again to stop the spin, when the turn of a quarter of an hour was completed, and the men were beaten against the opposite wall, still without weight, always hanging on each other, still in difficulty."
"It was Rofan who first felt that something was wrong. The novelty was extinguishing, and an elusive thought made him uncomfortable. Something was wrong with the image... what was it? Suddenly he realized. He turned to Thak. ""But – the lights, Mor Thak? Signals – ""Thak's face seemed as old as Mars himself as he was looking at his student. He started talking several times before he could get out of it."" We failed,"" he said, in heavy tones. ""Our signals had to be too weak for the beings of the blue planet to detect them. I had hoped that he would get up and look sadly in the evening sky."
"Campbell had to make some involuntary movements, because a man standing on the edge of the hummock turned his head and saw him. He was tall and thin, and his crest was pure white, a sign of age. He turned and came to Campbell, looking at him with opalescent eyes. The light of the fire laid the dark face of the Earth's man in vivid relief, the lean hard angles, the high-browing nose that had been broken and not straightened, the bitter mouth. Campbell said, in the pure Venusian liquid, ""What is it, Father?"" Kraylen's eyes fell to the chest of the Earth's man. There was black hair on him, and under the hair ran torrid lines, complex silver and deep blue, tattooed with exquisite skill. The white ridge of the old man pointed. Campbell turned and returned on the way. The wind and the liha-trees, the hot blue night beaten with anger and the small man's hatred."
"The descent on Vulcain took another twenty-four hours. Finally, we crossed a cloudy bench and, at about twenty thousand feet, the new world extended dark and dark under us. He certainly looked – to Jan's intense disappointment – completely uninhabited. It was a turbulent, rocky, barren and prohibitive landscape. Under us, there were black ravines and canyons, small jagged peaks and hill arrows, some of them sharp like needle tips. At one of the distant horizons, the earth on several levels, rising, stretched in the foothills of serrated mountain peaks that arose above the line of the black horizon, jagged. A great metal desert here. At the starlight, and the mellow light of little Mercury crescent that clinged on the mountains like a new moon, the metallic quality of the rock was evident — a bronzed metal ore, polished by erosion, so that it resembled a mirror."
"The muscles of Curt Varga's throat tightened as he sent his inaudible questions to his brother in the closed cabin on the other side of the room. ""Is there any suspicions that you are working with me?"" he asked. ""If this is the case, then this arrangement must be broken; I cannot ruin your career too.""The bean-size amplifier so cunningly landed in the living bone of his right temple was slightly vibrating with mocking laughter. ""I think so, Falcon,"" said Val Varga slightly. ""But it doesn't matter; someone has to do the work under cover — and it turns out I can do it with the least suspicion."" The voice softened. ""Careers aren't important anyway. I seem to remember that Dad had a reputation as a biochemist, until the food administrators decided that his work was threatening their dictatorial monopoly."
"It is a grey house on a narrow street. There is a sundial in its courtyard, by which the House Council can say the hours of the day and when to ring the bell. When the bell rings, we all get up from our beds. The sky is green and cold in our windows to the east. The shade on the sundial marks half an hour while we dress and eat our breakfast in the dining room, where there are five long tables with twenty plates of clay and twenty cups of clay on each table. Then we will work in the streets of the city, with our brooms and rakes. In five hours, when the sun is high, we return home and eat our lunch, for which half an hour is allowed."
"First of all, let me talk for a moment about this fall and the coming winter. We have the possibility, in the case of families who need a real livelihood, to put them on the dole or put them to work. They do not want to go on the dole, and they are just a thousand percent. So we agree that we have to put them to work for a decent wage, and when we reach this decision, we kill two birds with a stone, because these families will earn enough by working not only to survive themselves, but to buy food for their stock, and seeds for next year's planting."
"I know that many people are worried about state banks that are not members of the federal reserve system. There is no opportunity for this. These banks can and will receive assistance from member banks and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. And, of course, they are under the immediate control of state banking authorities. These state banks follow the same course as national banks, except that they get their licences to resume their activities with state authorities, and these authorities have been invited by the Treasury Secretary to allow their good banks to open up on the same schedule as national banks."
"The recognition of the falseness of material wealth as a norm of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that the public service and the high political position must be valued only by the norms of pride of place and personal profit, and there must be an end to conduct in banks and in business which too often gave sacred confidence the likeness of a bad callous and selfish conduct. Little wonder that trust languishes, because it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sanctity of obligations, on faithful protection, on selfless execution; without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not only for changes of ethics. This nation demands action, and action now. Our greatest main task is to put people to work."
"The stockings hung at the fireplace, and the big tree stood in the living room. The children slept, and the father and mother went up to bed. In the wall of the cellar, the little mice were all awake. ""Ee-ee-ee!"" shouted Squeaky; ""why can't we crawl in the big room and see the great Christmas tree? The children talked about it for days, and we never saw one. Mother, please, let's go and see it."" ""Yes,"" said Sniffy, let's go. Everything smells so good. The children and the cook made long strings of popcorn today. I found a little on the floor of the cellar, and I want more."" ""I searched our hole,"" said Sharpyeyes, ""and I saw cake and candy ready for the children. Oh, I want a bite of these good things! Please let us have a Christmas party."""
"The horror of the Dunwiches came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and Dr. Armitage was among those who attended his monstrous prologue. During that time, he had heard of the grotesque journey from Whatley to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. These efforts had been futile, since Armitage had issued warnings of the highest intensity to all librarians with the burden of the feared volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, but almost as anxious to return home, as if he feared the results of being far away. At the beginning of August, the semi-final developed, and in the small hours of the third Dr. Armitage was suddenly awakened by the savage and fierce cries of the wild dog on the college campus."
"It was five and a half hours later, when we arrived in Yardly Chase and followed the worthy butler to the old covered hall with his log fire. A nice picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the proud dark head of the mother bent on the two righteous. Lord Yardly stood by them, smiling at them. ""Mr. Poirot and Captain Hastings,"" said the butler. Lady Yardly looked at a beginning, her husband came forward uncertain, her eyes asking for instruction to Poirot. The little man was equal on occasion. ""All my apologies! It's that I'm still studying Miss Marvell's case. She's coming to you Friday, isn't she? I'm making a little tour first to make sure that everything is safe."
"My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England's greatest living authorities over primitive man. He was really a genius — everyone admits him. His mind lived in Paleolithic times, and the disadvantage of life for him was that his body lived in the modern world. Papa did not take care of modern man — even the neolithic man whom he despised as a mere shepherd of cattle, and he did not get excited until he reached the Musterian era. Unfortunately, we cannot entirely do without modern men. We are forced to have a kind of truck with butchers and bakers and dairy and farmers."
"The sky also has its changes, but they are less marked than those of the vegetation and the river. Clouds sometimes plant it, but it is normally a dome of mixed hues, and the main blue hue. At daytime, the blue will pale in white where it touches the white of the earth, after sunset it has a new circumference – orange, melting upwards in soft purple. But the core of the blue persists, and so it is by night. Then the stars will hang like lamps of the immense vault. The distance between the vault and them is nothing like the distance behind them, and this distance more distant, though beyond the color, has freed itself from the blue. The sky sets not only the climates and the seasons, but when the earth will be beautiful. It can do little – only the effusion of flowers. But when the sky chooses, glory may rain in the bazaars of Chandrapore or a blessing passes from horizon to horizon."
"We were in the street. The avenue was crowded. On the days when the weather was so beautiful, the personal hour of the afternoon is usually the hour of the extra walk. As always, the great musical tower played with all its pipes, the March of the United States. The Numbers, hundreds, thousands of Numbers in one light blue (probably a derivative of the old uniform) with gold insignia on the chest, — the state number of each, male or female, — the Numbers were walking slowly, four abrastes, keeping the stage exalted. I, the four of us, was only one of the countless waves of a powerful torrent. To my left, O-90 (if one of my ancestors with long hair wrote this a thousand years ago, he would probably call it by this funny word, mine), to my right, two Unknown Numbers, a number and a number."
"Violet passed the hay to her brother and crawled into herself. Then Jess gave Benny up like a bunch of groceries and, taking a last look at the angry sky and waving trees, she climbed up after him. The two children managed to roll the door back so that the crack was completely closed before the storm bursts. But at that moment, she broke with revenge. It seemed to the children that the sky would split, so sharp were the cracks of thunder. But not a drop of rain reached them in their spacious retreat. They could see nothing at all, because the transport car was closely made, and all on the outside was almost as black as at night. Through all this, Benny slept. Currently the thunder fainted, and fainted in the valley, and the rain flowed. Only the drop of the trees on the top of the car could be heard."
"It was the northwestern coast of Australia, the coast of this almost unexplored region, which is one of the few remote territories in the world that still preserves its fabulous romance atmosphere. It was on the shores of a large shallow bay where a small river suddenly opened its land arms to welcome the tropical ocean. The fleshy vegetation, burned by the sun, developed densely to the edge of the water, keeping the suffocating atmosphere in its great bosom. Yet, only this mericorious shadow made life lasting to the sensitive human beings. The sun was at its zenith, a furious disc of melted heat in a bronze sky. The sea at the mouth of the river was flat under its burning rays, with the exception of the wave where a great underwater creature disturbed its surface."
"Sir Reuben Levy's cook, with his eye on Mr. Bunter's gentlemanly and well-adapted appearance, hastened to produce what was needed. His visitor put on the table a basket, containing a bottle of water, a silver-backed hairbrush, a pair of boots, a small roll of linoleum, and the ""Letters of a self-made merchandler to his Son"", bound in a polished morocco. He pulled an umbrella from under his arm and added it to the collection. He then advanced a majestic photographic machine and installed it in the neighborhood of the kitchen range; then, extending a newspaper on the surface of the table, he began to roll his sleeves and insinuate himself in a pair of surgical gloves. Sir Reuben Levy's valet, entering at the moment and finding him so engaged, put aside the kitchen servant, who fixed herself at the front, and critically inspected the apparatus."
"The two horses took their way down carefully on the loose shale of the steep hillside. The tall stallion of the bay in the ridiculed lead, throwing his head nervously, and flaking his rider's flannel shirt with moss. Behind the stallion a young girl mounted a lighter colored bay, whose method of descent, far less visible, was safer, because he came more slowly, and in the very bad places he ripped his four feet forward and slides, sometimes almost sitting on the ground. At the base of the hill there was a narrow strip of level; then a wash of eight feet, with steep banks, barred the way to the opposite side of the cañon, which rose gently towards the hills beyond. At the foot of the descent, the man came back and waited until the girl was safe; then he rolled his mountain and dragged to the washing. Twenty feet of the horse gave him his head and a word."
"""Hello, sir,"" said Jeeves. ""He put the good old cup of tea gently on the table near my bed, and I took a refreshing sip. Just fine, as usual. Not too hot, not too soft, not too weak, not too strong, not too much milk, and not a drop spilled into the saucer. A very incredible crack, Jeeves. So wildly competent in all respects. I have already said it, and I will repeat it. I mean, just take a small instance. Every other valet I have ever used to peach in my room in the morning while I was still sleeping, causing a lot of misery: but Jeeves seems to know when I am awakened by a kind of telepathy. He always floats with the cup exactly two minutes after my arrival to life."
"I dropped the little squat red book on my knee and looked at it out of the narrow, oblong, bloody window. We were turning the east coast of cliffs, to the very edge of which a plough, stumbling behind its two great horses, was driving the last of its dark furrows. In a distant cleavage between the rocks, a cold and idle sea was sitting without noise its moss frigid garlands. I looked at the flat expanse of the waters, then I turned my head, and looked with a sort of suddenness in the face of my only travel companion. He had entered the car, except without being listened to, but not totally disenchanted, at the last country station. His characteristics were a little obscure in the outpouring of light that hung between our four narrow walls, but apparently his eyes had been fixed on my face for a little while."
"He is about fourteen years old, but tall for this age, with the elegance of the shape and manhood of the bearing. His naked neck and limbs are well developed by a healthy exercise; his characteristics show an open and warm heart, while his high forehead, around which his brown hair naturally clings, radiates with a brilliant intelligence. He wears the usual garment of youth, the short toga reaching under the knee, and a hollow spheroid of gold hanging around his neck. A pack of papers and rolls of vellum tied together, and worn by an old servant behind him, shows us that he returns from school."
"Such agitation ensued so that you thought of a goose that was the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a question of course - and indeed it was something very similar in this house. Mrs. Crachit warmed the whistling sauce; Master Pierre massaged the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened the apple sauce; Martha put the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim next to him in a small corner at the table; the two young Crachits set up chairs for everyone, without forgetting, and, putting up guards on their posts, piled with spoons in their mouths, for fear that they would get bogged down in the chest before they came to their help. Finally, the dishes were put on, and the grace was said."
"Once upon a time the forest was in a great concussion. At the beginning of the evening, the wise old Cedars had shaken their heads and told strange things that had to happen. They had lived in the forest a lot, many years; but they had never seen sights as wonderful as they had to be seen now in the sky, and on the hills, and in the distant village. ""Can tell us what you see,"" pleaded a little Wine. ""We who are not so great as you can see none of these wonderful things."" ""All the sky seems to be inflamed,"" said one of the Cedars, ""and the stars seem to dance among the clouds; the angels descend from heaven to the earth and speak with the shepherds on the hills."" The vine trembled with excitement. His closest neighbour was a small tree, so small that he was hardly ever noticed; but it was a very beautiful little tree, and the Wines, Ferns and Mosses loved him very much."
"Anthony, walking along the forty-second street one afternoon under a grey sky of steel, unexpectedly ran into Richard Caramel emerging from the barber shop of the Manhattan hotel. It was a cold day, the first day definitely cold, and Caramel had on one of those coats on his knees, lined with sheep, long worn by the workers of the Middle West, who had just been approved in fashion. His soft hat was a discreet dark brown, and from under his light eye was blazing like a topaz. He stopped with enthusiasm Anthony, slapping him on the arms of a desire to stand warm rather than to play, and, after his inevitable hand shaking, exploded to the sound. ""Come like the devil—Good God, I was working like the deuce all day until my room was so cold, I thought I would have pneumonia. Darn Landlady saving on the coal came when I screamed for her for half an hour on the stairs."
"If, then, we represent our earth as a small ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a great globe nine feet across and 323 meters away, which is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes walk. The moon would be a little pea two and a half feet from the world. Between the earth and the sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty meters from the sun. All around and around these bodies there would be empty until you arrived at Mars, one hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth; Jupiter near a thousand, one foot in diameter; Saturn, a little smaller, two miles wide; Uranus four miles wide and Neptune six miles wide."
"The other day, while I was walking in a side street in one of our big cities, I heard these words sounding from a room so full of people that I could only see the face of the auctioneer and the hammer raised above the heads of the crowd. ""Go! go! go! go! descend the hammer with a sharp rap. I don't know how or why it was, but the words struck me with a new strength and meaning. I had heard them hundreds of times, with only a sense of fun. This time, they sounded solemn. ""Go! go! go! go! go!"" ""That's how it is with life, I thought - ""in time."" This world is a kind of auction room; we don't know that we are buyers: we are, in fact, more like beggars; we didn't bring money to exchange precious minutes, hours, days, or years; they are given to us."
"The accuser consciousness, the life that knows that it has ignored the rights of others, is the ally of fear. Well, what about the mysterious future? What is its vision? False prophets always prophesy peace, and the reason why their prophecy is false is that there is never peace in the way they want it. So, if this page were to start on the note of ""Peace, Peace"", you could both fake it. As long as there is life there is change. Peace of stagnation is an attribute of death. So it is an element that we can expect in the future — the element of change. Whatever we may regret, the old world as we knew it can never return."
"A squire of horse claws with brilliant boots. Sweet day, Mr. John! Sweet day, your honor!... Day!... Day!... Two high boots jogging on Dublin. Lal le ral le raddy. ""That reminds me, Mr. Deasy said. You can do me a favor, Mr. Dedalus, with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press. Sit down for a moment. I just have to copy the end. He went to the office near the window, shot in his chair twice and read a few words of the sheet on the drum of his typewriter. ""Sit down. I'm sorry, he said on his shoulder, the diktats of common sense. Just for a moment. He looked from under his eyebrows tight to the manuscript by his elbow and, whispering, began to profuse the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing the drum to erase a mistake."
"My own theme is Courage, as you should use it in the great fight that seems to me to come between young people and their best; by young people, that is, of course, you and by your best us. I want you to take this position: that young people have left in our hands decisions in national affairs that are more vital to them than to us. Things about the next war, for example, and why the last never had a beginning. I use the word combat because it must, I think, start with a challenge; but the goal is the opposite of antagonism, it is partnership. I want you to maintain that the time has come for young people to demand this partnership, and to demand it courageously. That's why you came to St. Andrews. With some alarums and excursions in college life."
"So, saying, Tom threw himself at the door of the house, and his wife thought he was going back to his work as usual; but she was wrong. He was walking to the wood, and there, when he came to the edge of a small stream, he sat down and began to brood on his grievances. ""Now, I'm going to tell you what,"" Tom said to himself, ""it's much more pleasant sitting here in the shade than grilling on celery trenches, and clearing the fruit of the wall, with a cooking sun on his back, and a warm wall in front of his eyes. ""But I'm a miserable worker. I have to either work or see my family starvation die; a very hard lot is to be a worker."" ""Ah,"" said a voice near him. ""Tom began, and to his great surprise, saw a little man on the size of his own baby, sitting in composition at his elbow! He was dressed in a green hat, a green coat and green shoes."
"Then the boy wandered into the forest until he came to the edge of a small tablecloth of water. It was too small to be called a lake; but it was deep and clear and was covered with large trees. It was at night, and the sun was falling down. The boy always stood by the water and thought of how beautiful it was to see the sun, red and glorious, between the black trunks of the pine forests. Then he looked at the great blue sky and thought how beautiful it was to see the small clouds folding over one another like a pink-colored belt of the waves. Then he looked at the lake and saw the clouds and the sky and the trees reflected there, down among the lilies. And he wanted to be a painter, for he said to himself, ""I am sure that there are no trees in the world with such beautiful leaves as these pines. I am sure that there are no clouds in the world that are so beautiful as these. I know that it is so much of the world, and I know that it is so much of the world."""
"He had not seen anything of her from the beginning. A bad deal! He had not the idea of giving him much money to allow a man that he knew nothing about living in idleness. He had seen this kind of thing before; no good ever came from it. Worse, he had no hope of shaking his resolution; she was as stubborn as a mule, had always been of a child. He did not see where it should end. They had to cut their coat according to their fabric. He would not leave room until he saw the young Bosinney with a clean income."
"It was about the winter, and the very cold weather, when one day the two older brothers of Gluck had gone out, with their usual warning to little Gluck, who was left in mind the roast, that he would not let anyone in and give anything. Gluck sat down near the fire, for it was raining very loud. He turned and turned, and the roast became pleasant and brown. ""What pity,"" thought Gluck, ""that my brothers never ask anyone to dine. I am sure, when they have such a beautiful piece of sheep that it would do their hearts good to have someone to eat it with them."" Just as he was speaking, there came a double blow at the door of the house, but heavy and dull, as if the striker had been tied. ""It must be the wind,"" said Gluck; ""no one else would venture to knock twice at our door."" No; it was not the wind."
"Johnny recommenced the Flying Machine and directed it to the Moon. And as they were turning around the side of the Moon the part that looked like the face of a twisted man until it disappeared. ""I can't say whether we are approaching the Moon or not!"" cried Johnny with anxiety. Currently, however, they saw the face of the man in the Moon coming on the other side. ""We had to make a complete circuit of the Moon,"" Janey decided. ""See, Johnny, the rudder is pulled on one side! That's the reason!"" Johnny pulled the rope from the rudder until the Flying Machine was directed towards the Moon, and they approached him at great speed. ""Arise, Johnny!"" exclaimed Janey, when they were able to make all mountain peaks and valleys very distinctly."
"But Meg couldn't go and supervise the men. She had washed her hair before breakfast, and she sat down drinking her coffee in a green turban, with a dark damp loop stamped on each cheek. José, the butterfly, always came down in a silk skirt and a kimono jacket. ""You'll have to go, Laura; you're the artist."" Away Laura stole, still holding her piece of bread and butter. It's so delicious to have an excuse to eat through the doors, and besides, she liked to have to arrange things; she always felt that she could do it so much better than anyone. Four men in their shirts were standing together on the way to the garden. They were wearing sticks covered with rolls of canvas, and they had large bags of tools plunging on their backs. They looked impressive. Laura now wanted that she didn't have the bread and butter, but there was nowhere to put it, and she couldn't throw it away."
"But he didn't draw the attention of old Woodifield to the picture above a boy's table in uniform looking at a grave standing in one of those spectral photographers' parks with the storm clouds of the photographers behind him. It wasn't new. He had been there for more than six years. ""There was something I wanted to tell you,"" said old Woodifield, and his eyes became dark. ""What was it? I had it in my mind when I started to come out this morning."" His hands started to tremble, and red spots showed up over his beard. Poor old guy, he's on his last pins, thought the boss."
"When I went down a very steep street, where the road was covered with ice, I saw an old woman, slowly and timidly taking her way. It was one of the poor but respectable old ladies who dress in rusty black, wear old hats shaped, and carry large bags. Some young people mock these archaic figures; but those who are better raised treat them with respect. They find something touching in the faded costumes, the disgusted faces, and the knowledge that these old ladies alone have lost their youth, friends, and often the fortune, and patiently wait to be called to a world that seems to have passed and forgotten. Well, as I slipped and flogged along, I looked at the little black cap in front, waiting every minute for him to come down, and trying to hurry, that I could offer my help."
"Above the earth, above the earth and the sea, the seed floated, carried on the strong arms of the autumn wind. ""Behold, you will lie down, little seed,"" he said, ""and put it on the ground, and put a leaf upon it. He flew away immediately, because he had much to watch. It was in the dark night, and the seed could not see where it was placed, and the leaf covered it. Something heavy came now, and pressed so hard that the seed came near to be destroyed; but the leaf, weak, protected it. It was a human foot that walked along the ground, and pressed the seed cut down into the earth. When the foot was removed, the earth fell, and filled the little pit that it had made. The cold came, and the snow fell at several feet deep; but the seed spread there quietly, waiting for the heat and light."
"Daffy-down-dilly was thus called because in his nature he looked like a flower and liked to do only what was beautiful and pleasant, and took no pleasure in working of any kind. But, while Daffy-down-dilly was still a little boy, his mother sent him away from his pleasant house, and put him in the custody of a very strict schoolmaster, who went under the name of Mr. Toil. Those who knew him best, said that this Mr. Toil was a very worthy character, and that he had done more good, both to children and to adult people, than anyone in the world. Nevertheless, Mr. Toil had a serious face; his voice, too, was hard; and all his ways seemed very unpleasant to our friend Daffy-down-dilly."
"We know that sin means a state of mind or emotion, a false conception of moral values, and that virtue is not guaranteed by a legal sanction. We frankly recognize the weakness of man and the complexity of social life; that is why the dangers and temptations of evil must be confronted and understood. Finally, we believe that knowledge brings strength; and, therefore, these ""difficult"" questions cannot and must not be ignored in conversation or in books: above all, not by those who, intentionally or not, influence the thought by their power to create character in fiction. This awakening to a new vision of Truth, however, has produced an atmosphere in modern novels that, whatever the purpose or intention of modern novelists, leads to a serious evil."
"The coffee first appeared in the official records of the colony of New England in 1670. In 1683, the year after William Penn's establishment on the Delaware, we found him buying coffee supplies in the New York market and paying them at the rate of eighteen shillings and nine pence per pound. The coffee houses following the English and continental prototypes were soon established in all the colonies. Those of New York and Philadelphia are described in separate chapters. The Boston houses are described at the end of this chapter. Norfolk, Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans also had them. Conrad Leonhard's coffee house at 320 Market Street. St. Louis, was famous for its coffee and coffee cake, from 1844 to 1905, when it became a bakery and lunch room, removing in 1919 at Eight and Pine Streets. In the early days of the Great West, coffee and tea were difficult to obtain; and instead, teas were often made from grasses, other hardwood roots, and roses of hardwood."
"The hypothesis of mental continuity throughout the organic evolution can be used in two different ways. On the one hand, we can consider that we have more knowledge of our own minds than those of animals, and that we should use this knowledge to deduce the existence of something similar to our own mental processes in animals and even in plants. On the other hand, we can consider that animals and plants have simpler phenomena, more easily analyzed than those of the human mind; on this ground, we can insist that the explanations that are appropriate in the case of animals are not slightly rejected in the case of man."
"At the beginning of the 17th century, a ship was built in New Amsterdam, and in the middle of this century shipyards were scattered along the coast of New England at Newburyport, Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London and New Haven. Shipyards were built in Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York for the trade of this colony with England and India. Wilmington and Philadelphia soon entered the race and passed New York, although they could not match the pace set by New England."
"The clouds that visit his sky reveal themselves beyond a great ascent, and the veil, white and huge, to the other, and flow beyond the other. But the plains over which they traveled and the Weald to which they go, the people of the valley do not see and remember much. The wind, when it reaches such fields, is no longer a storm of salt, but fruitful and sweet, an inner breeze; and those whose blood has been fed here feel in this wind the fruitfulness of our orchards and all the life that all things draw from the air. In this place, when I was a boy, I pushed through a fringe of bees that made a complete screen between me and the world, and I came to a clearing called ""No Man's Land""."
"The term ""unconscious"", now so familiar to all readers of modern works in psychology, offends some adherents of the past. However, there should be no particular mystery about this. It is not a new animist abstraction, but simply a collective word to include all the physiological changes that escape our remark, all the forgotten experiences and impressions of the past that continue to influence our desires, reflections and conduct, even if we cannot remember it. What we can remember at any time is indeed an infinite part of what has happened to us. We could not remember anything unless we almost forget everything. As Bergson says, the brain is the organ of forgetfulness as well as of memory."
"We had travelled seventeen miles on the day of the December storm, the third of a four-day journey. The snow was stacked high on our packs, our rifles were crumbled with ice, the leather of our boots nailed to the plate was frozen stiff on our lacquered feet. The tired lieutenant led us to the door of a small house in a side street.""12 next men,"" he said. ""A dozen of us fell from the ranks and dragged us over the threshold. We dragged snow and mud over a stone floor without stain. Before an open fire stood Madame and the three children — an eight-year-old girl, a five-year-old boy, a three-year-old boy."
"There he was! And nervously, he tied a bow in front of the mirror, shoved his hair on both hands, pulled the flaps out of his jacket pockets. He made between £500 and £600 a year in a fruit farm — from all places — Rhodesia. No capital. No penny came to him. No chance of seeing his incomes rise for at least four years. As for the looks and all that, he was completely out of the race. He could not even boast of being healthy, because East Africa's affairs had hit him so deeply that he had to take six months off. He was still a little pale — worse than usual this afternoon, he thought, leaning forward and looking in the mirror. Good heavens! What had happened? His hair was almost green. Dash everything, he had no green hair at all. It was a little too stiff. And then the green light trembled in the glass; it was the shadow of the tree outside."
"Frozen mountains, in summer, birds and winds must bear the seed of alpine flowers – lilies that leaned on unmelted snows, poppies, coloured herbs, and palpable and fragrant beauties that change their name with countries. How fair and reasonable it would seem that the flowers that border the ice in July should agree to bloom in the lowlands without colder in February! The competition of blue, magenta and scarlet on the upper slopes austeres of the Rocky Mountains, where the nights are bitter to summer vagabonds – why shouldn't it bloom at the bezel of a valley barn in the months when the cicles cling to the awnings in this dome? But no. Mountain storms are enduring to the silky-petald."
"The main subjects on which President Wilson and I disagreed were as follows: his presence in Paris during the peace negotiations and, above all, his presence as a delegate to the Peace Conference; the fundamental principles of the constitution and functions of a League of Nations as proposed or advocated by him; the form of the organic act, known as ""Couvant"", its elaborate character and its inclusion in the treaty restoring a state of peace; the treaty of defensive alliance with France; the need for a defined programme that the American commissioners could follow in the continuation of negotiations; the use of private interviews and confidential agreements to arrive at settlements, a practice that has given colour to the burden of ""secret diplomacy""; and, finally, the admission of Japanese claims to the possession of German treaty rights in Kiao-Chau and in the province of Shantung."
"The director of one of the large power stations on the banks of the river above the falls told me that the centre of the river bed at Canadian Falls is deep and of a form of saucer. Thus, it may be possible to fill this up to a uniform depth, and to divert a lot of water for power plants. And that, he said, would provide the need for more power, which will certainly arise soon, without removing from the beauty of Niagara. This is a beautiful concession of utilities to ordinary spectators. Yet, I doubt that we are satisfied. The true secret of the beauty and terror of falls is not their height or width, but the sense of colossal power and unintelligible disaster caused by the dive of this vast body of water. If this was removed, there would be little visible change, but the heart would have left. American Falls do not inspire this feeling the same way as Canadians. It is because they are less in volume, and because the water does not fall so much into one place."
"Oh, so sad as it is, this neighborhood! By day, the streets are a depression, with their fawns and their steam baths. Gray and sick is the light. Gray and sick, too, are hunting shops, and gray and sick are the people and children. Everything has followed the grass and the flowers. Childhood has no place; so, above the roofs, you can see the amazing points of a board school. Such games as it happens are played but without a list, and every little face is stunned. Glove warehouses barely support their lobby heads, and the stockings, beet houses and gables of the alleys seem to always brood the bitter nights of adventure."
"We go under a bow behind a theater and next to the Opera door. The cabins are quickly filled with products. Gentlemen in long coats of alpaca and carrying wonderful marble notebooks walk with a great air. A chain of mountain pumpkins rises behind a hill of cabbages. Onion feasts are hung on the rails. The barrel heads are swallowed, revealing purple grapes buried in cork dust. Pears and figs, cultivated under the glass for rich patterns, are deposited in soft boxes lined with fabrics. A broken box of mandarin oranges has poured its contents into a splash of ruddy gold on the track of the board. A wagon is driven in, a heavy load of beets, and the wide wheels crash through the sweet fruits so that the air is heavy with the acrid softness. We take our way between the cabins and stalls until we find the flowers."
"The balm bed is made of small twigs of balm trees. If you would well rest, do not save on the amount that you gather; a lot of time I had my bones badly as a result of being too tired to make my bed properly and try to sleep on a thin layer of branches. If you try to cut the balm branches, they will miss your effort by coming out and slapping into the face. You can cut them with your knife, but it is the slow work and will bellow your hands. Take the twig per twig with the thumb and fingers (the thumb on top, pointing towards the tip of the branch, and the two indexes below); press with the thumb, and with a twist of the wrist you can grab the branches like pipe rods."
"She raised her little black eyebrows. ""Is New York a labyrinth? I thought it was so straight, like Fifth Avenue. And with all the streets of the cross counted!"" She seemed to guess her weak disapproval of it, and added, with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face: ""If you knew how I just love her, the high-right, and the great honest labels on everything!"" He saw her chance. ""Everything can be labelled – but not everyone is."" ""Maybe I'll simplify too much – but you'll warn me if I do it."" She turned away from the fire to look at him. ""There were only two people here who made me feel as if they understood what I wanted to say and could explain things to me: you and Mr. Beaufort."" Archer won at the junction of names, and then, with a quick adjustment, understood, sympathized and pitiful. If close to the powers of evil, she had to live more freely in their air."
"Thursday, therefore, he was walking thoughtfully along the slippery sidewalks, scattered with shovels, and came in view of Myra's house, at half an hour after five hours, a delay that he would have liked of his mother. He was waiting on the doorstep with his eyes nonchalently at half-closed, and planned his entrance with precision. He would cross the ground, not too hastyly, to Mrs. St. Claire, and said with the right modulation: ""Dear Mrs. St. Claire, I am terribly sorry to be late, but my handmaid"" — he stopped there and realized that he was quoting — but my uncle and I had to see a man — Yes, I met your enchanted daughter at the dance school. Then he shook his hand, using this little arch half-foreigner, with all the little women who were women, and he shouted at the men who stood up, paralyzed in rigid groups for mutual protection."
"In 19 years Agatha had noticed the invariable interest of a businessman in the local telegraph service, and the tendency of lovers to be dissatisfied with the neighbourhood's mail services. Burton Forbes' concern about the learning that rural free delivery called to Oak Knoll but once a day certainly ranked him, according to Agatha. ""You can always send Howard to the village for the afternoon mail,"" she suggested, the new warmth in her voice an unconscious demonstration of the truth that everyone loves a lover. ""Thank you, it's good!"" The illumination of Forbes' face completely counterbalances her immediate conscientious warning that she should not spoil him simply because she was sorry for him."
"All these animals returned and told their brothers and friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big garden that was really a doctor. And every time a creature fell ill, not only horses and cows and dogs, but all the little things in the fields, like the miches of harvest and water flies, badgers and bats, they immediately arrived at his house at the edge of the city, so that his large garden was almost always filled with animals trying to see him. There were so many things that he had to have special doors made for the different kinds. He wrote ""HORSES"" through the front door, ""COWS"" through the side door, and ""SHEP"" on the kitchen door. Each kind of animal had a separate door – even the mice had a small tunnel made for them in the cellar, where they patiently waited in rows for the doctor to come and see them."
"The old creature who was dumped, wearing a green satin dress, a black velvet coat and a white hat with purple feathers, was slowly jerking off on the steps as if he were standing on threads. She looked at her, laughed, yelled and knuckled; her claws clung around what looked like a bag of dirty boots. But just then, there was still Mrs Raddick with – she – and another lady who was hovering in the background. Mrs Raddick rushed at me. She was brilliantly puffed, gay, a different creature. She was like a woman who said ""good-bye"" to her friends on the platform of the station, with no minute to spare before the train started. ""Oh, you're here, always. Isn't that lucky! You didn't leave."
"There were a number of people out there this afternoon, much more than last Sunday. And the band sounded louder and more gay. It was because the Season had begun. Because although the band played all year long on Sundays, out of season it was never the same. It was like someone playing with only the family to listen; it didn't matter how he played if there were no strangers present. Was it not the leader wearing a new coat, too? She was sure that it was new. He gratified with his foot and beat his arms like a cock about to sing, and the group men sitting in the green rotunda blew their cheeks and dazzled with music. Now there was a small piece of ""flutey"" — very pretty! — a small chain of brilliant drops. She was sure that he would be repeated; she raised her head and smiled."
"The improved determination by Kepler of the terrestrial orbit was obtained by tracing the different positions of the earth corresponding to the successive rotations of Mars, that is, the intervals of 687 days. At each of these intervals, the date of the year would give the angle MSE (Mars-Sun-Earth), and the observation of Tycho the angle MES. Thus the triangle could be solved except for the scale, and the ratio of SE to SM would give the distance of Mars from the sun in terms of that of the earth. Measuring from a fixed position of Mars (e.g. perihelion), this gave the variation of SE, showing the inequality of the earth. Measuring from a fixed position of the earth, it would likewise give a series of positions of Mars, which, although not far from the circle whose diameter was the axis of the orbit of Mars, joining perihelion and aphelion, always fell within the circle except at these two points."
"Now you have to draw the rest of the head, and it is rather a bet. Personally, I go in for strong heads. I fear that it is not a strong neck; I expect it to be an author, and it is not well fed. But it is the worst of the strong heads; they make it so difficult to join the chin and the back of the neck. The next thing to do is to put in the ear; and once you've done this is easy. The ears are much harder than the eyes. I hope it's fair. It seems to me to be a little too far south. But it's done now. And once you've put in the ear you can't come back; not unless you're on a very good committee that provides rubber India as well as pencils. Now I'm doing the hair."
"She had no powder, but she found in her grandfather's room a mass of magnesia, which he used to take for heartburn, and passed it over her face and brown hands. Then a persistent look in her little mirror finally gave her joy; she wanted to see herself so charming that she could see herself so. The admiration came, and she thought that she was more attractive to look at than she had ever been in her life, and that, perhaps, at last, she could start to be sought out for like other girls. The little glass showed a kind of beauty in her thin and immature young face; trembling dance airs ran through her head, her feet keeping the time — ah, she hoped so often that night! Perhaps — maybe — she would be asked all the numbers."
"After a long and arduous devotion to the study of physics and astronomy, I, Hans Pfaal of Rotterdam, decided for a long time to build a balloon of my own original line and to try a flight in it. As a result, I had made a huge bag of cambrique muslin, varnished with rubber for the protection against time. I bought all the instruments necessary for a prolonged ascent and finally prepared for the inflation of the balloon. Here poses my secret, my invention, the thing in which my balloon differed from all the balloons that had been before. On a particular metallic substance and a very common acid, I was able to make a gas of a density of about 37.4 less than that of hydrogen, and therefore by far the lightest substance ever known. It would be used to transport the balloon to heights larger than before, because hydrogen is the gas usually used."
"Jupiter, two hours high, was the herald of the day; the Pleiades, just above the horizon, poured out their sweet influence to the east; Lyra split by the zenith; Andromeda veiled his glories newly discovered from the naked eye to the south; the regular Pointers, far below the pole, looked gently upwards from the depths of the north to their sovereign. This was the glorious spectacle that I entered the train. As we passed through, the timid approach of the twilight became more perceptible; the intense blue of the sky began to soften; the small stars, like the little ones, rested first; the sister beams of the Pleiades soon melted together; but the brilliant constellations of the west and the north remained unchanged."
"Her charm is indescribable. She's pretty, she's well dressed, but it's not that. It's a sincerity in a way, a complete hospitality; at the same time you're accepted as a friend of the family, it's Suzanne's charm. After a few questions about where I came from, how long I was there, and where I was going, Suzanne led me upstairs to be introduced to ""My beautiful only"", an old lady with white hair sitting on a large right chair. Then, after having been extended to me, Suzanne preceded me to the garden and left me alone while she had entered to see that dinner was exceptionally good. A soft foot on the gravel promenade sounded behind me, and I turned to see one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen."
"Connart had begun in life with a thin, open, believing disposition, and with this disposition for his main asset, he had entered the world of business. At thirty years he had almost lost everything, but his heart, but he was stolen from him, also by a Mary Bateman of Boston, a quiet little woman, with common sense, a few thousand dollars and a taste for travel. It was this taste, combined with a slight weakness of the lungs, which led Connart to go into the Pacific trade, also a legacy, an English relationship, of some two thousand strange pounds, which allowed him to make the new start in business without calling his wife's capital. Dobree of San Francisco gave him the ground. Connart had the qualities of his faults. The men stole it, but they loved it. The men are more than. Dobree, in business, was indeed a very difficult person, without any more fine feeling, and never gave him a centime or a chance. The men stole it, but they loved it. The men are more than. Dobree, in fact, was a very difficult person, without any more fine feeling, and never gave him the qualities of a centime or a chance, but a head, but a head, and a stroke, and gave him a head of the head of a stroke, and a head of a stroke, and a head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head of the"
"And I want beauty in my life. I have seen beauty in a sunset and in the spring woods and in the eyes of various women, but now these happy accidents of light and color no longer make me shiver. And I want beauty in my life itself, rather than in chances as it happens. It seems to me that many of the actions of my life were beautiful, very long ago, when I was young in a faint world of friendly girls, who were all more beautiful than any girl is today. For women now are simply more or less beautiful, and as I know, their looks when at their best have been meticulously improved and edited."
"I had stayed a few steps behind, when I saw Captain Nemo rushing to me. With his strong hand, he bends me on the ground, while his companion did the same to Conseil. At first, I didn't know what to think of this sudden attack, but I was quickly reassured when I saw the captain lie next to me and remain motionless. I was lying on the ground, just under cover of a bush of seaweeds, when, rising my head, I saw a huge mass, breaking phosphorescent glows, passing blusteringly by. My blood frozen in my veins as I recognized two formidable sharks. They were men's eaters, terrible creatures with huge tails and dazzling eyes, monstrous brutes who could crush an entire man in their iron jaws!"
"Outside the rainbow valley, the wind could be rolling and blowing. Here, it always went slowly. Small fairy paths, sinuous, run here and there on roots of spruces cushioned with moss. Wild cherry trees, which in time of flowering would be misty white, were scattered throughout the valley, mixing themselves with dark spruce. A small stream with amber waters crossed the village of Glen. The houses of the village were comfortably distant; only at the upper end of the valley was a small deserted cottage, called ""the old Bailey house."" It had not been occupied for many years, but a grass-grown dam surrounded it and inside was an old garden where the children of Ingleside could find violets and marguerites and lilies still blooming in season."
"When we were sitting by the fire for an hour, the old men and the warriors came to visit us, and the smoke began. The women laid carpets in a large half circle, and each man took his seat with a perfect reproduction: that is, in absolute silence and with a face like a stone. The painting of peace was on them all—red, or red and white—and they sat down and looked at the ground until I had made the welcome speech. Soon the air was dense with perfumed smoke; in the thick blue haze the scanning of the painted figures had the appearance of a fantastic dream. An old man rose up and made a long and touching speech, with much reference to the calumets and the buried hatchets."
"One afternoon, at sunset, a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their house, speaking of the Great Face of Peter. They only had to raise their eyes, and there it was obvious that the sun lit up all its characteristics. And what was the Great Face of Peter? Peter's Great Face was a work of Nature in his majestic mood, formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by immense rocks, which had been thrown together in such a position that, seen at a distance, precisely to resemble the characteristics of the human face. It seemed that a huge giant, or a Titan, had carved his own resemblance on the precipice. There was the wide bow of the forehead, a hundred feet high; the nose, with its long bridge; and the vast lips, if they had been able to speak, would have rolled their thundering accents from one end of the valley to the other."
"As they had almost all the conveniences of life in themselves, they rarely visited cities or cities in search of superfluousness. They were still away from politeness, keeping the primitive simplicity of manners; and, frugal by habit, they knew little that temperance was a virtue. They worked cheerfully on working days, but observed parties as intervals of idleness and pleasure. They kept the Christmas carol, sent knots of love on Valentine's Day morning, ate pancakes on Shrovetide, showed their spirit on April 1st, and religiously cracked on Michaelmas-eve. Learned from our approach, the whole neighborhood came to meet their minister, dressed in their finest clothes and preceded by a pipe and a tabor: a party, too, was planned for our reception, at which we sat joyfully, and what the conversation wanted in spirit was made in laughter."
"Corky was one of the artists. A portrait-painter, he was called himself, but he had not painted portraits. He was sitting on the side with a blanket on his shoulders, waiting for a chance to get into the game. You see, the portrait-painting taking — I looked into the thing a little — is that you can't start painting portraits until people come to ask you, and they won't come to ask you so long as you painted a lot first. This makes it hard enough for a chappie. Corky managed to get along by drawing an occasional picture for comics— he had a gift for funny things when he had a good idea— and making beds and chairs and things for advertising. His main source of income, however, was derived from biting the ear of a rich uncle — an Alexander Worple, who was in jute business."
"Lemaire had a beautiful face and was a handsome, cunning, bold, muscular, determined man. He did not belong to Marseilles, but had come there to give an acrobatic spectacle in a music room; and there Marie Bretelle had seen him, dressed in silver pantyhose, and making wonderful exploits on three parallel bars. Her bare arms had lumps on them like iron balls, her fair mustaches were trained in points, her bold eyes were lit with a fire to fascinate the women; and ""Well, Marie Bretelle fled with him and became Madame Lemaire. So she came to Algiers, where Lemaire had an accident giving her performances. And it was the beginning of the Odyssey that had ended in El-Kelf.""Fool – fol – fool!"" Often she said that, as she was going to the inn to make her sand grains in her hair."
"The corollary in Flanders, unless it can be demonstrated, would be as great a failure as Picardy's main proposal. And the question still possible of Picardy depended, as we shall see, on a complete demonstration of the first. Both have so far been handicapped by the increased mobility of the Allies, their increasing number, their centralized command, and their successful insistence on controlling the air. This was the situation in Flanders and Picardy which confronted Ludendorff at the dawn of the second month of the German offensive. The whole problem to be solved was just as obvious to the Allies as it was to himself – to win the barriers that threatened his angles of penetration, in order to use once again his dominant forces of men and cannons on a wide front."
"Taking advantage of the opportunity, James Montgomery Flagg has now appeared in his van studio at the southern fringe of the Broad Street crowd. A girl with him played something on the cornet. It was a good deal like a Midway show at a western county fair. But it was not a fake — one of the most famous artists in America, throwing in a signed sketch of who bought Liberty's ties. Those close to him started pushing and treading to take advantage of the offer. And now, suddenly, a huge racket on the street towards Broadway. Who's coming? Hi, now. It's the ""Anzacs."" Twelve long, groggers, officers all, six or seven of them with the little brass ""A"" on the shoulder, which means service in Gallipoli and Flanders. They are members of the contingent of 500 who arrived here yesterday on his way to the fields of France."
"In October 1776 Congress authorized a second loan of $5 million, which was not a big success, only $3,787,000 was raised in twelve months. In 1778, fourteen paper money issues were authorized as the only way to meet the military's expenses. By the end of the year 1779 Congresses had issued $200 million in paper money, while a similar amount had been issued by several states. In 1781, as a result of this financing and the general situation, the continental letters of credit had fallen by 99 per cent. Then came Robert Morris, the financial genius, who found ways to raise the money that ensured the triumph of the American cause."
"The tax on spirits is increased to $7.50 per gallon; on beer to $12.50 per barrel; on tobacco to $2.04 per pound, the effect of which will increase the price by 4 cents per ounce, while the cheaper cigarette, now 6 cents per ten, will be 7 cents per ten. The tax on matches is increased so that they will be sold at 2 cents per box instead of 1 cent. An additional duty of 3 cents the weight is levied on sugar, so that the sugar sold so far at 11 cents per pound will now have to be sold at 14 cents per pound. A tax of 16 and two thirds is levied on the sale of luxury, including jewellery, and items above a certain price when they become luxury items; also on hotel and restaurant bills. This tax will be collected by means of stamps."
"On 16 April, Mr Gukovsky, the Commissioner for Finance, reported to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets on the financial and industrial situation of Russia. He said that the half-yearly expenditure would amount to 4 0000.000 rubles, while the expected income was only 3 3000.000 rubles. The railways had lost 70 per cent of their cargo capacity, and the operating cost had increased ten times, (120.000 versus 11,600 rubles per versta). The central government, he said, did not draw tax revenues, because the local Soviets used the sums they collected for their own purposes. To illustrate the industrial conditions, the Commissioner cited the example of the work of Sormov locomotives, whose daily production is two locomotives, instead of eighteen as before."
"On 7 May, General Maurice issued a letter stating that the Prime Minister had made a misleading statement in the House of Commons on 9 April, when he stated that the British army in France on 1 January 1918 was much stronger than on 1 January 1917; that he did not recognize the facts concerning the number of white divisions in Egypt and Palestine; that Bonar Law, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had made a mistake in denying that the extension of the British front in France had been ordered by the Versailles War Council; a resolution was presented by former Prime Minister Asquith with a view to the appointment of a committee to investigate the accusations; the Lloyd George government accepted the challenge and announced that it would consider the adoption of the resolution as a censorship vote and would resign if it were adopted; the debate on the resolution took place on 9 May and would lead to an overwhelming victory for the government, with the vote to maintain the Lloyd George Ministry from 293 to 106; and the Irish members were not present."
"The month of December was an anxious month. Several German divisions were east of the Piave, and an attempt to force the river and capture Venice was considered probable. Local attacks were becoming more and more severe, and, although the enemy's progress was not great and Italian counter-attacks were constantly made, the danger of a breakthrough was increasing. The Austrians were encouraged to persevere in the hope of descending towards the plains for the winter. Rear defence lines were built, and the time passed and preparations were well advanced, the feeling of security was growing, and the Italians' resumption of the slopes of Monte Asolone on 22 December. The next day, Mount Melago and Col del Rosso, on the plateau of Asiago, were lost, but the Italians resumed the first with a counter-attack."
"The activities of the Soviets of the National Economy are limited to the industrial field. Their counterpart in agriculture are the land committees. The decree on agrarian socialization, voted by the Bolsheviks at 2 A.M., 8 November 1917, recommends the use of a certain nakaz (mandate), based on 242 resolutions adopted by the village communities, as a guide in the implementation of the agrarian reform. Article 8 of this nakaz, which is a paraphrase of the agrarian program of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, reads as follows: ""The whole land, after confiscation, forms a national agrarian fund. The distribution of the land among the workers is taken over by the local and central self-management bodies. The land is periodically redistributed, with the growth of the population and the increase in the productivity of agricultural work."
"The Russian army no longer exists, and the Russian navy no longer exists. The Romanian army — the most gallant and unhappy body, which could and would have cooperated to preserve Russia and Romania from the tyranny of the central powers — had been betrayed by Russia itself. The unfortunate results of the revolution from a military point of view are quite clear and obvious to the most occasional observer. The current course of the Bolsheviks has made them completely powerless in the face of German aggression. Now they express the desire — I am sure they express it sincerely and sincerely — that they re-establish the Russian army for the purpose of Russian defence, and they would appreciate our help, no doubt, in the realization of this object. But can you reconstruct it for the purposes of national defence? Can you improvise a new instrument when fragments of the old instrument are broken around you?"
"The War Council was created because it was necessary to have a group of experts in the War Department who would have had time to study. Until the time of its organization, there was little time to think about the great problems and do nothing else. Everyone was in a hurry by some form of executive or administrative work. This council is in session every day and is one of the most effective war agencies the government has. There is no man on it who does not make a vital contribution to its deliberations and conclusions to the well-being of the country and the army. It consists of the War Secretary, the Deputy War Secretary General, General of March, Acting Chief of Staff; General Crowder, Judge Advocate General and Provost General of the Army, one of the great lawyers of the nation, who devotes his life to the military well-being of his country; Generals Crozier, Sharpe, Weaver and Pierce, and Charles Day, a competent engineer drawn up by the Merchant Navy Council to advise the War Department as a member of the War Council."
"We have now entered the most critical phase of this terrible war. There is a lull in the storm, but the hurricane is not over. Undoubtedly, we must expect more ferocious epidemics, and finally exhausted there will be much more. The fate of the empire, the fate of Europe and the fate of freedom throughout the world may depend on the success with which the last of these attacks is resisted and fought. The government, therefore, proposes today to submit to Parliament certain recommendations, in order to help this country and the Allies to cope with the storm."
"As soon as the advance of the tanks and the infantry, working in close cooperation, began, the artillery was to assist in counter-battery and barrage work; but no prior recording of the guns for this purpose could be permitted, as it would cause the enemy's suspicions. Therefore, the artillery of our new armies was necessarily subjected to a severe test in this operation, and proved to be quite worthy of the trust placed in it. The infantry, tanks and artillery working in combination were to attempt to break all the enemy's defence lines on the first day. If this had been accomplished successfully and the situation had developed favourably, the cavalry had to go through to attack the enemy's communications, to disrupt its command system, to damage its iron tracks, and to interfere as far as possible with the arrival of its reinforcements."
"I often wondered what she had become of this very interesting young woman, and when I started writing ""The White Morning"", she appeared in my mind. I think she could be a leader of one kind if she chose. Maybe she is. The cases could be multiplied indefinitely. The Erkels and Mimi Brandt are attracted, with their conditions, almost photographically. ""Heloise"" finally married a Scotsman and went with him to her own country, but her sisters were dragging their tragic lives when I left Munich. A few days ago, I met a very intelligent American woman of German blood who, before the war, used to visit her parents in Germany every year. I told her that I had written this story and she agreed with me that it was on the cards that women were instigating a revolution. ""Never,"" she says, in any country I have experienced such discontent among women, heard so many bitter confidencesences. Their feelings against their fathers and husbands were more violent than they were."""
"America sends almost two thirds of our food to these islands. Sixty-five per cent of the essential food consumed by the British citizen comes from the American continent. It is in itself something that calls for our deep gratitude. But there is a quality in America's action that should intensify our gratitude. Because these American food, essential to our health and safety, represent to a very large extent the personal and voluntary sacrifice of each of the American citizens. They are not crumbs of the Dives table. These are not the food of an autocratic government. Rather, they represent the personal, difficult and entirely voluntary sacrifice of an entire nation, the vast majority of which work. There is only one altar for this act of sacrifice, it is the table of the American working classes.And the rite is executed by men, women and children, every meal of the day, day after day, week after week."
"On 4 February 1917, an assembly of 200 Belgians speaking the Flemish language met and voted for the creation of a ""Council of Flanders"". On 3 March, this body sent a delegation to Berlin, and the Chancellor announced to him that ""the policy of administrative separation would be pursued with all possible vigour during the occupation"" and that ""During the negotiations and after the conclusion of the peace, the empire would not cease to watch over the development of the Flemish race."" The German decrees dividing Belgium into two administrative regions closely followed these declarations (21 March 1917). At the end of 1917, the German authorities believed that the time had come to consume the company by supplementing the administrative separation with a political separation."
"I was first surprised to find a new addition for an allied army in this part of France. Then I remembered that these small towns and villages have, in recent months, seen for the first time allies of France. The ports where the American troops saw many other allies; they saw, indeed, in August 1914, some of the first British land troops, whose reception remains in the memory of the inhabitants as a scene of such fervour and a enthusiasm full of love that never before known and probably will no longer be known. In fact, to say brutally, the French ports are blazed. But this central France welcomes for the first time allied troops. It is true that they had seen some Russians, but the least said of them now the best. Some Russians are still there, pulling wood for three francs a day per head, and behaving fairly peacefully. These old cities and villages look at the American army in the midst of them as the greatest miracle they have ever known, and one greater than they could ever have dreamed."
"We had every reason to believe that the government was considering immediate legislation on the results of our work. The work of an Irish settlement, suspended at the beginning of the war, now seems to admit that there was no longer any postponement. In the dominions and in the United States, as well as in other allied countries, the unresolved Irish question is a worrying factor both in terms of the war effort and the objectives of peace. However, since our task was urgent, we could not complete it until all the possibilities for agreement had been explored."
"The window of my room overlooks the road. The child had sat at my feet near my table, and played slowly, bowing down on his knees. I was hard to work on my seventeenth chapter, where Pratap Singh, the hero, had just taken Kanchanlata, the heroine, in his arms, and was about to escape with her through the third floor window of the castle, when all of a sudden Mini left his room, and ran to the window, shouting, ""A Cabuliwallah! a Cabuliwallah!"" Of course, in the street below was a Cabuliwallah, slowly passing along. He wore the loose and dirty clothes of his people, with a large turban; there was a bag on his back, and he was wearing boxes of grapes in his hand. I cannot say what my daughter felt at the sight of this man, but she began to call him loud."
"The boys bit at the log with all their strength, shouting, ""One, two, three, go!"" At the word ""go,"" the log went away; and with it went philosophy, glory and everything. The other boys shouted with joy. But Phatik was a little scared. He knew what was coming. And, quite sure, Makhan rose up from Mother Earth blind as fate and shouted like the Furies. He rushed to Phatik and scratched his face and struck him and then he went to the house to cry. The first act of the drama was finished. Phatik wiped his face, and sat on the edge of a barge swallowed near the shore, and began to chew a piece of grass. A ship went up to the landing and a man of medium age, with gray hair and dark moustache, walked on the shore. He saw the boy sitting there doing nothing and asked him where the Chakravortis lived."
"The rain and the storm had been incessant. The whole city was flooded. The water was on its knees in our alley. I had a tense hope, which was almost a certainty, that my tutor would be prevented from coming that night. I sat on the stool in the corner of the veranda looking down the way, with a heart beating more and more quickly. Every minute I kept my eye on the rain, and when it began to decrease, I prayed with all my power: ""Please, God, send even more rain until seven and a half hours are over."" For I was quite ready to believe that there was no need for rain but to protect a defenceless boy one night in a corner of Calcutta from the deadly claws of his guardian. If I do not answer my prayer, in any case according to a rougher law of nature, the rain did not yield."
"""Very well, baby,"" he said, ""you sit still in the cart, and I'm going to get you the pretty flower. Only, you don't get near the water."" As he said, he put his bare legs in the knee, and threw himself into the boiling mud towards the tree. At the time when Raicharan was gone, his little Master's thoughts went at the speed of running towards the forbidden water. The baby saw the river rushing through, splashing and numbing while he was going. It seemed that the disobedient waves themselves were running away from a great Raicharan with the laugh of a thousand children. In the sight of their bad luck, the heart of the human child became excited and agitated."
"But here Nature fulfilled her lack of speech and spoke for her. The murmur of the stream, the voice of the people of the village, the songs of the boaters, the shouts of the birds and the rustling of the trees were mixed and one with the trembling of her heart. They became a vast wave of sound that was beating on her troubled soul. This murmur and the movement of Nature were the tongue of the mute girl; this speech of the dark eyes, which the long lashes shaded, was the language of the world around her. Trees, where the cicadas shouted, with quiet stars, were only signs and gestures, weeping and sighing. And in the middle of the deep noon, when the boaters and the fishermen went to their dinner, when the villagers slept and the birds were still, when the ferryboats were idle, when the great busy world stopped in his work and suddenly became a lonely giant, then under the vast impressive skies, there was only the silent nature, the little girl sitting, and the little one lay down."
"A midday, during a pause under the rains, a cool breeze was blowing; the smell of wet grass and leaves in the warm sun felt like the warm breath of tired earth on the body. A persistent bird continued all afternoon repeating the burden of its only complaint in the audience room of Nature. The postmaster had nothing to do. The radiance of freshly washed leaves, and the remains of the sitting of the rain clouds in retreat were visions to see; and the postmaster looked at them and thought of himself: ""Oh, if only a nice soul was close — just a loving human being that I could hold close to my heart!"" It was exactly, he continued to think, what this bird was trying to say, and it was the same feeling as the whispering leaves were trying to express themselves. But no one knows, or would believe, that such an idea could also take possession of a poorly paid village postmaster in the deep and silent interval of his work."
"It was difficult to say the age of Nilkanta. If he was about fourteen or fifteen years old, then his face was too old for his years; if seventeen or eighteen, then he was too young. He was either a man too early or a boy too late. The fact was that, joining the theatre group when very young, he had played the parts of Radhika, Damaanti, and Sita, and a thoughtful Providence so arranged the things that he grew up to the exact stature that his director demanded, and then the growth ceased. Since everyone saw how little Nilkana was, and he himself felt small, he did not receive due respect for his years. Causes, natural and artificial, combined to make him sometimes appear immature for seventeen years, and at other times a simple boy of fourteen but much too well-known even for seventeen. And since no sign of hair appeared on his face, the confusion became greater."
"When the goddess of the Fortune deserts a house, she usually leaves some of her burdens behind her, and this old family was still filled with her dependents, although her own shelter almost collapsed to dust. These parasites take for an insult if they are asked to do some service. They have a headache at least the contact of the smoke of the kitchen. They are visited with a sudden rheumatism at the moment when they are asked to shop. Therefore, all the responsibilities to maintain the family were placed on Rashmani herself. Women lose their delicacy of refinement, when they are forced night and day to mingle with their destiny on things that are pitifully small, and for this they are blamed by those for whom they work. In addition to his domestic affairs Rashmani had to keep all the accounts of the little property that remained and also to make arrangements to collect rents. Never before was the estate managed with such rigour. Bhavani had been quite unable to perceive his dues: Rashmani never made any remission of the fraction of rent."
"During the Franco-Prussian war, General de Cissy was taken prisoner by the Germans. During his stay in Germany, the Baroness of Kaula became very intimate and the young woman, a Levantine by birth, became confident. After the restoration of peace, General de Cissy returned to Paris, where he soon became a great factor in the reconstruction of the French army. In 1875 he was minister of war and great things were expected for the Army of the Revanche. Upon the order of Bismarck, Baroness de Kaula received her instructions from Dr. Stieber and was ordered to join the old French general in Paris. Undoubtedly flattered, General de Cissy welcomed him. The Baroness was installed in a private apartment where the old general came every day after breakfast to listen to his beautiful piano or give his opinion on his new French poem."
"""I swear that there are dozens of men sitting there in these dark hours of war who wrote and said similar things in brighter and bitterer words."" Herr Harden asked if they would meet the same fate if their papers were stolen and displayed in the German windows. ""Many of a woman of trust,"" he said, ""must shout in fear: 'But, you know, Ernst, Adolf, and Klaus spoke more desperately.' The main theme of Lichnowsky's memorandum, says Die Zukunft's editor-in-chief, was the danger to Germany of an too close alliance with Vienna and Budapest, of flirting with Poland, and of his insistence on the need for friendly relations with a strong Russia."
"For two years, all our bad news had come from this council — lost battles, conscriptions, orders from the seat; and I said to myself without stopping: ""What can it be now?"" So, while I was running in the square, Wachter the blacksmith, who was there with his apprentice, reading the badge, called me: ""Don't hurry, my boy; you will arrive at your school early enough!"" I thought he was laughing at me, and I was running into Mr. Hamel's little courtyard without breath. Usually, at the beginning of the school, there was a great outcry that could be heard in the street, offices opening and closing, repeated lessons in unison, with our ears stuffed to learn faster, and the head of school was beating on the desk: ""A little quieter!"" I counted on all this noise to reach my bench without notice; but as it happened, everything was calm, like a Sunday morning."
"This is the story of a man who, under the command of his ships and when everything went well with him, was so hard and so cruel that some of his men, in despair of the treatment they received, mutinated against him. But history shows another side of his character in adversity, which it is impossible not to admire. In 1787, Captain Bligh was sent from England to Otaheite in charge of the Bounty, a ship that had been specially equipped to transport young fruit plants for transplant in the West Indies. ""The fruit grows on a tree that extends over the size of a large apple tree; the fruit is round, and has a thick and hard crust. It is gathered when it is grown, and while it is still green and hard; it is then cooked in an oven until the crust is black and burnt."
"""Exactly, my dear Watson, he could have proved an alibi. We will assume, for the sake of argument, that the house of Wisteria Lodge is confederate in a certain design. The attempt, whatever it is, is to go out, we will say, before an hour. By some jugglings of the clocks it is quite possible that they did Scott Eccles in bed earlier than he thought, but in any case, it is likely that when Garcia came out of his way to tell him that it was really one it was no more than twelve. If Garcia could do all that he had to do and be back at the time mentioned he obviously had a powerful answer to any accusation. Here's this irreproachable English ready to swear in any court that the accused was in the house all the time. It was an assurance against the worst."""
"In the astonishment that followed, the colonel hesitated. Should he station a whole company at the post? This would probably prevent further losses; but then it was unlikely to explain the mystery; for the hands that had carried three sentinels, it was reasonable to believe, would not make a whole company of men's mind. And for the future action as well as to put an end to the superstitious terror of the soldier, the vital necessity was to clarify the mystery. He had no belief in the theory that these men had deserted. He knew them too well. He himself prided himself on his own regiment and had well-founded reasons of pride in his men. For this reason, he was the haughtiest to expose a fourth brave man where three had already been lost. However, it was necessary to do so. The poor man whose turn was to take up the post, although a soldier of proven courage and even carefreeness in action, shook positively from head to foot."
"Of course, they made only slow progress, so that when they rose on the top of a swell, which was still very long and raised due to the storm, they could only discover the distant land, Muckish, a remarkable flat mountain on the northwestern coast of Ireland, not very far from the promontory called the Bloody Foreland. There seemed to have been little discipline among this forlorn crew, even when the breeze was in their favour; but when the wind was cut around, and blew out of the coast, they went into despair, put in their row, let the veil beat into pieces, gobbling all their provisions, and drinking all their water supply. Meanwhile, the boat, which had been partially panned, in the confusion of cleaning the ship, began to fill with water; and, as they all subsequently admitted, if it was not for the courage and patience of the women under this harsh trial, they had to go to the bottom."
"A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden there was a tree that bore apples of gold; and these apples were always numbered, and about the time when they began to ripen, it was found that one of them had left every night. And the king was angry with this, and commanded the gardener to watch all night under the tree. And the gardener placed his eldest son to watch; but at about twelve o'clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing; and the second son began to look; and at midnight he also fell asleep, and in the morning another apple went. And the third son offered to watch; but the gardener did not leave him at first, for he feared that something might happen to him; but at last he consented, and the young man lay under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve, he heard a noise rustling in the air, and a bird fled out of pure gold; and as he fell on the garden, and the young man fell on his face with an arrow."
"There was a young girl whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls who had been seen before, and a shepherd, whose name was Jorindel, was very much loved by her, and they were about to get married. One day they went into the woods so that they could be alone; and Jorindel said, ""We must be careful not to get too close to the castle of the fairy."" It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the sunset shone through the long stems of the trees on the green undergrowth, and the turtledoves sang great birches. Jorinda sat down to look at the sun; Jorindel sat by his side; and the two felt sad, they did not know why; but it seemed that they were separated from each other forever."
"An honest farmer once had a donkey who had been a faithful servant to him for many years, but was now old and every day more and more unfit to work. So his master was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to him; but the donkey, who saw that some evil was in the wind, got hurt, and began his journey to the great city, ""For there,"" he thought, ""I can become a musician."" After he had come a little way, he spied on a dog lying on the edge of the road and dressing as if he were tired.""What makes you so pissed, my friend?"" said the donkey.""Alas!"" said the dog, ""My master was going to hit me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make me useful to him in the hunt; so I ran away; but what can I do to earn my life?"" ""Hark you!"" said the donkey, ""I am going to the great city to make a musician: suppose that you can do this together, and you can do it with me."
"The wolf and the wild boar were the first on the ground; and when they were spying on their enemies who were coming, and they saw the long tail of the cat standing in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for the sultan; and every time she was boxing, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw them; and they said that they should not love this way of fighting, and the wild boar lay behind a bush, and the wolf leaped into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon went up, and looked and wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not completely hidden himself, for his ears were stuck out of the bush; and when he shook a little of them, the cat, seeing something moving, and thinking that it was a mouse, which had thrown itself from it, bit it and scratched it, so that the boar rose up and groaned, and fled, roaring, ""Look at the tree, here is the one to blame."
"In a village lived an old poor woman, who had gathered a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her home, and so that he would burn faster, she lit it with a handful of straw. When she emptied the beans in the pan, one fell unobserved, and lay down on the ground beside a straw, and shortly after, a coal burning from the fire jumped to both. The straw began and said, ""Dear friends, where do you come from here?"" The coal answered, ""I fortunately went out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by pure force, my death would have been certain, I would have been burned with ashes."" The bean said, ""I escaped with whole skin, but if the old woman had brought me into the pan, I would have been made in a broth without mercy, like my comrades."""
"And it came to pass on the very day that she was fifteen years old, that the king and the queen were not at home, and was left alone in the palace. Then she rolled all by herself, and looked at all the rooms and all the rooms, until she finally came to an old tower, where there was a narrow staircase ending with a small door. In the door there was a key of gold, and when she turned it, the door opened and sat down an old lady who turned very hard. ""Why now, good mother,"" said the princess; ""what are you doing there?"""
"A shepherd's dog had a master who did not take care of him, but often suffered from the greatest hunger. Finally, he could no longer bear her; he took the heels, and fled from a very sad and sad mood. On the road, he met a sparrow who said to him, ""Why are you so sad, my friend?"" ""Because,"" said the dog, ""I am very hungry and have nothing to eat."" ""If that's all,"" replied the sparrow, ""Come with me to the next city, and I will soon find you a lot of food."" Soon they went together to the city, and as they passed by a butcher's shop, the sparrow said to the dog, ""Stay there a little until I put a piece of meat on you."""
"Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of gold; and then to a third, where the leaves were all glittering diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch of each; and every time there was a loud noise, which caused the younger sister to tremble with fear; but the eldest said again, it was only the princes, who cried out with joy. Then they went until they came to a great lake; and on the side of the lake there were twelve small boats with twelve beautiful princes, who seemed to wait there for the princesses. One of the princesses entered into each boat, and the soldier entered the same boat with the youngest one. As they were rowing over the lake, the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said: ""I don't know why, but although I am rowing with all my strength we don't climb as fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today."
"Once in the summer, the bear and the wolf walked in the forest, and the bear heard a bird sing so beautifully that he said, ""Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?"" ""This is the king of birds,"" says the wolf, ""before whom we must bow down."" In reality, the bird was the willow. ""If this is the case,"" says the bear, ""I would love to see his royal palace; come, take me there. ""It is not done as you seem to think,"" says the wolf; ""you must wait for the queen to arrive,"" shortly afterwards, the queen arrives with food in her beak, and the king lord also came, and they began feeding their young people. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him by the handle, and said, ""No, you must wait for the lord and the queen to leave."
"Then the king said to the young princess, ""As you have given your word, you must keep it; go and let it in."" She did so, and the frog fell into the room, and then straight away — tap, tap, tap, tap, plash — from the bottom of the room to the top, until he went up by the table where the princess was sitting. ""Pray me on the chair,"" he said to the princess, ""and let me sit next to you."" As soon as she had done this, the frog said, ""Put your plate closer to me, so that I may eat it."" She did so, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ""Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me in your bed."" And the princess, even if she did not want, took it into her hand, and put it on the pillow of his own bed, where he slept all night."
"When I was small, I lived in one of those rustic neighborhoods on the outskirts of the great woods of Maine. Foxes were numerous, because almost all these clearings of sunny pioneers reproduce by thousands, just like field mice and squirrels, making a lot of game for Reynard. There were red foxes, ""crusaded grasses"" and ""silver grasses"", even black foxes. These animals were pests of the farms, and were wreaking havoc with geese, cats, turkeys and chickens. In the autumn of the year, especially after the frosts, the clearings were invaded by them night and morning. Their pointed barks, cur-like type, were often used to wake us up, and with a dark evening, we heard them in the fields, ""mowing"" around the stone lopins, making a queer sound, grinning like a mouse, to call the true mice of their grass nests inside the stones."
"It was about nine o'clock in the morning when the ship appeared for the first time. At the same time there was the greatest excitement in the village. It was a British warship. What would it do? Would it be in the bay to pick up wandering submarines as a price, or would it land soldiers to burn the city? In both cases there would be enough problems. It were the sad days, these old wartimes in 1812. The sight of a British warship in Boston Bay was not pleasant. We were then poor, and did not have monitors to get out and sink the enemy or hunt it. Our navy was small, and although we had the victory and returned the agitated ships, never returned, at that time they often approached enough, and the good people in the small village of Scituate Harbor were in great distress on the strange ship that had appeared at the mouth of the port."
"It was vain to sit down and wish for what was not there; and this end aroused my application. We had several rescue yards, and two or three large wooden spades, and a relief topmast or two in the ship; I decided to fall to work with them, and I threw as many of them overboard as I could for their weight, hooking each with a rope, so that they could not get away. When this was done, I went down to the side of the ship, and pulled them towards me, I bound four of them together at both ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and I laid two or three short pieces of boards on them, I realized that I could very well walk on, but that he was not able to carry a great weight, the pieces being too light."
"Two of them, whose captain was less sure than usual, I sent on Friday, and one of the three men delivered into my cave, where they were far enough away, and in danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they had been able to escape. Here they left them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised them, if they continued quietly there, to give them their freedom in a day or two; but if they tried to escape, they should be put to death without mercy. They faithfully promised to carry their confinement with patience, and they were very grateful for having had such use that provisions and light left them; for on Friday they gave candles (as we did to us) for their comfort; and they did not know, but they stood above them at the entrance."
"The ship was thrown on an island, and Prospero and her little one landed safely. But this island was enchanted, and for years had lain under the fate of a fallen witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunks of trees all the good spirits that she found there. She died shortly before Prospero was thrown on those shores, but the spirits, of which Ariel was the head, remained still in their prisons. Prospero was a great magician, for he had almost entirely devoted himself to the study of magic during the years when he had allowed his brother to manage the affairs of Milan. By his art, he freed the imprisoned spirits, but kept them according to his will, and they were more truly his subjects than his people in Milan. For he treated them kindly as long as they did his orders, and he exercised his power over them wisely and well."
"When Grandma Lane was a little girl, her father came one day and said, ""Wife, everything is finally settled. I sold the farm. Next week we're going to start the West. There's a big company going from here, and we have to try to get ready to go with them."" Little Mary, as grandmother was then called, heard the news with great pleasure, because she knew it would mean a long, long journey, lasting months, and transport them to a new country, where there was never a cold weather and where great cultures could be raised without a lot of hard work, and there would always be a lot to eat."
"At about eleven o'clock, when the whole house was still, the window of the June closet opened slowly. There was a covered door just below, with an old vine truss running on one side. A small dark figure came out timidly on the narrow and steep roof, clinging with his hands to keep his balance, then descended on the lattice, which he began to crawl slowly. The old wood crept and moaned and trembled, and the little figure trembled and stopped. If he had to yield, and fall down to the ground! She stood down for a minute looking down; then she took a slow and careful step; then another and another hand under her hand on the bars. The tresss dug and trembled and shook, but he held, and June held, and let down slowly, fainting and terrified at what she had done, all in a small pile on the grass underneath."
"As they rounded up the rock spur that had made the watch tower of the watchpiece, the whole scene burst upon their eyes. There was a wide and soft space in the valley, made as if for the great appointment. A dish of green cotton wood adhered to the bank of the river. ""Benches"", or natural terraces, of soft grass rose along the hill half a mile away. Hundreds of horses, picked or hobbled, grinned here and there. Others, favorite walkers of their masters, stood at the doors of the lodges, which were raised with long tufted spears, in the heraldic of this land insignia of the rank of their owner. Tepees, one hundred two-cores, tents of skin of tribes and also of white houses, were gathered irregularly on a space of more than half a mile."
"Just above the cliffs grew a number of dwarf spruces, some of them with trunks six inches in diameter, while being flat along the ground, so that the twigs scratched and pressed by the wind were barely high from the knee. They were so tight, and so stiff, that I could not pass between them; but on the other hand, they were strong enough to support my weight, so that I could walk on their top when it was not convenient to move. A few small brown sparrows, of two or three species, lived there, and they were very talkative."
"When the sun went down, an old man came through the forest where the poplars lived. The trees were going to sleep, and he was darkening. The man was holding something under his coat. It was a pot of gold, the pot of gold that was at the foot of the rainbow. He had stolen it and was looking for a place to hide it. A poplar was standing on the way. ""This is the very place where my treasure is hidden,"" says the man. ""The branches stretch straight, and the leaves are large and thick. How lucky that the trees are all asleep!"" He placed the pot of gold in the thick branches, then fled quickly. The gold belonged to Iris, the beautiful girl who had a rainbow bridge on the earth. The next morning, she lacked her precious pot. He was still lying at the foot of the rainbow, but he was not there now."
"The feeling between the Americans of the two parties was more violent than that between the patriots and the British troops, and before long it became quite dangerous for any tory to stay in its own home in New Jersey. Many of them went to New York, where patriotic sentiment was not so strong at that time, and they formed in a regular military company called the ""associated loyalists""; and this company was commanded by William Temple Franklin, son of the great Benjamin Franklin, who had been appointed governor of New Jersey by the British Crown. He was now considered with great hatred by the patriots of New Jersey, because he was a strong tory. This difference of opinion between William Franklin and his father was the most notable example of this state of sentiment that occurred at that time."
"A pet grizzly bear had been for a number of years a feature in Hartranft's. Like a pony baby, barely able to crawl, Solomon, as he was solemnly nicknamed, was brought off the mountains of Teton, and since milk was rarer than money at the horse's run, he was aristocratically fed with malted milk. On this expensive diet, the pussy was stifled in an amazing way. Good food was continued after his rubber nipple weaning, and at the end of three years Solomon had grown to be a fat wool monster. He was held in chains at a post in the warm season, and had a shelf closed in a large barn for his winter quarters."
"The fourth of July 1862 was a gala day at Roanoke Island. The island camps and the ships in the harbour were in holiday clothes. The colors were flying, the bands were playing, the drums were beating, the patriotic steam was at high pressure. The good old day, so dear to the heart of the Americans, was made more glorious by the exchange of camp hospitalizations and a indulgence in such a simple hilarity that the occasion seemed to require; but ""Jeff"" was not forgotten. Early in the morning, it was bathed and rubbed, more than the heart of its contents, then patriotically decorated. In his right ear was a red ribbon, in his left one white; around his neck another blue. Thus, he was brought to the shore to visit me, and as he came by my door, he seemed filled with pride of patriotism and a realization of the grandeur of the occasion."
"Some of the stories told about his childish luminosity are hard to believe. They relate, for example, that before the age of two he could speak almost as clearly and clearly as an adult; that he could repeat many passages of ""Pilgrim's Progress"", to have heard, before he could read; and that at the age of five he could read very quickly, and remembered almost everything he read. His father, the wood sculptor, had died while Humphry was still very young, and had left his family poor. But, by good luck, a good neighbour and friend, Mr. Tonkine, took care of the widow and his children, and obtained a place for Humphry as an apprentice with an apothecary of the city. Humphry proved, in fact, a rather embarrassing inmate of the apothecary's house. He set up a chemical laboratory in his small room upstairs, and he devoted himself to all sorts of experiments."
"Charles Goodyear was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1801. He was the eldest of the six children of a prominent material merchant of this place, a man of both piety and inventive talent. When Charles was little, his father began making items of material, and at the same time carried on a farm. He often needed his son's help, so Charles' education was limited. He loved books very much, however, from an early age, and instead of playing with his companions, devoted most of his free time to reading. It was even while he was a schoolboy that his attention was first turned to material, whose improvement for common purposes became his work of life."
"To the student of French history and character nothing that the French did in this war is not surprising; however, it seemed to me that I had a new revelation every day during my stay in France in the summer of 1916. Each woman in each class (with some notable exceptions seen for the most part in the Ritz hotel) worked on something or other: either in self-support, to relieve distress, or to supplement the efforts and expenses of the government (two billion francs per month); and it seemed that I should never see the last of these relief agencies of the infinite variety known as ""works"". Some of these works are positively creative, many are original, and everything is practical and indispensable. Since the most interesting of them is to make its pivot of the central image of history that I had the chance to meet and to know as well as their days and mine would allow, it seemed to me that the most sure way to liven up any account of the work itself is to make its pivot of the central image of history."
"What started, in the spring of my actual reference, in a few rooms on the ground floor of number 7 of Half-Moon Street, was simply an establishment within a few days of a personal relationship with London that was not, of course, measurable at the present time — I have seen in my state of comparative freedom too many other relations ahead, a rather intoxicating vision of choice and reach — but that, nevertheless, a more intimate inner consciousness, a wheel in the wheels, and led to my departure, the real, the general incident closed, in possession of a ""good"" return ticket, as we say, for a longer interval than I could then dream, and that the first true whisper after years has surprisingly brought to light. I think it must have been the very proportions of the invitation and interest that kept me, under the immense impression, all in the nature of the calculation and the presumption; dark, huge and prodigious the other part of our relationship, London and mine, as I called it, waking me up and spreading too much to myself."
"Once upon a time in a certain village in a province of Spain called La Mancha, a man named Quixada or Queseda, whose house was full of old spears, halberds, and other weapons. He was also the owner of an old target or shield, a raw dandelion and a quick juniper. His food consisted every day of common meat, a few lentils on Fridays, and perhaps a roasted pigeon for Sunday dinner. His dress was a black suit with velvet panties, and slippers of the same color, which he kept for holidays, and a pun costume at home that he wore on weekdays. At the purchase of these few things, he spent the small rents that came to him every year. He had in his house a servant of about forty years, a niece not yet twenty, and a boy who served him both on the field and at home, and could take over his horse or take care of a hook."
"The innkeeper cried to them to leave him alone, for he had already told them that he was crazy. But Don Quixote cried louder than the innkeeper, calling them all disloyal and treacherous, and that the lord of the castle was a treacherous and evil knight to allow them to use a knight-believer so low; and if he had only received the order of knight, he would have punished him soundly for his betrayal. Then, calling the bearers, he said: ""You, base and ruffians satisfied, you are in my opinion. Throw me, approach me, and do me all the evil that you can, for you have long received the reward of your insolence."" These words, which he uttered with great spirit and boldness, struck a terrible fear to all those who assaulted him, and, partly moved by his threats and partly persuaded by the innkeeper, they let him throw stones, and allowed them to transport the wounded, while he returned to his custody."
"Don Quixote persuaded a certain worker, his neighbour, an honest man, but with a very shallow mind, to go away with him and serve him as a squire. He finally gave him so many beautiful words and promises that the poor man decided to go with him. Don Quixote, among other things, told him that he must be very happy to leave with him, for at some point or another an adventure could happen that should win him an island in the blink of an eye and leave him governor of it. On the faith of these promises and others like, Sancho Panza (for he was called) abandoned his wife and his children and took service as squire to his neighbour. While they were traveling, Sancho Panza said to his master: ""I pray you are well cared for, Mr. Knight, that you do not forget that the government of the island that you promised me, for I will never be able to govern him as great."""
"The others, Cardenio, the barber and Sancho Panza, followed on foot. And as they went up, Don Quixote said to the girl: ""Madam, let me ask you to direct the way that you like most."" Before she could answer, the curate said: ""To what kingdoms would you travel? Are you for your native land of Micomicon?"" She, who knew very well what to answer, not being very small, replied: ""Yes, sir, my way is to this kingdom."" ""If this is the case, says the curate, you must pass through the village where I live, and from there your lady must take the road to Carthagena, where you can embark. And if you have a prosperous journey, you can come in the space of nine years to Lake Meona, I mean Meolidas, which lies on this side of the kingdom of your highness, a few hundred days or more."""
"After crossing the Traun, burning the bridge at Mauthhausen, and passing the Enns, Napoleon's army advanced to Mölk, without knowing what had become of General Hiller. Some spies assured us that the archduc had crossed the Danube and joined him, and that we should meet tomorrow all the Austrian army, heavily stationed in front of St. Pölten. In this case, we must prepare ourselves to fight a great battle; but if that were the case, we should walk quickly to Vienna to get there before the enemy could reach it on the other side."
"A wise and righteous monarch was the good King John. His kingdom stretched out over central Italy, and included the famous city of Atri, which was once a famous port on the shores of the Adriatic. Now the sea had withdrawn, and it lay inside; the more the waves of arms rolled over its borders, or threw their showers of money to meet the turquoise shining out of heaven. The great desire of good King John was that every man, woman and child in his dominions should be able to obtain justice without delay, whether rich or poor. To this end, since he could not listen to all of himself, he hung a bell in one of the towers of the city, and published a proclamation to say that, when he was directed, a magistrate would immediately go to the public square and administer justice in his name. The plan worked admirably; the rich and the poor were satisfied, and as they knew that the wrongdoers would soon be punished, and the wrongs were correct, the men would often hesitate to wrong him, and often to wrong him for a long time."
"Sitting on warm skins by the fire, the storyteller cried out, ""Hanio!"" It meant, ""Come, gather, and I will tell a story."" Then all shouted, ""Hey,"" and came near to the fire. It meant that they were happy to hear the story. And as the flames leaped and continued one another along the path of fire, they heard these amazing stories of the Little People, trees and flowers, birds, animals and men. When the storyteller had finished, he said, ""Na ho."" This meant, ""It is the end."" The earth was very young, when the Iroquois first learned how everything had happened, and therefore the things were as they were. They told their children these wonderful things, and their children told them in turn; and these children told them again that these things could not be forgotten."
"One day Betty's father said, ""Let's go to town tomorrow. President Washington crosses the South, and a man told me today that he would be in Salisbury tomorrow."" ""Yes,"" said Robert, Betty's brother, and our company was invited to walk in the parade. One of the boys is going to make a welcome speech."" ""I'd like to go,"" said their mother, ""but I can't leave the house."" ""Oh, yes, you can,"" said Betty. ""I've stayed here many times, and I can stay tomorrow. You go with the father, and I'll take care of things."" The next morning, every person on the spot was standing before the sun. Robert was so eager to start the city that he could barely eat. Mother was so excited that she forgot to put coffee in the coffee maker."
"Every time M. Prideaux went out for a walk, Turk was sure to be near his heels. Street dogs barked and fell into the giant as his massive form drew their attention, but Turk was rarely condescended to notice such vulgar manifestations; he was a noble creature, somewhat like a little lioness; but although he was gentle and calm in his disposition, he had repeatedly been provoked beyond endurance, and his attack had almost always been fatal to his assailants. He slept at night in front of his master's door, and no sentry could be more alert on his watch than the faithful dog, who apparently had only one ambition — to protect, and accompany his owner. M. Prideaux had a dinner party. He never invited ladies, but simply entertained his friends as a single; his dinners were only secondary to the quality of his guests, however, who were always men of reputation either in the literary world or in modern society."
"""Martha!"" came the impatient voice of her husband. ""Don't make people wait here in the cold."" She opened the storm door again, and this time she joined the three men and the only woman who was waiting for her in the big buggy two places. After she had the dresses tainted around her, she looked at the woman who was sitting next to her on the back seat. She had met Mrs. Peters the previous year at the county fair, and the thing she remembered was that she didn't look like a sheriff's wife. She was small and thin and didn't have a strong voice. Mrs. Gorman, sheriff's wife before Gorman went out and Peters came, had a voice that seemed somehow to support the law with every word. But if Mrs. Peters didn't look like a sheriff's wife, Peters did it by looking like a sheriff."
"England is convinced, and has repeatedly stated, in spite of its desire to limit arms spending and to adjust any dispute that may arise by way of arbitration, that its fleet must in all circumstances be superior, or in any case equal, to any possible combination in the world. England has a perfect right to strive for such a state of affairs, and precisely because of my position on the issue of disarmament, I am the last to cast doubt on it. It is quite another thing, however, to make such a claim the basis of a convention that must be recognized by all other Powers in peaceful agreement."
"In one of his journeys from China, the Pitt, an East Indian, had a young tiger on board among his passengers. He seemed as harmless and playful as a kitten, and he left everyone's greatest familiarity. He especially liked to crawl in the seamen's hammocks; and while he was lying on the deck, he suffered two or three of them to place his head on his back, like on a pillow. From time to time, he ran with pieces of meat; and although sometimes severely punished for theft, he carried the punishment he received with the patience of a dog. His main companion was a burrow, with which he played all sorts of tricks – stumble and roll on the animal in the most fun way, without hurting him."
"In a full moon of mellow hair, two large black eyes glistened like jet beads, behind a small cunning nose, absurdly short for a bear. Apart from his high shoulders, he was hardly more than a big ball of gray fur on four poles of the same material. But his claws were formidable, and he had the true grizzly spirit. The bear nursery at the zoological park in New York is a large courtyard with a tree of shade, a tree to climb, a pool, three dens and a rocky cliff. It never contains less than six small, and sometimes eight. Naturally, it is a good test of courage and temperament to transform a new bear into this royasteric crowd."
"He lived there once in a city of Persia two brothers, one named Cassim, and the other Ali Baba. Their father shared a small inheritance also among them. Cassim married a very rich woman, and became a rich merchant. Ali Baba married a woman as poor as him, and lived by cutting wood, and bringing her on three donkeys into the city for sale. One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, and had just cut wood enough to load his donkeys, he saw at a distance a great cloud of dust, which seemed to be approaching him. He observed it with care, and distinguished himself shortly after a body of horsemen, whom he suspected to be thieves. He decided to leave his donkeys to save himself. He climbed a large tree, planted on a high rock, whose branches were thick enough to hide it, and yet allowed him to see everything that was going on without being discovered."
"In the beginning, I was troubled by the evil of the sea, but I quickly recovered my health. During our journey, we touched several islands, where we sold or exchanged our goods. One day, we were incrusted near a small island, but little raised above water level, and looked like a green meadow. The captain ordered that his sails be put on, and allowed people so inclined to land. While we were having fun eating and drinking, and recovering from the weariness of the sea, the island of a sudden trembled and shook us terribly. The tremor of the island was noticed on board, and we were called to board quickly, for fear that we would all be lost; for what we took for an island turned out to be the back of a sea monster."
"After I had rested from the dangers of my third voyage, my passion for commerce and my love of novelty quickly took him away. So I settled my affairs, and I provided a stock of goods for the traffic that I had designed to engage. I took the route of Persia, travelled several provinces, and then arrived at a port, where I got on board. At the sea, we were invaded by such a sudden gust of wind that we forced the captain to lower his yards and take all the other precautions necessary to avoid the danger that was threatening us. But everything was in vain; our efforts had no effect; the sails were divided into a thousand pieces, and the ship was stranded; several merchants and sailors were drowned, and the cargo was lost. I had the good fortune, with several merchants and sailors, to climb on boards, and we were transported by the current on an island that was in front of us. There we found fruit and water from the source, which was thrown away from all our lives. We were left at night."
"So I bought goods, I went with them for the best seaport; and there, not to be obliged to depend on a captain, but to have a ship at my command, I stayed until a ship was built on purpose, at my charge. When the ship was ready, I went on board with my goods; but I did not have enough to load it, I agreed to take with me several merchants of different nations, with their goods. We sailed with the first right wind, and, after a long navigation, the first place that we touched was a deserted island, where we found an egg of a rock, equal in size to that I had previously mentioned. There was a young rock, just ready to hatch, and its beak had begun to break the egg. The merchants who landed with me broke the egg with hatchets, and made a hole in it, pulled out the young rock, piece, and roasted."
"On my return from my sixth journey, I had completely abandoned all thought of going back to sea; for, besides my age now requiring rest, I was no longer determined to expose myself to the risks that I had encountered, so that I had only thought of spending the rest of my days in peace. One day, however, an officer of the caliph asked me. ""The caliph,"" he said, ""said I told you that he should speak to you."" I followed the officer at the palace, where, being presented to the caliph, I greeted him by bowing down to him. ""Sindbad,"" he said, ""I need your services; you must carry my answer and present to the king of Serendib."" This commandment of the caliph was for me like a thunder."
"Hamilton tried to get New York to understand that she had to stay firm against the English rule. He organized meetings, gave addresses, wrote letters, newspaper articles and pamphlets. He then joined a military company and perfected herself in the science of war. There were frequent epidemics between the crowds of tory and whigs, and the breakup of the meeting of your opponents was considered a pleasant hobby. Then came the British ship ""Asia"" and opened fire on the city. This probably caused whips of many tories. The feeling of whig was increasing; gangs of men walked through the streets and the king's shops were broken, and prominent royalists found their houses threatened. Dr. Cooper, president of King's College, had been very pronounced in his reprimands at Congress and the Colonies, and a crowd went to his home."
"As far as I am concerned, on a previous trip I have already been able to fully appreciate the noble virtues of the American nation, and I am happy to take this opportunity to express all the admiration with which they inspire me. Since its independence, Belgium has been declared neutral in perpetuity. This neutrality, guaranteed by the powers, has recently been violated by one of them. If we had agreed to abandon our neutrality for the benefit of one of the belligerents, we would have betrayed our obligations to others. And it was the meaning of our international obligations and that of our dignity and honour that led us to the resistance. The consequences suffered by the Belgian nation have not been limited to the evil caused by the forced march of an invading army. This army not only seized a large part of our territory, but it has committed incredible acts of violence, the nature of which is contrary to the law of the nations."
"Jack Lawton looked on his side. The little silk badge with the red rose on it seemed very rich because he had a blue sailor top. Stephen felt his own red face too, thinking about all the bets on who would get the first place in the elements, Jack Lawton or him. A few weeks Jack Lawton got the card for the first and a few weeks he got the card for the first time. His white silk badge will flutter and flutter while he worked at the next sum and heard Father Arnall's voice. Then all his ardour passed and he felt his face pretty cool. He thought his face should be white because it was so cool. He couldn't get the answer for the sum but it didn't matter. White Roses and red roses: these colors were beautiful to think. And the cards for the first place and the second place and the third place were also beautiful colors: pink and cream and lavender. Lavande and the cream and pink roses were beautiful to think. Maybe a wild rose could be like these colors and he remembered the small color on the green spot."
"That night, in Dalkey, the train roared like this and then, when he entered the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed his eyes and the train was rolling and stopping; he was still rumbling, stopped. It was nice to hear him roar and stop, then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop. Then the top line guys started to go down the carpet in the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard who were allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the lower line tables and tables on the third line. And each man had another way of walking. He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to look at a game of dominos and one or two times he could hear the little gas song. The prefect was at the door with boys and Simon Moonan was bouncing himself with false sleeves. He told them something about Tulab."
"We told all this with such awareness that the reader himself could be convinced that it was impossible for little Akaki to receive another name. When and how he entered the Chancery and who named him, no one could remember. However many of his superiors could come and go, he was always seen in the same place, in the same attitude, occupied with the same work, and bearing the same title; so that people began to believe that he had come into the world as he was, with his bald forehead and the official uniform. In the chancery where he worked, no kind of notice was taken from him."
"It's a love story they tell in the Low Light Causeway that connects the West India Dock Road to the dark waste of water beyond. In Pennyfields, too, you can hear it; and I don't doubt that it's heard in the distant Tai-Ping, Singapore, Tokyo, Shanghai, and these other haunted people wonder if the wandering people of Limehouse go and where they come back so casually. It's a story of tears, and if you hear it in the lily language of yellow men, it would awaken your pity. In our bald speech, unfortunately, you have to lose its essential fragrance, that quality that will raise a matter of squalor in the higher spheres of passion and imagination, beauty and sadness."
"""The suggestion that Mr. Gerhard went to Berlin was made by Count von Bernstorff to the President of the White House Conference on Wednesday. The Ambassador described to the President the difficulties he had experienced in transmitting information to his Government. He could not use the cables, which were in the possession of the Allies. With regard to the wireless, the conditions made it almost impossible to send anything, except the most brief dispatches. Consequently, Germany was not well informed of the reasons which controlled the policy of the administration or the state of public sentiment. If his Government had been adequately informed, the Ambassador was confident that he would look at the requests of the United States in a different way. The President apparently appreciated the opinion presented by the Ambassador. In any case, he authorized him to send an agent to Berlin, and he was presumed to have been informed of the identity of the selected man. Count von Bernstorff asked Mr. Gerhard to be fully informed of the diplomatic situation, as well as of the public explanation."
"In Sir Edward Grey's ""White Paper"", Mr. Beck did not miss any important document because he examined the case of England well prepared through friendly eyes, and he did not come to ask him, ""Where are all the documents relating to Italian neutrality?"" Is he convinced that England was so uninterested in the question of whether it should fight two or three enemies, and whether its way to Egypt and India would be safe or threatened? There are many expeditions to and from Rome included in the ""White Book"", but not a mention of the position of Italy. The first document contains a letter to the British Ambassador in Berlin concerning the Austro-Serb relations. Is it not likely that Sir Edward Grey was called to this question by his ambassador in Vienna? Where is his letter? Or, if Sir Edward thought of it himself, why did he not mention his conversation also to Sir M. de Bunsen in Vienna? Where is this note? Should we assume that Sir M. de Bunsen made his first report on July 23rd?"
"After the great crisis of the First World War, which ended at the Vienna Congress, England's relations with the German states were quite good. People lived in the protective shadow of the great alliance; England was concerned with digesting the enormous prey that it had seized at the expense of all the other powers that had taken part in the war; continental Europe was striving, as far as it could, to heal the wounds and wounds that had remained behind the mementos of oppression but, despite all the glorious years. France had recovered most quickly; the treaties of Paris had recovered only part of the abundant harvest that it had collected following Napoleon's victories and coercive policy; the national soil was still fertile and the national consciousness was still imbued with the ""glory"" which the Corsican general, with the help of his own army and foreign troops, had gained for the French name."
"I believe that Machiavelli once said that a war which is necessary is also just. Given this sober, practical, political point of view, which ignores all moral considerations, has this war been necessary? Is it not, indeed, directly mad? No one threatened Italy; neither Austria-Hungary nor Germany. If the Triple Agreement was content with blandishments only the story will show later. Without a drop of blood flow, and without the life of a single Italian in danger, Italy could have obtained the long list of concessions that I recently read at the House—Territory in Tyrol and on the Isonzo as long as one hears the Italian discourse, satisfaction of the national aspirations in Trieste, a free hand in Albania, and the precious port of Valona. Why did they not take it?"
"On the high cover of Time, the years are like stars large and small, some of a lesser magnitude, some always brilliant with the splendor of supreme human achievements; and now it shines a year about which, indeed, no man can tell how great he will be; but all men know that he must be great. It is destined to drown every lesser year, even if the sun rises dims the stars of the morning with the day; it is a bright year with promise and crowded with bad manners also; for in the world at this time there are great differences that this year will go far to rise. This year must solve deep problems, determine the trend of human affairs for centuries, and influence the whole future history of civilization. This year can indeed see the question; at least it will serve to enlighten the near future when this question is accomplished."
"The change in Canada's active and voluntary commitment to the European war is the change from the fact that Canadians hold, as they have done before, that Britain was required to defend Canada, while Canadians were not required to defend Britain outside of Canada. ""dependence"" has not now been brought about; it has acted as an independence; it has recognized its participation with Britain in a common danger; it has proceeded in a completely voluntary, completely independent manner, to recruit, organize, dispatch and maintain great forces for the common cause. Canada's course has become that of a partner in accepting risks and contributing to expenditures."
"This request to pay a respectful tribute to you has given me the first true pleasure that I have felt since the good days of Liège. At this moment, you are the only King in the world whose subjects, without exception, unite in loving and admiring him with all the strength of their souls. This unique fate is yours, Sire. No man's ruler on earth has had it in the same degree as you. Despite the vastness of the sadness that surrounds you, I think you have the right to rejoice, and all the more so as your spouse, Her Majesty the Queen, shares this rare privilege with you. Sire, your name will be great in the centuries to come. You are in such perfect sympathy with your people that you will always be their symbol. Their courage, their tenacity, their strangled pain, their pride, their future greatness, their immortality all live in you. Our hearts are yours to their depths. And you are all of us. And this will remain you."
"Miss Marie Van Vorst, who treated the wounded at the American Ambulance in Paris, will tell you about it as an eyewitness. For her part, you will receive direct news of your splendid work of humanity. While she was caring for the wounded French, English and German, I was attached to another hospital in Chartres. So it happens that I have never seen the American Military Hospital created by you, but I am not in ignorance about it more than any other Parisian, indeed, than the majority of the French people. I know that the American Ambulance is the most remarkable hospital that the world has seen. I know that since the beginning of the war, you have provided the help of medical science to the wounded and that you have given not only money, but an institution, all ready, complete and of the most modern type, and even more than you have sent there your best surgeons and a small army of officers and nurses."
"Curiously, I went to Reims to make a sketch of the cathedral when the war broke out. I had begun to make a series of sketches of the great European cathedrals. Not engravings, but sketches of charcoal.""Let me say here too that the cathedrals should not be engraved for the most part. You lose too much shadows, even if you win online; but in the engraving you have to cross so much ink that the result is just ink, not the shadow of the whole. Charcoal gives you depth and transparency. I was eager to make a series of cathedrals, as I had done a series for Dickens and Thackeray books, and had planned to give it all my summer."
"The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and especially to have breakfast. Only then would he consider what he was going to do next, because he knew that he would not bring his thoughts to meaningful conclusions when he was lying in bed. He remembers that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by a clumsy lie, but it always turned out to be a pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginations were slowly resolved today. He had no doubt that the change of his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was a professional danger for traveling vendors."
"Mr Beck's allegation that the question ""Was England justified by the declaration of war against Germany?"" is easier to resolve than the questions ""Was Austria justified by the declaration of war against Serbia?"" and ""Was Germany justified by the declaration of war against Russia and France?"" proves two things: first, that its interest lies primarily in the justification of England; second, that it does not take into account the fundamental causes and recognizes only the precipitated causes of war."
"According to official government reports, there are barely 30,000 mobile soldiers in the continental United States, who are divided into fifty-two highly dispersed positions, which would not allow for rapid mobilization at any given time. Even this small force lacks officers, ammunition and equipment. Moreover, it does not have an organized reserve. Our National Guard, with few exceptions, is well below its strength of man-made paper, equipment and efficiency. Our coastal defences are inadequate, our fortifications do not have sufficient numbers and adequate organized reserves. Our Navy is neither adequate nor prepared for war. Our first line of defence, does not have enough troops, does not have ammunition and does not have an organized reserve of trained men. Our submarine fleet exists mainly on paper."
"In the past ten months, war supplies contracts estimated at more than $1,000,000 have been awarded to the United States. When the war was declared last August, the country was suffering from a severe industrial depression; many factories have closed their doors, others have been operating for short periods of time and jobless work. After the paralysing effect of the war announcement, the businessmen here have realized the great opportunity to supply them with war supplies that are to be requested soon. Their expectations were quickly met, as almost immediately most governments sent commissions to the United States. Some have received purchase orders, while others have been allowed to obtain prizes and submit samples."
"But it was only last night in this old and powerful city of Philadelphia that the greatest reasons for an alliance were brought to my mind abruptly. I had thought, rather loosely, that since we speak the same language, share many of the same traditions, and we also desire peace for the prosperity of our trade, surely an alliance between us was natural, and with a little effort could be made inevitable. The deeper, more political, and much greater reason of this camaraderie between the two nations had never definitively shaped to my conscience. The Enlightenment came to me during the conversation with two thoughtful Philadelphians whose mind is centered on something that transcends patriotism and which works with a beautiful courage and a remarkable ability for the triumph of their idea."
"The truth is that the whole Schleswig-Holstein question is the one that involves the modern principle of ""nationality"" and, as such, enters into the necessity of the current European crisis. It is widely understood by Dr Eliot and deliberately misunderstood by his criticism. Passing to consider Alsace-Lorraine, Dr Dernburg states that ""it had belonged to Germany until it was taken, against the will of the people, under Louis XIV."" In this statement, as in the treatment of the previous question, the facts are mutilated and erroneous impressions are given. Alsace, as we know, was included within the limits of the ancient Gaul, its original population was Celtic, and it passed, at the end of the fifth Christian century, under the domination of the Franks, one of which, Clovis, became the founder of the first French monarchy."
"The inevitable consequence of a depreciated currency must be an increase in prices, usually higher than the actual percentage of depreciation. To deal with this situation, there was no possible instrument in any other commercial country. The government fixed prices at which the goods could be sold. This medieval instrument could only be applied in a country where such state interference had been usual, and, of course, could give the notes the fictional purchasing power only within the country. After the fashion of Christian science, it was only necessary to believe that the notes were of value to make them; but in the cold world outside German jurisdiction, their value would be assessed by the chances of obtaining gold for them. Here, we find Germany in all the labyrinths of our former ""green backeism"", but still in possession of a large stock of gold. From the end of the war, it could be able to return to gold payments at an early date, just like France after the storm of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871."
"Most of the people of this country, including all those who work for peace, agree with you to deplore the vast armaments that European states have accumulated, and hope with you that after this war they can be reduced — and safely reduced — to thin dimensions. Their existence is a constant threat to peace. They promote this spirit of militarism that has brought these horrors to the world; for they create in the great countries of the continent a great and powerful military and naval caste who lives for war, speaks and writes constantly about war, and glorifies war as a good thing in itself. It is (as you say) to the peoples that we must now seek to safeguard international harmony. They carry the misery of war, they should have the power to stop the action of those who press them. Getting rid of secret diplomacy is more difficult in Europe than in America, whose relations with foreign states are less and less simple, but what you say on this subject too will find a sympathetic echo among the friends of freedom and peace."
"Then, it is clear, I heard a call from the voice: ""Brothers! The dike is breaking! The river is coming! Plug your arms, brothers; with the dike of our bodies, we will save our house! Sisters, behind us, connect your arms! Close the crevices, children! The river! And all this multitude, which I had seen quietly tread the grass and the leaves fallen with prosperous feet, came to hurry, their eyes are no longer fixed on the rich plain, but rose up in distress and challenge, looking at this precipitated darkness. And the voice called: ""Hasten, brothers! The dike is broken; the river is flooded! And they answered: ""Brother, we come!"" Thousands and thousands they pressed, shoulder to shoulder, men, women and children, and the beasts lying behind, until the formation of the living dike."
"In those times, there is a fear weighing on the heart and brain — the thought that after all the unimaginable suffering, waste and sacrifice of this war, nothing can come of it, no real relief, no permanent advantage for Europe, no improvement for the future of humanity. Publicists' statements — 'It must never happen again', 'The conditions for lasting peace must be guaranteed', 'The United States of Europe must be founded', 'Militarism must cease' — are all the natural consequences of this fear. These are admirable proclamations in feeling and intention. But human nature being what it has been and is likely to remain, we must face the possibility that nothing comes from the war, except the restoration of Belgium, (which, at least, is certain;) certain alterations of the borders; a long period of economic and social unrest more bitter than before; an overwhelming moral reaction after too much effort."
"Second, the Emperor is an extremely intelligent and highly educated man. His mental processes are fast, but they also go very deep. He is a researcher in research, and questions and listens more than he speaks. His knowledge base is immense and sometimes amazing. He manifests interest in everything, even for the slightest detail, which can have an impact on human improvement. I remember half an hour of conversation with him on a glass of cup, which he had obtained from a excavation in the Roman ruin called Saalburg, near Homburg. He always seemed to me the most deeply concerned about the arts of peace. I never heard him talk much about war, and then always with horror, nor many military questions, but the improvement of agriculture, invention and manufacturing, and especially trade and education in all their ramifications, were the main subjects of his thought and conversation."
"On 19 April 1839, Belgium and the Netherlands, which, from 1815 to 1830, had formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, signed a treaty of separation and independence between each other. It is in this treaty that the initial commitment of Belgian neutrality is found. The clause of the treaty reads as follows: ""Belgium, within the limits described above, will form an independent neutral State and will be bound to observe the same neutrality towards all other States."" On the same day and in the same place (London), a treaty, known in the history of diplomacy as the Treaty of Quintuple, was signed by Great Britain, France, Prussia, Austria and Russia, approving and adopting the treaty between Belgium and the Netherlands. Later, on 11 May, the German Confederation, of which Austria and Prussia were members, also ratified this treaty."
"Médéa, seeing that he did not know the fear, gave him a magical ointment that would give him the strength of seven men and protect him from fire and steel. All the people gathered at the sunrise in the field of Ares. When the fiery bulls saw Jason standing in the middle of the field furiously pulled out of their eyes. Fierce was their appearance and the crowd waited without breath to see what the end would be. As the bulls came with heads lowered and tails in the air, Jason jumped on one side, and the monsters shot him with chamfers that shook the earth. They turned around and Jason stood for the jump."
"Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental to him while they were eating their supper on the lunar veranda; and Anne, to punish him, was gracious to Charlie Sloane and allowed him to go home. However, this revenge did no harm to anyone as much as anyone who tried to infuse him. Gilbert took a skilful walk with Ruby Gillis, and Anne could hear them laughing and talking cheerfully while they were walking in the calm and crisping autumn air. They obviously had the best of the good moments, while she was horribly bored by Charlie Sloane, who was talking uninterruptedly, and never, even by chance, said something worth listening to. Anne gave a moment absent ""yes"" or ""no"", and thought like Ruby had looked at that night, as Charlie's eyes were very spoiled in the moonlight — worse than by the day — and that the world, in a way more beautiful way than she had thought before, was."
"The Government of the United States and the German Imperial Government have long fought for the same great object, have met to insist on the very principles that the Government of the United States today solemnly insists on: they are both fighting for the freedom of the seas; the United States Government will continue to defend this freedom, regardless of the quarter violated, without compromise and at all costs; and it calls for the practical cooperation of the German Imperial Government at a time when cooperation can most and when this great common object is the most remarkable and the most effective achievement; the German Imperial Government expresses the hope that this object can be achieved to some extent even before the end of the present war."
"As it was known that the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were still at large in Pacific waters, it was decided not to go directly to Samoa, but to form a direct course for New Caledonia. For the next fifteen, we were playing a game of hiding and searching in the large island playground of the Pacific Ocean. On the first evening, the psyche reported ""where Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were still unknown; ships to turn off all the lights and proceed with only lights shaded in the arch and back."" Military books and papers were quickly collected, and the remaining few minutes of the day were used to lie down, while the difficult task allowed us to try to sleep the clock round."
"The world was then in formation. Did a new Europe, a new society, a new humanity, take shape in the prodigious shock by which our imagination is confused? We can at least seek to understand what we cannot hinder. This war was not a question of blind destiny, but had been planned for a long time. What are the forces that have set the nations in motion? I do not seek to establish responsibility. No matter who it can, those who have let the conflict lose behind them have people of a spirit. This is perhaps the most surprising thing at a time when economic, social and moral interests are so intertwined from one end of the earth to the other that the conqueror himself must suffer cruelly from the ruin of the conquered. The governments have determined the day and the hour. They could not have done so in opposition to the manifest will of the nations."
"But I have come here to call for the help of the men of Liverpool and the surrounding districts. The situation is serious. This is as serious a situation as this country has never been confronted. You do not need to have a particular knowledge to verify that you yourself. A careful and intelligent reading of the dispatches published in the newspapers has had to lead you to the conclusion that this country engages one of the most formidable enemies against whom it has ever waged war. The problems are great, the perils are great, and nothing can make us pass through the united effort of all men in the British Empire. If you look at what our brave people are doing on the front line you can see the perils there, the trials, the privations, and they do it without flapping. [""Listen, listen!""] Never in the history of this country our men have shown more courage and endurance than they have had during this war. They have done everything you can expect of the mortal man."
"The landscape had appeared arid at first, because the translation of the recent agony in freedom from pain had been so numb in its speed that it was some time before it could fully appreciate the pleasant dogland through which it passed. There were woods with leaves on the ground through which scurry, long grassy slopes for long tracks, and lakes in which it could dive for the sticks and bring them back to — but he did not finish his thought, for the boy was not with him. A small wave of house sickness possessed him. He made his mind easier to see away a large door as high as the heavens, wide enough for all. He understood that only man had built such barriers and by pushing his eyes that he could discern the humans who passed beyond. He broke in a race that he could gain more quickly this enclosure made beautiful by men and women; but his thoughts exceeded his rhythm, and he remembered that he had left the family behind, and yet was not the perfect one."
"Nearly five months have passed since the invasion of Belgium and France by the German army. These 140 days have been filled with thrilling and decisive events. While from their sure advantage the American people have examined the scene, an old regime has literally collapsed before our eyes. Europe is a profession on which the demiurgical forces of the earth like Frederick the Great, Bismarck and Napoleon once weave the texture of European civilization. Today, the demon of war, with a hot knife, eroded texture, and a modern Czar and Kaiser, King and President, with the generals and Admirals, weave the war and the misfortune of a new world. Hundred years ago, the forces that caused wars were political forces; today, the collision between nations was born from economic interests."
"The library of the University of Leuven had 500 manuscripts, about 800 incunabula, and 250,000 to 300,000 volumes. In particular, the original of the university's founding bull was noted in 1425, an example of the famous work of André Vesale, De Humani Corporis Fabrica, an example given to the university by Charles V., a precious manuscript by Thomas in Kempis. There were numerous bibliographic curiosities; the collection of old Flemish bindings of the 16th and 17th centuries contained some curious specimens. The memories of the former university, seals, diplomas, medals, etc., were preciously preserved in the cases. The old 16th century prints formed an extremely rare treasure; all the pieces, brochures and placards on the reform of the Netherlands were kept in a ""varia"" volume, thus constituting a unique ensemble."
"Warsaw, December 5 (by Courier in Petrograd.) — I have already phoned you from the German force that was advancing around Lodz and was cut off to the south and east of the city. These were two corps of soldiers, the twenty-fifth body and the third guard corps. The isolated force turned north and tried to cut its way through the small town of Brezizny. It was in Brezizny that the final disaster overtaken them. The city and the road are in a hollow in the middle of the wooded country, where the Germans were pressed from the Vistula and pressed back."
"To see him, our legendary and wonderful French basilica, to bid him farewell, before his fall and irremediable erosion, I had made a detour of two hours upon my return from a service mission. The morning of October was foggy and cold. The hills of Champagne were deserted that day; with their vines of dark brown leaves, wet of rain, they all seemed clothed in a kind of shiny leather. We had also passed through a forest, keeping our eyes vigilant, our weapons ready, for the possibility of marauding Uhlans. And finally we had perceived the immense form of a church, far in the mist, rising in all its great height above the plots of reddish squares, which must be the roofs of houses; it was obviously it. The entrance to Reims: defenses of all kinds, stone barriers, trenches, piqué fences, sentinels with cross bayonets."
"First of all, that any change that will take place will not affect the functions of the head of government or the secretary for foreign affairs, but that it will continue to be maintained as it is now. The third and final point, not only for my friends behind me, but also for the opposition, is undoubtedly the following: any reconstruction that could be made will only be used for war, and will not be taken in any neighbourhood to indicate anything in the nature of surrender or compromise on the part of a person or body of persons of their various political goals and ideals, that is to say, to the extent that I can go at this moment. Nothing definitive has yet taken place. When and if such an arrangement should become a fait accompli, the House will have the greatest opportunity to express itself, if it so desires, on itself."
"These are facts that speak for themselves and show the urgent need, not only for a loan, but for a national loan – a much larger loan in its scale, much larger in its base, and much more compelling in its demands to every class and sector of the community than in our history. For the first time in our financial experience, no limit was imposed on the amount to be raised; and this means that every citizen of the country is invited to subscribe as much as he can to help us achieve a complete and rapid victory. I do not need to be attributed from the point of view of the simple investor. Indeed, the only criticism I have heard in the House of Commons or outside is that it is perhaps a little too generous in its terms. It is a mistake, if it is a mistake, on the right hand side."
"We have known you for a long time. We have known you since we, Russians, came to a communion with Western Europe and we have started to draw from the great spiritual treasure created by our brothers from Western Europe. From generation to generation, we have looked carefully at the life of England, and we have kept in our minds and hearts all that is brilliant, particular and individual, which has been impressed by the English word, English thought and English life. We have always been surprised by the extent and multiplicity of the English soul, in which we find, side by side, Milton and Swift, Scott and Shelley, Shakespeare and Byron. We have always been surprised by the incessant and growing power of civic life in England; we have always known that the English people were the first among the peoples of the world to enter a struggle for civic rights, and that nowhere does the word freedom sound so proud and triumphant as to do it in England."
"In recent years, we have assured Germany that no aggression against it would receive our support. We have refused it one thing — we would not give an unconditional promise to stay away from Germany, regardless of the aggression of Germany itself to its neighbours. Last July, before the outbreak of the war, France was ready to accept a conference; Italy was ready to accept a conference; Russia was ready to accept a conference; and we now know that, after the British proposal for a conference, the Russian emperor himself proposed that the dispute be returned to The Hague. Germany refused to accept any suggestion to settle the dispute in this way."
"All this I knew in England, but I knew it from the reports of others. I could not, I could not, know what was the misery, the desolation of Belgium, what the imperative needs of this people were, until I arrived in the Netherlands and at the borders of the Belgian territory. Inside this territory, I could not pass because I was British, but there I could see German soldiers, the Landwehrs, guarding what they call their new German province. Belgium a German province! There, in Maastricht, I saw fugitives crossing the border in Holland with all their worldly goods on their shoulders or in their hands, or without anything at all, seeking the hospitality of a small country that feels, although it is neutral, the painful stress and the cost of the war. There, at the border, I was standing between Dutch and German soldiers, so close to the Germans that I could almost touch them, so close to three German officers that their conversation with greetings reached my ears."
"Well, gentlemen, this war opened the eyes of some of us, and confirmed the fears of others. Not one of us wanted to fight. Our hand was forced, so that we could not abstain without national and personal dishonour. Now, I do not think it is yet realized that Germany's methods in trade have been, and are, as far as possible, identical with its methods in the war. Let me rub in. As long as 1903, at a meeting of the Chemical Industry Society, under the chairmanship of your compatriot, Mr Levinstein, I pointed out that under the German state there was a commercial council, whose purpose was to secure and keep trade for Germany. This council had practical control of functions, bonuses, and goods; its members were representative of the various commercial interests of the empire; and they acted, as a general rule, without control of the Reichstag. You can read what I said to you, if you think, in the Journal of the Chemical Industry Society for 1903."
"The work that had to be done to obtain, in a relatively short time, such a large number of witness statements scattered throughout the United Kingdom, made it necessary for a large number of examiners to be employed; the testimony was, in all cases, taken by men of legal science and experience, although, of course, they did not have the power to administer an oath; they were instructed not to ""lead"" witnesses or make suggestions to them, and also to impress the need for diligence and precision in the presentation of their testimony; they were also responsible for dealing with the evidence critically, and as far as possible to satisfy themselves, by asking questions that arose from the evidence, that the witnesses were telling the truth; they were, in fact, cross-examine them, as the testimony provided provided elements of cross-examination; we saw and conversed with many of these gentlemen, and we were greatly impressed by their ability and by what we gathered in terms of fairness of the mind that they were scrupulously instructed to do."
"The birds are sometimes able to discriminate between protectors and persecutors, but rarely very well I should imagine; they do not see the face only, but the whole shape, and our frequent change of dress must make it difficult for them to distinguish the individuals they know and to trust strangers. Even a dog is sometimes at fault when his master, seen for the last time in black and grey suit, reappears in the straw hat and the flannels. Nevertheless, if the birds once come to know those who usually protect them and form a confident habit, it will not be abandoned because of a small difficult treatment on occasion. A lady in Worthing told me of her black birds that breed in her garden that they refused to be kept strawberries when she hit the ripening fruits. One or more of the birds would always succeed in getting under the net; and when she would capture the thief and carry him, shouting, wrestling and stinging at his fingers, until the end of the garden and releasing him, he would immediately follow her to bed and set herself in fruit again."
"With regard to the censorship of letters, Germany, as well as Great Britain, continued this course with regard to private letters falling into their hands. The undisputed right to adopt such a measure made him untimely objections. It was claimed that the American mail on board the Dutch vapors had been destroyed on numerous occasions. No evidence to that effect had been filed with the government, and therefore no representation had been made. Until such a case was presented in concrete form, this government would not be justified in bringing the matter before the belligerent."
"Under the terms of the Triple Alliance, each member of the Alliance is required to communicate immediately to the other members all international diplomatic transactions concerning the alliance. Germany and Austria failed to do so during the first stages of July, when they were preparing for the war. It was only after putting on their train so surely that an explosion was almost inevitable that they communicated the documents to Italy and called on it to take its place on the ground with them. But Italy refused; because after examining the evidence, it concluded that Germany and Austria were the aggressors. Now, the terms of the Triple Alliance bind its members to stand together only in the event of an attack."
"It warms my heart to give me such a reception, but it is not me that I want to think of tonight, but of those who have just become citizens of the United States. It is the only country in the world that is experiencing this constant and repeated rebirth. Other countries depend on the multiplication of their own natives. This country constantly drinks with the strength of new sources by voluntary association with it of great bodies of strong men and women looking to the future. And so by the gift of the free will of the independent people, it is constantly renewed from generation to generation by the same process by which it was originally created. It is as if humanity had decided to ensure that this great nation, founded for the benefit of humanity, does not lack for the allegiance of the peoples of the world."
"When I think of the flag that these ships carry, the only touch of colour about them, the only thing that moves as if it had a stable spirit in it, in their solid structure, it seems to me that I see alternating bands of parchment on which are written the rights of freedom and justice and blood strips peeled to justify these rights, and then, in the corner, a prediction of the blue serenity in which each nation can swim that represents these great things. America's mission is the only thing that a sailor or soldier should think about; it has nothing to do with the formulation of its policy; it is to support its policy, whatever it may be — but it is to support its policy in the spirit of itself, and the strength of our policy is that we, which, for the moment, administer the affairs of this nation, are not at the origin of its mind; we try to embody it; we try to achieve it in action, we do not dictate it."
"First of all, this Government has not, at any time and in any way, assigned any of its rights of neutrality to one of the current belligerents; it has, of course, recognized the right of access and search and the right to apply the rules of war smuggling to commercial items; it has insisted on the use of the visit and search as an absolutely necessary guarantee against the diversion of neutral ships for ships belonging to any enemy and against the diversion of legal cargoes for illegal goods; it has also admitted the right of blockade so effectively exercised and effectively maintained; these are only the well-known limitations that the war imposes on neutral trade on the high seas; but nothing beyond has been admitted; I call your Excellency's attention to this point, although it is already known throughout the world following the publication of our correspondence on these issues with several of the belligerent nations, because I cannot assume that you have official knowledge of it."
"It was just at the dawn of a morning in March that I descended from a train in Gerbéviller, the little ""Martyr City"" who hides her desolation because she hid her existence in the foothills of the Vosges. There was a dense fog. At 6 a.m., fog usually covers the valleys of the Meurthe and the Moselle. From the station I could only see a building on the other side of the road. A gendarme demanded my credentials. I handed her the pass of the headquarters of the ""Première Armée française"", which controls everything going and coming, any activity in this area. The gendarme demanded to know the time when I proposed to leave. I told him that it would be necessary to have the permit ""visited for departure"" at the headquarters of the gendarmerie."
"For several weeks before, I had heard a story about what was left of Parisian life, namely that if one wanted a regular chill to the old one, he really had to go to the Opéra Comique one day when Miss Chenal closed the show by singing the French national anthem. I had been told that there would be difficulties in sitting. I was rather skeptical. I also considered that I had had had enough chills since the beginning of the war, both old fashion and new. I also thought that I had already heard the song of the ""Marseillaise"" sung in the best possible circumstances to produce chills. One of the first nights after the mobilization, 10,000 French people filled the street under the windows of the New York Times, where I was at work."
"All members of the Cabinet remain silent about what would follow the action of the House. Former ministers and other prominent men in public affairs say, however, that the action of Parliament was practically a declaration of war. When the House gathered this afternoon after its long break, there were 482 MPs out of 500, the absences remaining because of the illness. MPs were particularly applauded those who were wearing military uniforms and who had requested permission to leave their military duties to be present at the sitting. All the Tribunes were full of overflows. No representative of Germany, Austria, or Turkey were to be seen in the diplomatic gallery. The first envoy to arrive was Thomas Nelson Page, the American ambassador, who was accompanied by his staff. Mr. Barrère, Sir J. Bennell Rodd, and Michel de Giers, the French, British and Russian ambassadors, respectively, appeared a few minutes later, and all were greeted with applause, which was shared by the Belgian, Greek and Romanian ministers. George B. McClellan, former mayor of New York, occupied a seat."
"In 1906, the Democratic Party, which took over the wreck of Parker's defeat, aspired to come together. ""Big business"", assaulted and bruised and struck by President Roosevelt, is ready to win. Roosevelt or his candidate can only be defeated in 1908 by democratic harmony. Bryan was abroad, traveling, and in some way his distant figure seemed less dreadful than the close figure of the White House. The East did not ask him to reverse his radicalism, but only not to talk about it. He arrived in New York, and the business went to hear him make a speech of harmony. If he did, the business would support him for the President. He made the speech; he declared for the government the ownership of the railways."
"Tuesday, 8 p.m., August 18. -- Orders were given to us that there would be no more lights after nightfall, so I need to write this. We had a big departure on Sackville Street on our bus, and we boarded about 2 hours. From that time until 7 a.m., we looked at the boarding in progress, on our own ship and another. We have a lot of R.E. and R.F.A. and A.S.C., and a lot of horses and pontoons and ambulance carts: horses were very difficult to board, the poor dears. It was an exciting scene all the time. I don't remember anything as exciting as our departure from Ireland. All the 600 khaki men on board, and all the others on each ship, and all the crowds on the dock, and in the boats and on the lighthouses, agitated and screamed."
"We have heard that the German government has declared war on the English government. Here, our ""fitna"" against the English government is over. As the monsoon wind leads the sandhills of our coast to new forms, as well as this news of German criminals leads our hearts and spears to the service of the English government. Jubaland Somali are with the English government. Every day in our mosques we pray for the success of the English armies. Day is as night and night is as day with us until we hear that the English are victorious. God knows the right. He will help the law."
"As our reporter entered Sir James Barrie's hotel room by a door, the door next door closed slowly.""I was alone,"" wrote our reporter. ""I entered the hallway and I just had time to see him sink into the elevator. Then I understood what he meant when he said on the phone that he would be ready for me at 10:30."" I returned carefully to the room, where I was no longer alone. Sir James Barrie's man was there; a Stolide Londoner, Brown's name, who told me he was visiting America for the first time."" Sir James is sorry, but he called me,"" assured me without moving muscle. ""But it's the pipe,"" and he put a pipe of the greatest size on the table. ""The pipe he smokes?"" I asked him. Brown is obviously a very sincere man, because he hesitated. ""It's the pipe,"" explained the interview."
"A few days ago, I sat down at the bedside of a wounded, reservist sapor, and I heard the story of life in a box of signals on a branch in the north of England. The man was dying. I think he knew it. But the zest of his daily life was still strong in him. He described how, when he left the army at the beginning, he got his post on the railway. He told me that there were three trains every day, and mentioned that the winter nights the last train was often very late. It meant a late dinner, but his wife saw it all warm. Sometimes his wife came to the box to meet him if it was a dry night. In the next bed there was a young Scots from a Highland neighborhood that I know very well."
"The night is a period of continuous tension. The sentries join in the darkness, imagining each bush to be a close enemy. Far trees seem to change their position; bouquets of grass, really close enough, seem to be men passing through the sky. One man questions another; the section commander is called. He in turn explains his fears to an officer. Only one blow is ordered to the suspicious object, and no noise is heard. The night continues therefore. When we were new to the game, only one blow was enough to alarm the whole line, and thousands of bullets were fired into the darkness. Now we know better. So, the enemy too. And it was satisfying to see that not all our ammunition had been wasted, for a patrol recently discovered more than a hundred Germans died in a wood in front of us. Ammunition had not been wasted that time. But, oh, what a wasted war!"
"The fierce hatred of England in Germany is to a large extent due to what the Germans call the ""war of the traders"" of the English. They argue that the English confiscation of German patents is a totally unjust method of struggle, and it has provoked the deepest resentment. When asked about the future, they answer that they will do everything at the right time. After Belgium will come France, then the tour of England will arrive. They are not discouraged by the inability to reach Paris, since the strategy adopted by the French would have made the possession of Paris of little value. It will still be taken. As far as England is concerned, we do not talk much about an invasion army, but German confidence is clearly placed in its Zeppelins, many of which are built at all speed. They must be employed against England, whose share in the war is the least honorable of all."
"Last night was the first in ten days that I had a roof on my head. The weather was atrocious — the rain and driving, the snowcut — but it did not cross my top, which is richly covered in mud. We had about fifteen fights and now we came back from the line of fire for a short rest to be restored. This meant two days of walking through the roads and fields of the deep ankle in the collage, porrid mud, but we were all quite happy to endure all the difficulties as long as we came out of the pressure of flying shells and bullets. In the trenches we lost some of our men, but not much. I just wish you could see our battalion now; what a change of the crowd that was walking in London. Every man, almost, has a beard, and you couldn't imagine the dirty and dredged crowd that we are. The pressure to look through the night in the trenches is pretty horrible."
"I don't think there's a living man who, in the first interview of an 11-inch sheller, isn't pink with funk. After the first ten, we get used to them, but really, they are terrible! They hit a house. You can see the big shell — a black striations — just before it hits, so, before you hear the explosion, the whole house just rises up in the air, apparently quite silently; then you hear the roaring, and all the earth trembles. In the place where the house was there is a huge fountain of what looks like pink flakes. It's the sprayed brick. Then a monstrous catch of black smoke rises on about a hundred feet or more, and finally there's a curious formation of willow, and then - you duck, like huge pieces of shell, and of the house, and of the earth, and the hay fell on your head."
"The Russians make heavy sacrifices for the war, but in these historic days we must accelerate our energies even more, we must double and triple our sacrifices. Let us not forget that despite all our sacrifices, despite all our sadness and our concern, we are not deprived of peaceful work, we have not been dragged into destruction as the Polish people have been. Without any further delay we must hurry to their help. Widely organized social assistance must be provided to those who flee. We must provide them with shelter and food. These victims flow into the central provinces of Russia, in Moscow, and they must be assisted until they are able to return to their country. It is necessary to determine the degree of their distress and to help them support the necessities of life in places already rid of the enemy by the aggressiveness of the Russian army."
"If the Bulgarian government had left prejudices on one side and looked clearly at the events, they would not have been slow to understand that from the moment when England entered the war and Italy abandoned its allies, the Austro-German alliance had lost the game politically. Every day that passes increasingly diminishes the hopes of success of the Dual Alliance, and allows England and Russia to expand their inexhaustible forces. It is not difficult to foresee from now on the conditions of peace that England and Russia will impose."
"Yesterday, we had one man killed and two wounded, the first victims for more than a week. The story of one of the wounded is worth showing you the handful of these men. He told me that he noticed new digging work on the side of the enemy in front of his firing station. We can see the spadefuls of the earth coming from the basement when new trenches are dug. Although it was in broad daylight, our man thought he would go see what the Germans were going to do, so he jumps on the side of his trench and runs forward thirty yards towards a ditch and crawls along about a hundred meters. He then finds a large shell hole in the field on one side of the ditch, so he doubles and leaves and has a good look around."
"It was the first days of the late '80s, when Alec MacDonald was far from reaching the national fame that he had now attained. He was a young but trustworthy of the detective force, who had distinguished himself in several cases entrusted to him. His great bone figure promised an exceptional physical strength, while his great skull and his deep and chandelier eyes did not speak less clearly of the vivid intelligence that shimmers behind his bushing eyebrows. He was a silent man, precise with a dur nature and a hard aberdonian accent. Twice in his career, Holmes had helped him achieve success, his only reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. That is why the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague was profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in all difficulty."
"On the evening of 25 September, the railway and telegraph lines were destroyed on the Lovenjoul-Vertryck line. Therefore, the two above-mentioned places on the morning of 30 September had to give an account and provide hostages. In the future, communities near a place where such things occur (whether they are complicit or not) will be punished without pity. To this end, hostages were taken from all places near the railway lines threatened by such attacks, and at the first attempt to destroy the railways or telegraphs or telephone lines, they will be immediately shot down."
"You remember very well that on 16 (29) July, when the war was declared by Austria and Hungary, I came here and told you that the government's decision was to maintain strict neutrality. One day before the end of the supplementary session of Parliament, I repeated the government's statements, that no matter what kind of political combinations were formed around us, the government is determined to maintain absolute neutrality until the end. It was with pleasure that I heard the assurances of all party leaders at that time that if I kept this attitude, they would help me maintain Bulgaria's absolute neutrality."
"Men do not make laws, but they discover them. Laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority. They must be based on the eternal foundation of justice. This state is the luckiest in its form of government that has the instruments for the discovery of laws. The last, the most modern, and the closest perfect system that the staff has designed is a representative government. Its weakness is the weakness of us being imperfect human beings who administer it. Its strength is that even such administration assures the people more blessings than any other system ever produced. No nation has ruled out it and retained freedom. Representative government must be preserved. The courts are established, not to determine the popularity of a case, but to judge and enforce rights. No litigator should be required to submit his case to the risk and expense of a political campaign. No judge should be required to seek or receive political rewards. The Massachusetts courts are known and honoured where men love justice."
"Whole villages have been destroyed by bombardments or fires; cities once full of life are no longer but deserts filled with ruins; and, visiting the scenes of desolation where the torch of the invader has done his work, one constantly feels as if one were walking among the remains of one of those cities of antiquities that have been destroyed by the great cataclysms of nature. In truth, one can say that never a war has continued between civilized nations has taken on the savage and ferocious character of that which, at this moment, is being carried out on our soil by an implacable adversary. Pillage, rape, fire and murder are the common practice of our enemies; and the facts that have been revealed to us day after day constitute definitive crimes against common rights, punished by the codes of each country with the most severe and dishonorous penalties, and which reveal an astonishing degeneration in German habits of thought since 1870."
"The information received from our fleet now in the Black Sea is as follows: According to accounts of Russian sailors taken prisoner and the presence of a miner among the Russian fleet, it is proved that the Russian fleet intended to close the entrance of the Bosphorus with mines and completely destroy the Ottoman imperial fleet after having divided it into two. Our fleet, believing that it was facing an unexpected attack, and assuming that the Russians had started hostilities without an official declaration of war, continued the dispersed Russian fleet, bombed the port of Sevastopol, destroyed in the city of Novorosiysk fifty oil depots, fourteen military transports, some attices, and the wireless telegraph station. In addition to the above, our fleet sank in Odessa one Russian cruiser and seriously damaged another. It is believed that this second boat was also sank."
"Indeed, in January 1913, I wrote a warning which now reads as a summary of the events that have occurred since. I was denounced as a senile alarmist by some who are now the strongest in calling to arms. Alas! too late is their repentance. May I ask why our eminent academicians and scholars who still profess ""friendship and admiration"" for their German confreres never suspected the immense conspiracy whose civilization was the victim? Why did they accept the stars and crosses of Caligula-Attila? Why did they remain with the docile creatures of his chancellery, and spread to them and abroad the worship of Geist and Kultur? Are they able to instruct us about politics, public law, and international relations, when they were so dishonest, so blind, so frightened, as to deal with the catastrophe most borne in the memory of living men?"
"The next morning, the Minister of Romania brought to the palace a letter from the insurgents addressed to the representatives of the authorities announcing that the patience of the insurgents was exhausted, and that they were determined to enter by any means whatsoever into Durazzo. An identical letter was sent to the inhabitants of the city. It was then that the Prince decided to abandon Durazzo. The ministers, having received the message of the insurgents and having been informed of the Prince's intention to leave the place, met again in the palace to find a way of settling the worrying financial problem. At the same time the International Commission of Control decided to call the camp of the insurgents in Shiak (outside Durazzo), to give them news of the imminent departure of the Prince, and to invite them to the city."
"In the long list of new Russian taxes, the income tax is the most interesting. It is still only a bill. The government is reluctant to do so. Perhaps the Duma will take steps to make this bill a law. Its main provisions are as follows: All annual revenues of 1,000 rubles ($500) and more must be assessed at a progressive rate ranging from 1 1/2 per cent out of 1,000 rubles to a maximum of 8 per cent on revenues of 200,000 rubles ($100,000) and more. All persons actively engaged in the current war will be exempt from this tax. All persons released from military service in the past four years must pay an additional tax equal to 50 per cent of their income tax, provided that the income of the parents whose sons were released reaches 2,000 rubles ($1,000). All persons released from military service with an income of less than 1,000 rubles ($500) must pay a uniform tax of 6 rubles ($3). A special war tax must be levied in provinces where the entire population or certain groups of the population are released."
"A delegation from the Moscow Merchant Association, composed of Messrs. N.N. Shustov, I.G. Volkov, and A.D. Liamin, will soon travel to Petrograd to ask the Ministers of Finance, Trade and Industry and the Interior to take action against German ""oppression"". The delegation intends to request the revocation of all privileges (franchises) and patents granted to Austrian, German and Turkish subjects and the granting to Moscow merchants of the right to admit foreigners to the Merchant Association in its sole discretion. Finally, the delegation intends to discuss with the Ministers the special fund recently established at the State Bank for the settlement of payments to foreign merchants belonging to warring nations."
"Of the 502 plants employing 46,586 employees, it was necessary to shut down completely, while 1,034 establishments with 435,000 employees reduced their labour force to 319,000. Thus, about one third of the total industrial labour force suffered the effects of the war, either through the total liberation or the reduction of production.The lack of skilled labour and the lack of funds affected 222 establishments with 58,000 workers.The lack of funds was very serious in the Baltic provinces (especially in the chemical industry) affecting fourteen establishments with 15,701 workers.A total of 132 establishments with 50,000 employees reduced their activities, and of those 30 per cent with 15,000 workers in the chemical industry.In addition, 20 establishments in the metallurgical industry (fine machinery) with 11,000 employees had to reduce their business volume.In other industries, the lack of labour supply was not felt."
"The concessions offered by Count Tisza, the Hungarian Prime Minister, in the hope of avoiding the coming storm, do not make any impression on Romanians either inside or outside the monarchy. He promises to allow Romania's teaching in schools, the use of language in public services and the increase of Romanian representation in the Hungarian Parliament. But the time for concessions has passed. The Austrian advance towards Serbia threatens to cut Romania from south and west of Europe and to prevent the arrival of large stores and medicines ordered there from the United States. It is obvious that neither Romania nor Bulgaria can maintain their current attitudes for a long time. It remains to the powers of the Agreement to devise a means of ensuring cooperation between the two States. Serbia recently asked Bucharest whether Romania would oppose territorial concessions to a neighbouring State, obviously indicating Bulgaria. Romania replied that it would be happy to see all the disputes between its neighbours arranged."
"I walked one day to Antwerp, along the horrific road that he had travelled by Contich and Waerloos to Waelhem. Every day, the German shells fell closer to the city, so that every time we went out at the place he had visited yesterday, it was likely that he would find himself badly surprised. One day, I found myself, (I would not have been there if I had known it,) perhaps a kilometre inside the range of the enemy's cannons. A Red Cross car had dropped me and picked up wounded men instead, and there was nothing else for her but to walk along the road. Along the road of the most important trenches, I came a dozen Belgian soldiers, simply raised after twenty-four hours of what is difficult to describe other than a hell."
"The Italian occupation of the rocky and desolate island of Saseno, which, from a strategic point of view, completely dominates the approaches of the sea to Avlona, is a logical consequence of the occupation of this city with the aim of establishing a hospital and maintaining order. The island itself was for a few months in 1913 and 1914 a bone of dispute between the Italians, who insisted on obtaining it for the Principality of Albania, and the Greeks, who were equally eager to keep it in their possession. With Saseno under the control of a foreign power, the possessor of Avlona could never make the city a place of arms. Saseno, like one of the Ionian Islands, became a British protectorate under the Treaty of Paris of 5 November 1815, but was given to Greece by the Treaty of London of 29 March 1864."
"The departure of the French soldiers who were mobilized in Bucharest was the occasion of expressions of sympathy towards France. Among the population and in the streets, there was not a single voice that was not cordially and enthusiastically for the Triple Accord in general and France in particular. Some characters, such as the pilot general who, in 1870, fought on the side of France, and some newspaper writers who, following national aspirations, have continued a violent campaign against Austria since the first day of the war, are enthusiastic by the public in the cafes and by the majority of the army officers who attended these scenes in uniform."
"The Romanian Government's semi-official documents issued the following statement on the Bucharest Treaty: Romania's view on the Bucharest Treaty, and its link to the European War, was discussed and established in a Crown Council held on 21 July (August 3, N.S.) In the Bucharest Treaty, Romanian interest was not linked to fixed border lines, unless they guaranteed a necessary balance for Romania. Romania was not obliged to protect this balance in its real form longer than in its mind that could be maintained. If the European war, in its future consequences, were to make certain changes to the real borders of either of the Balkan States, Romania's interest requires that the Balkan balance be established in accordance with the changes made to correspond to the objective of maintaining the real balance in its new form, regardless of the scope of these border lines in their final restoration."
"The Poles are forced by the need to fight in the Prussian, Austrian and Russian armies against each other. This is not the slightest attempt of emancipation that has been made either in Prussian Posen or in the Russian ""Kingdom"" or in Austrian Galicia. One could even say that the dismemberment goes deeper than ever, as is the case today for the spirits. The only indication of a future union is the manifesto of the Grand Duke Nikolai, the Russian Marshal of Field, to the Poles, issued in mid-August. It began: ""Poles, the hour has struck in which the holy dream of your fathers and your grandfathers can be fulfilled. Let the borders cutting under the Polish people be erased; let them unite under the scepter of the Tsar. Under this scepter Poland will regenerate, free in religion, language and autonomy."""
"A Militarist is a person who believes that all the real power is the power to kill, and that Providence is on the side of the great battalions. The most famous Militarist at the moment, thanks to the zeal with which we bought and quoted his book, is General Friedrich von Bernhardi. But we cannot allow the General to take over the primacy of our own writers as an activist propagandist. I am old enough to remember the beginning of the anti-German phase of this very old propaganda in England. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 has taken a great back to Europe. Until now, no one was afraid of Prussia, although everyone had been a little afraid of France; and we kept ""buffer states"" between us and Russia to the east. Germany had indeed defeated Denmark; but then Denmark was a small state, and was abandoned at his hour of need by those who should have helped him, to the great indignation of Ibsen."
"For those who love peace, there can be no other hope in the present conflict than defeat, the total discredit of the German legend, the end for the good and all the superstition of blood and iron, of the teutonic kiplingism, and all the criminal efficiency that lies in Berlin. Never has the war been as fair as the war against Germany today. Never has any state in the world called for so much punishment. But we must remember that Europe's quarrel is with the German state, not with the German people; with a system, not with a race. Germany's ancient tradition is a pacifist and civilized tradition. The temperament of the mass of the German people is kind, healthy and kind. Catastrophe to the German army, if it is not accompanied by such a memorable evil as the unbearable dismemberment or indignation, will mean the restoration of the greatest peoples of Europe to the communion of Western nations."
"Monsignor: The time has come to combine efforts to stimulate and organize public opinion and public effort in the greatest conflict our people have ever faced. No one can contribute to this extremely urgent task. I propose, as a first step, that meetings be held without delay, not only in our major population and industry centres, but in all districts, urban and rural, throughout the United Kingdom, where the justice of our cause must be made clear, and that everyone's duty to do his or her part be respected. I venture to suggest to your lords that the four main cities you preside respectively should lead the way. I am prepared, to the extent that the demands of public duty permit, to provide the help that I can, and I would be happy, with this objective, to address my colleagues in your cities. I have reason to know that I can count on the cooperation of the leaders of each section of organized political opinion."
"Life during that time, I had a lot of things by my side in the person of my brother Wilky, who, as I had the opportunity to say elsewhere, managed in those years to live, or to have any appearance of it, with an immediateness that left me far away in the lurch. I always wondered how, while he had solved the question simply ambulando, which was for him, but by the gentlest sociable walk. This represented for me success — a kind of success, but a kind of assurance — to a extent that was my despair; and I never forgot how, that summer, when Dr. Herr looked in, decided a little to have the brilliant page out with us, the part of Wilky of the hour taken on the spot the form of his turn at once on our visitor the tables of the serious investigation."
"What human insight and power could do to arm a people against the last extremities has been done with your patriotic help. The hostility that has taken hold for a long time in the East and West has now been inflamed. The current situation has not been the result of transitional conflicts of interest or diplomatic entanglements, it is the result of a bad will that has been active for many years against the strength and prosperity of the German Empire. We are not motivated by the lust of conquest, we are inspired by the unwavering determination to keep for ourselves and for all future generations the place that God has given us."
"When finally our victorious fleets and armies come together, and the allied nations of the East and the West will begin to restore the well-being of several million ruined houses, France and Great Britain will make their great contribution of good will and wisdom, but your country will have something to bring that belongs to it. It is not only because of your value in war and your achievements in art, science and letters that we look forward to having you as allies and friends; it is for a certain quality in Russia itself, something deep and human, whose achievements are the result and expression. You, like us, have entered this war to defend a weak and threatened nation, which has trusted you, against the aggression without law of a strong military power; you, like us, have continued it as a war of self-defence and self-emancipation."
"On 22 August 1914, the General Commander of the Second Army, Mr. von Bülow, imposed on the City of Wavre a war levy of three million francs, to be paid before 1 September, in expiation of his unqualified behaviour (unlike the law of the nations and the customs of war) by making a surprise attack on the German troops. The General Commander of the Second Army has just given the General Commander this station of the Second Army the order to send without delay, this contribution which he should pay because of his conduct. I order you and order you to give the bearer of this letter the first two installments, that is, two million francs of gold. In addition, I demand that you give the bearer a letter, duly sealed with the seal of the city, stating that the balance, that is, one million francs, will be paid without fault, on 1 September."
"After her remarkable success as a news writer, Louisa M. Alcott was asked for a book. She first said that it was impossible, but the repeated requests of her publishers brought her the announcement that the only long story she could write would be about her own family. ""Small women"" resulted, and, by erecting this house of delight for young and old, Louisa Alcott built better than she knew. Her Jo was the inspiration of countless girls, and the multiplicity of facets of her character is indicated by the widely divergent lines of effort that Jo's example suggested to the girls readers of the story. In the case of the two writers, both of the early childhood found their inspiration in Jo. One, model after his idol, sought success in a career of scene, beginning to ""act"" in front of a mirror, with a kitchen deck for a train and a buttonhook for a dagger."
"After the death of Princess Charlotte, it was clearly important, for more than one reason, for the Duke of Kent to marry. From the point of view of the nation, the absence of heirs in the reigning family seemed to make the stage almost mandatory; it was also likely to be very opportune from the Duke's point of view. Marrying as a public duty, for the sake of the royal succession, would certainly deserve some recognition from a grateful country. When the Duke of York had married, he had received a settlement of L25,000 a year. Why should the Duke of Kent not expect an equal sum? But the situation was not quite simple. There was the Duke of Clarence to consider; he was the elder brother, and if he was married, he would clearly have the prior claim. On the other hand, if the Duke of Kent married, it was important to remember that he would make a serious sacrifice: a lady was involved."
"But the solidarity that you establish between German militarism and German culture, of which you and your colleagues claim to be representatives, is proof of the confusion of German conceptions. Presenting Goethe, Beethoven and Kant to the world you surround them with bayonets. In the same way, all traders and traders throughout Germany are accustomed to saying: ""I have four million bayonets behind me!"" Your Emperor told some traders who complained of bad business: ""I must travel!"" And he went to Constantinople; he went to Tangier, after the speech of Bremen. In each of his actions, he affirmed the subordination of economic civilization to military civilization. He considered it his duty to open the markets and assert the value of German products with cannon and sword. Hence his formidable armaments, his perpetual threats that held all nations in a state of constant anxiety. There is the deep and true cause of war. And it is entirely due to your Emperor and to his environment."
"But the question, why are we at war? can be quite well answered by anyone conversing with the facts of the European situation. We are not at war because the Emperor, as warlord, has sent a word to his legions to start a war of world aggression, carrying in his vortex intellectual Germany, despite all his peaceful aspirations. I can fairly claim to be a representative of this intellectual Germany that now comes for a good deal of sympathy, but I must possess this intellectual Germany, as far as I know about it, fully endorses the current policy of the Emperor. She does not approve it simply on the principle ""Law or false, my country""; she does so because she knows that war has become inevitable, and that we have to face this test when we are ready for it, not for the moment most pleasing to our enemies."
"An army that has preserved the absurd schritt of parade, a painful exercise for the spectator, because it feels that it makes fools of brave men, must have a tendency to return to older types. These Germans have been trained in peace and on the theory of books. In all this vast army, there is hardly any man who has stood at the wrong end of a loaded canon. They live in traditions of narrow formations, vast loads of cavalry, and other things that will not fit into the modern war. Braver men do not exist, but it is the bravery of men who have learned to lean on each other, not the cold, self-reliant and resourceful bravery of man who has learned to fight for his own hand. The British have had the teachings of two recent campaigns fought with modern weapons - that of Tirah and South Africa. Now that the reserves have reached the colors, there are few regiments who do not have a fair amount of war in their ranks."
"My children! My soldiers! No army in the history of the world has ever been honoured with a duty as sacred and as great as yours. By accomplishing it, show that you are the noble descendants of the Ottoman armies who, in the past, have made the world tremble, and that it is impossible for any enemy of our faith and our country to walk on our ground, and to disturb the peace of the sacred soil of Yemen, where is the inspirational tomb of our prophet. Undoubtedly prove to the enemies of the country that there is an Ottoman army and navy that can defend their faith, their country and their military honour, and how to defy death for their sovereign! Right and loyalty are on our side, hatred and tyranny on the side of our enemies, and therefore there is no doubt that the divine help and assistance of the just God and the moral support of our glorious Prophet will be on our side to encourage us."
"The German strategists are in search of a brief campaign, but they are wrong. Even with the capture of Petrograd, the war will not have begun, because Petrograd is only the border of Russia. Our troops are numerous and well equipped. The vastness of our country, its poor roads and its harsh climate are its defences. The French border is strongly fortified. A rapid capitulation is unthinkable, and there is no reason to surrender, because the war will continue until the bitter end. But a long campaign threatens Germany. It is a country with highly developed industry and with a huge foreign trade, whose break-up cannot be compensated by any territorial conquest. A war of Germany against England, France and Russia will stop its trade completely. It will be impossible for it to export its goods and import food."
"I have the honour to hand over to your Royal Highness the letter by which His Majesty the Emperor of Russia has deigned to accredit me by His Majesty the King of Serbia. My august master has instructed me to express to you the deep sympathy and sincere admiration that His Majesty feels for the valiant people of Serbia, his heroic army and his venerable leader. Allow me to express to your Highness the joy that I feel in the accomplishment of the imperial mission today when your army has covered itself with immortal glory and has written in Serbian history the most beautiful page that a people can desire. Separated by a long distance, but attracted by the heart of its older sister, Serbia can say that in this terrible struggle against an enemy, numerically stronger but morally weaker, it is not alone and will not be abandoned. I pray that this conviction can double the unwavering courage of Serbs and lead them always to new victories."
"All the social classes of the empire are deeply interested in the repugnance of the armies of the Kaiser. The working class is just as interested in the existence of Russian industries as employers. Peasants are no less interested in the development of agriculture; the murder of industries and agriculture like that committed by England in Ireland centuries ago is a dark prospect for all classes of society. If France and Belgium are threatened with political oppression then Russia is threatened with an even more terrible economic subjugation. This is the situation. The poorest classes of the population participate in this fight with what they have, with their blood. It is natural that they expect the material burdens of war not to fall on their shoulders, but on big business."
"The government said that during this war Greece had to remain neutral, but at the same time it did not hide that it had obligations towards one of the belligerents, Serbia, and that it had declared that it was determined to fulfil this obligation faithfully if the casus foederis came to pass. Greece, however, wished nothing more than such an opportunity should not occur, for it wanted the conflagration that gradually engulfed Europe not to spread over the Balkans, whose peoples, after two wars, so much needed rest."
"I am sorry to hear that Bulgaria is demanding concessions from us. In exchange for its friendship, it demands concessions in Macedonia. But in this case, which cannot be called friendship. Bulgaria is demanding this today because we are at war with Austria, and therefore we cannot oppose it. But by doing this, it simply betrays its weakness because it is a sure proof of weakness to hit one behind while it is fighting with the other. If Bulgaria is proud and strong it can be measured with us as soon as the war with Austria is over. A strong Bulgaria must be measured with the strong and not with the weak. Why do people in Bulgaria today insist on concessions? Do you know how many difficulties there are today in granting such territorial concessions?"
"Then the causes of the war are summarized and the importance of the war for industrial interests is emphasized. The main cause of the war is attributed to the irreconcilable economic conflict between the German and Russian interests created by the trade treaties favourable to Germany. Victorian Russia should dictate its own economic agenda to the defeated enemy. Without this result, all the sacrifices made will be vain, and will fall as a heavy and unbearable burden on the broken economic organization of the country. Industrial interests want a war to the end, and they say: ""Let the government know how to cultivate in the future among the peoples the conviction that the war will be carried out in the end, then the task of finding ways to continue the campaign will be greatly facilitated; for no sacrifice is too great for us for the overthrow of the economic yoke of Germany and for the conquest of economic independence. Nothing but strong will and determination are necessary."""
"Four different loans are envisaged: persons wishing to invest their savings at a reduced but secure interest rate will be able to buy certificates at a rate of 5 percent. loan. These certificates will have a nominal value of 100 rubles, and they will sell at $90. The interest rate will not be changed within the next 15 or 20 years. Therefore, the real interest rate will be 5.56 percent. on the initial investment. A loan of 6 percent. will be used for investors who like to place their loans on shorter terms. Certificates of this loan will be sold on premiums. Five-year certificates will be sold at ninety-six per hundred rubles nominal value, certificates of ninety-seven years, certificates of three years to ninety-eight years, certificates of two years to ninety-nine years and certificates of one year at par."
"It was a relief for Framton when the aunt got into the room with a whirlwind of excuses for making her late appearance. ""I hope Vera amused you?"" she said. ""She was very interesting,"" said Framton. ""I hope you don't care about the open window,"" said Ms. Sappleton quickly; ""My husband and my brothers will be at home directly from the shooting, and they always come in this way. They were out for a breath in the marshes today, so they're going to make a nice mess on my poor carpets. So, like you men, isn't it?"" She joyfully mocked the shooting and rarity of the birds, and the prospects for the duck in winter."
"The Serbian reoccupation of Belgrade is one of those military exploits which constitute historical phenomena. The Serbs have not only contributed to the greatest exploit of the European war, as far as the results are concerned, but have won for themselves an immortal page in the history of the world. Greece alone must show a similar achievement, although greater, when it expelled the Persian invasion. Only the achievements of Arhangelovatz, Uzhitse and Lazarevats can compare itself to a certain extent to the brilliance of the Marathon and the Plateae. And the Serbian achievement appears all the more Greek if we consider the analogies. The Serbs, until yesterday, a small people, with an almost insignificant army facing the masses of Austrian columns, subjected in time of peace, faced the most oppressive demands of Austrian diplomacy, considered as all the small peoples to live at the mercy of the great — when the hour of supreme defence for the altars and the homes struck, and facing an enemy threatening to swallow their country, they rose up from their revenge, and repeated their terrible exploits."
"Many trains bring hundreds of young English, French and Belgian soldiers injured. Many Red Cross offices are located in the largest hotels in the city. Many citizens have asked to take some of the wounded to their homes. We will have several of them at home. Mother is already preparing two bedrooms. She has moved Lili's bed in the kitchen. As for us, we will sleep in the armchairs. Lili speaks of war as an adult, and so seriously! She also wants to take care of the wounded. She will turn them away. She will make dresses for all her dolls and put them in bed. She puts all the history books on the table to interest the soldiers. Of course, she will read it herself. Then she collects all the old sheets to make some stuffed stuff, but she will do it in the kitchen when the wounded sleeps, so as not to worry them."
"With the end of last year of a long and exhausting struggle that we waged with incomparable self-denial, the Bulgarian people and my Government have once again directed their efforts towards the healing of the wounds of the recent past and the reshaping of national forces, as well as towards the creation of new resources and prosperity for the country. Our common peaceful activity has been interrupted by the break-up of the greatest and most terrible of all the wars that history has experienced to this day. Faced with this powerful struggle of European nations, my Government has considered it its duty, in front of the nation, and the path imposed upon it, to declare Bulgaria's neutrality and to maintain this attitude with firmness and honesty in accordance with international obligations and the interests of the homeland."
"Our relations with Turkey have been tense for a few months. But after the Bucharest negotiations, an agreement has been reached on the refugees. Those in Europe will learn that the Greeks have expelled two hundred thousand people from Thrace and Asia Minor. Some of them we have settled in the islands. Apart from these there are about fifty thousand Turkish refugees – but not persecuted – in Macedonia. A joint committee was to organise the exchange of these refugees at the beginning of the war. As to the question of ownership of the Aegean Islands, the Greek government considers the issue settled from an international point of view, not only by the Treaties of London and Athens, but also by the unanimous decision of all the European powers. The government has declared that it is prepared to satisfy Turkey on this subject, on the sine qua condition that the islands will continue to be occupied and administered by Greece in the same way as all the other provinces of the Hellenic Kingdom."
"I have made every effort to prevent the Second Balkan War, which, as we know, was beneficial to us. I have repeatedly said to the Bulgarians that they should not enter because in this case we would also enter it. But I did not succeed in my efforts. During the Second Balkan War, I did everything in my power to bring it to an end as quickly as possible. At the Bucharest Conference, I made efforts, as Mr Pashich and Mr Venizelos know very well, to obtain the best conditions for defeating Bulgaria. My objective was to obtain a new coalition of all Balkan States, including Romania."
"The following official statement on the tragic death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Duches [sic] Sophie de Hohenberg was issued this evening: ""While his imperial Royal Highness, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, with his consort, was heading for a reception at Sarajevo City Hall, a bomb was thrown on his motor car. His imperial Royal Highness kept his arm the bomb, which exploded after the passage of the archducal motor car."" Count Boos Waldeck and his aide-de-camp of the governor, Lieut. Colonel Morizzi, who was in the next car, were slightly injured."
"He was very hungry, for he had not eaten all that day; so he did not waste much anger on the bathtub, but he took the black bread, and bitten it, and then spit out the bite, for the bread was hard and mouldy. He did not begin to yield to his anger, for he had not drunk these many hours; having the hope of a beer or a wine of heather at the end of his day, he had left the streams intact, to make his supper the most delicious. Now he put the pitcher on his lips, but threw it directly from him, for the water was bitter and bad smell. Then he kicked the pitcher, so that it broke against the opposite wall, and he went down the cover to wrap it up with him for the night."
"The donkey, afraid of being killed, ran away. He took the road to Bremen, where he had often heard the street band play. He liked the music, so he thought he could join the band. He had not gone far when he had come on an old dog. The dog was pampering, as if he had run a long way. ""Why were you pranking, my friend?"" asked the donkey. ""Ah,"" said the dog, ""I'm too old for the hunt. My master wanted to get me killed. So I ran away. But how am I to find bread and meat, I don't know."" ""Well,"" said the donkey, ""come with me. I'm going to play in the band in Bremen. I think you and I can easily make a living by the music. I can play the lute, and you can play the boudin."""
"The United States Government is increasingly concerned about the large number of ships loaded with United States goods destined for neutral ports in Europe that have been seized on the high seas, taken to British ports and sometimes held for weeks by the British authorities, and during the first days of the war this Government assumed that the policy adopted by the United Kingdom Government was due to the unexpected outbreak of hostilities and the need for immediate action to prevent smuggling from reaching the enemy, which is why it was not prepared to judge this policy severely, nor to protest strongly, although it was clearly very detrimental to American trade with the neutral countries of Europe."
"The strength of a student of men is to travel — to study men, their habits, their character, their way of life, their behaviour under various conditions, their vices, their virtues and their peculiarities. Start with a careful observation of your fellow students and your teachers; then, each patient you see is a lesson in much more than the malfeasance he suffers. Mix as much as possible with the outside world, and learn his ways. Cultivated systematically, student societies, student union, gymnasium, and the outside social circle will allow you to overcome the dissent so able to go with bookishness and which can prove a very serious disadvantage in the afterlife. I cannot overemphasize the serious and attentive men among you the need to overcome this unfortunate failure in your student days. It is not easy for everyone to reach a happy environment, and the distinction between good self-confidence and ""cheek"", especially in junior students, is not always to be made."
"It was large and wide, Hancock was small, but he was sure there would be room. He had thrown himself on him like a wild animal. He had felt his throat warm and thin bend in his big hands... then the darkness, peace and rest, a nothingness that was certainly the oblivion that he had prayed so much. He had fulfilled his desire. He had secreted himself forever of persecutions – inside the sweetest little man he had ever met – in Hancock.... He opened his eyes and looked at him in a room he did not know. The walls were soft and of dark color. He was very quiet. The cushions were everywhere. He was peaceful, and out of the world. There was a window in front of the door, and there was a strong barred window. Delicious! No one could enter. He was sitting in a deep and comfortable chair. He felt rested and happy. There was a click, and he saw a small window in the door falling, as if it were worked by a sliding panel."
"But Borrow was not really born in East Dereham, but at a mile and a half, in the small hamlet of Dumpling Green, in what was then a magnificent desert of common bushes and furs, but is now a quiet landscape of fields and hedges. You will find the house in which the author of Lavengro first saw the light without much difficulty. It is a farm of fair size, with a long low facade separated from the road by a considerable strip of garden. It suggests a prosperous Yeoman class, and I knew farms in East Anglia not a greater worthy by the name 'hall.' Near the opposite is a pond. The hedges of size are a pleasure for us today, but you must return to mind a century ago when they were completely absent. The house belonged to George Borrow's maternal father, Samuel Perfrement, who cultivated the land adjacent to that time. Samuel and Mary Perfrement had eight children, one third of whom, Ann, was born in 1772."
"In the presence of such dangers, Thomas Lincoln spent his childhood. Born in 1778, he could not be more than four years that day, when his father had died next to him and his vengeance had been demanded by his brother as a solved boy. These were experiences such as making pioneers the robust men they were. They acquired heroic habits. Their sinews became perennial; their nerves turned to steel. Their senses were sharpened. They became alert, stable, rapid and devalued in all emergency situations. From Mordecai Lincoln, the boy who had shown such coldness and audacity on the day of his father's death, many stories are told after he had reached virility."
"Now that the battle of Hook's Farm is, as I explained, a simplification of the game, has quite to illustrate the game method; there is hardly a battle that will not prove to be more elaborate (and enlivened) than this little encounter. If a certain number of players and a sufficiently large room can be obtained, there is no reason why armies of several hundred soldiers should not fight over many square meters of model country. As long as each player has about a hundred men and three cannons, it is not necessary to lengthen the duration of a game on this account. But it is too laborious and confused for one player to manage more than that number of men."
"If someone looks at an image of Claude Monet from the point of view of a Raphael, he will see nothing more than a jargon without meaning of wild paint strokes. And if someone looks at a Raphael from the point of view of a Claude Monet, he will probably see only hard and tiny figures in a frame lacking the pleasant atmosphere that always envelops the shape seen in nature. So wide are some of the points of view of the painting. In the treatment of the form these differences of view make a great variety in the work. So no excuse should be made for the large amount of space occupied in the following pages by what is generally rejected as simple theory; but what is in reality the first essential of all good practice in the drawing."
"""Behold,"" he said, ""is the master of this house, I know him well. He was always a good businessman, and he made himself wonderfully rich a long time ago. If he had been wise, he would have stopped then. He would have handed over his things to someone else, and then he could have spent the rest of his life in all ease. But what did he do instead? He built ships and sent them to sea to trade with foreign lands. He thought he would get mountains of gold. ""But there were great storms on the water; his ships were devastated, and his riches were swallowed up by the waves. Now all his hopes are at the bottom of the sea, and his great riches have disappeared. ""There are many such cases. Men never seem to be satisfied unless they win the whole world. ""If I had enough to eat and carry, I would not want anything anymore."""
"Saint Augustine is no longer but a famous name. Apart from scholarly or theological circles, people do not read it any more. This is the true renown: we admire the saints, as we make great men, in confidence. Even his confessions are usually spoken only by hearsay. By this negligence, is it expiatory for the renewal of the glory in which he shone in the seventeenth century, when the Jansenians, in their inveterate obstinacy, identify him with the defense of their cause? The reputation of sour austerity and the argumentative and lamentable prolixity that attaches to the memory of all the writers of Port-Royal, except Pascal, did he also affect Augustine's work, enrolled in spite of him in the ranks of these schismatic piouss? And yet, if there had been beings that did not resemble Augustine, and that he would probably have attacked with all his eloquence and all the strength of his dialectics, they are the Jansenists."
"Sometimes, when I had turned off my candle, my eyes closed so quickly that I didn't even have time to say ""I'm going to sleep."" And half an hour later, the thought that it was time to go to sleep awakened me; I was trying to put the book that I imagined was still in my hands and blow the light; I was thinking all the time, while I was sleeping, of what I was reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own, until I actually seemed to have become the subject of my book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V. This impression would persist a few moments after my awakening; it did not disturb me, but it extended like scales on my eyes and prevented them from recording the fact that the candle was no longer burning."
"By turning back the old volumes of Punch, it is surprising to see how many points of the Maurier in his drawings and in the underlying legends are still good. As a simple ""joker"", he was perhaps the least capable of Punch's staff. His influence began when he started inventing imaginary conversations. In many cases, they do not represent the discussion of topical subjects, but they deal with social aberrations, dated only in the illustration of the costume of the time. In these imaginary conversations, he is already novelist. They record the strokes of finesse and subterfuges necessary to realize the vain ambitions that are the concern of the human genius in the superficial levels of society in all ages. We realize the waste of energy and diplomacy spent to mark small points in the social game. His art is a mirror of the qualities of human nature that enjoy a time of spring with each generation."
"There's no need to tell the story of this trip or to dwell on the trivial details of our life on board. Just say that in the middle of the Atlantic our engines have had a breakdown. The Peterhof came to a stop. If you ever got there on a big trip, you'll know that there's something striking about stopping a steam machine in the middle of the ocean. To be ejected on a sailboat can be boring: to be fainted—if such an expression can be used on a steamer-is almost too strange to be boring. Day and night, the engines stumbled until their beats penetrated into your own marrow, and when the beats suddenly die you are sensed of a shock. When the Peterhof stopped I ran on the deck as fast as if we had a collision."
"The Quadrangle Club, Chicago, September 30, 99. Your generous praises make me rather ashamed: you should keep it for something that matters. At least other people should: find you a brilliant word, and the proportion of things would be kept. As for me, I do my best to keep the proportion of things, in the midst of non-standards and a dark fog-expanse of darkened advice. Well! Here I groan in my third sentence, and the purpose of this note was not to groan, but to thank you for the new one's heart. I take the friendly words (because I need them cruelly) and forget the inadequate opportunity of them. I look forward with almost the feverish pleasure of the new year, when I will be among the friendships that time and absence and half-interference have only made shine with an inner light; and when, if accompanied, I can move to think and live a little."
"It was not a robust childhood. The new baby managed to spend the winter, a question of comments within the family and neighbours. The strength was added, but slowly; ""Little Sam,"" as it was called, was always delicate during these early years. It was a curious childhood, full of strange impressions, fantastic and contradictory influences, stimulating both the imagination and the embryonic philosophy of life that began almost with childhood. John Clemens rarely devoted all the time to the company of his children. He took care of their comfort and mental development as well as he could, and gave advice on occasion. He bought a book from time to time, then – sometimes a book of images – and subscribes to Peter Parley magazine, a wonder of pleasure for older children, but he did not join their entertainments, and he never laughed, and Mark Twain never remembered ever seeing or hearing his father laugh."
"I do not know any wild custom or habit of thought that does not have his partner in civilized countries. For any malicious or absurd practice of natural man, I can name you one of ours which is essentially the same. And almost all the customs of our barbaric ancestors in historical times persist in any form today. We make ourselves look great in battle - for this matter, we fight. Our women paint their faces. We feel the obligation to dress more or less in the same way, inventing the most ingenious reasons to do so and effectively despising and persecuting those who do not care to conform. Almost in the memory of the living men bearded were stoned in the streets; and a New York ecclesiastical who wore his beard as Christ wore his, was put in prison and variously persecuted until his death."
"It was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was intended to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then to be born such that it was never parallel in the history of man. Two sailors were washing the bridges of the Fuwalda, the first companion was in service, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice. The men were working in the back towards the little party that was facing the sailors. Closer and closer they arrived, until one of them was directly behind the captain. At another point, he would have passed and this strange story would never have been recorded."
"But Edwin, suddenly stopped by what he saw, drew the bow cord on a fitted arrow. He had stopped on the edge of a crevice in the embankment. An old culvert had washed here, and the creek, no longer confined, had cut a passage through the fill. On the other side, the end of a projected and covered rail. He showed rusty through the creeping vines that invaded him. Beyond, squatting by a bush, a rabbit looked through him in a trembling hesitation. Full fifty feet was the distance, but the arrow was a true flash; and the transfixed rabbit, shouting in sudden fear and wounded, struggled painfully in the brush. The boy himself was a flash of brown skin and flying fur as he bound the steep wall of the distance and the other side. His lean muscles were steel springs that were liberating in graceful and effective action."
"It was only in the morning that we entered the port of Havre that I was able to shake my shadow. Then, the strange curiosities, the chatter in an unknown language and the excitement of landing and the passage of customs officers made me completely forget the events of a few days before. Indeed, I grew so light that when I took my first glimpse of the train that was to lead us to Paris, I enjoyed a warm laugh. The toy engine, the small compartment cars with tiny and old wheels, struck me as being extremely funny. But before I arrived in Paris, my respect for our train rose considerably. I found that the ""small"" engine made a remarkably fast time, and that the old wheels went very well. I even started to appreciate the cars ""cheap"" for their privacy. As I looked at the scenery of the car window, it seemed too good to be real."
"It is not to be assumed that, by stating the memories of this half hour between the moment my uncle left my room until we met again at dinner, I lose the sight of the ""Folly d'Almayer"". After confessing that my first novel started in idleness - a holiday task - I think I also gave the impression that it was a much delayed book. It was never rejected from my mind, even when the hope of never ending it was very weak. A lot of things came in his way: daily tasks, new impressions, old memories. It was perhaps not the result of a need - the famous need for expression that the artists found in their search for motives. The necessity that pushed me was a hidden, obscure, completely masked and incompetent phenomenon. Or perhaps an idle and frivolous magician (there must be magicians in London) had cast a spell on me through his speaker's window while I was exploring the west side of the road without exploring the roadside."
"As for the scene, it must be remembered that Egypt of these days was not Egyptian as we understand the word, but rather Greek. Cleopatra itself was of Greek origin. The kingdom of Egypt had been created by a general of Alexander the Great after the death of this splendid warrior. His capital, the most brilliant city in the Greco-Roman world, had been founded by Alexander himself, who gave him his name. With his own hands, he traced the boundaries of the city and gave the most peremptory orders to become the metropolis of the whole world. The orders of a king cannot give a lasting grandeur to a city; but Alexander's bright eye and his wonderful brain saw as soon as the site of Alexandria was such that a large commercial community planted there would live and flourish throughout the centuries that followed."
"This is how Wolsey is valued by what he chose to do rather than by what he did. He was greater than his achievements. Yet Wolsey's greatness did not rise beyond the conditions of his own age, and he left no legacy of great thought or enterprise. The age in which he lived was not one of the high aspirations or noble goals; but he was one of the great purposes and agitated energy. No drawing was cast into a mould as large as Wolsey's; no stateman showed such skill that he patiently weaved the network of the diplomatic plot. His resources were small, and he fed them with care."
"After a winter in the city, so suddenly falling into the intense calm of the countryside makes an almost ghostly impression on one, like an enchanted silence, a silence that listens and looks but never speaks, finger on lip. There is a spectral quality on all that falls on the eye: the woods, like large green clouds, the flowers of the countryside, the farms still half lost in the flowering of the orchard – everything seems to exist in a dream. Everything is so calm, everything is so supernaturally green. Nothing moves or speaks, except the soft susurre of the spring wind sweeping the young buds up in the calm sky, or a bird from time to time, or a small stream singing gently to himself among the crowds. Although, from houses a note here and there, there are obviously human inhabitants of this green silence, none must be seen."
"Frederick Fleet, who was on the lookout in the nest of the Titanic's crow when the giant ship crashed into the iceberg, swore that not a single ship on the Titanic was supplied with sea goggles and stated that if his request for such glasses in Southampton was not refused, the Titanic could still be floating.""I could easily have seen the iceberg with sea goggles in a long time so that the ship would be driven off the road,"" said Fleet, and gave in detail his request to Southampton for them. Although all the other liners are provided, Fleet swore that his request was completely denied and was told that there were no glasses for him."
"This morning, at 8:30 a.m., a short wireless signal saying that the Titanic was still floating and was moving under its own steam was taken. White Star's New York office issued an official statement that it would be impossible for the Titanic to sink, no matter how much it could have been injured. Shortly after 9 a.m., a message was received that the Carpathians, the Parisians and the Virginians were ""holding by"" the ship struck, and that the Baltic was approaching quickly. Shortly afterwards another message came that the transfer of the passengers had begun. The first boatloads were rowed to the Carpatia. The Titanic rescue boats represent the last safe word. They are large, and non-powerful. Everyone can hold 50 passengers. Only 35 passengers were taken today, however. The job of transferring passengers at sea is still full of danger. It was less today than usual."
"When I was a seven-year-old, my friends on vacation filled my pocket with brass. I went straight to a store where they were selling children's toys, and, being charmed by the sound of a whistle that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one. I then ran home and went to whistle all over the house, very happy with my whistle, but disturbing the whole family. My brothers and sisters and cousins, understanding the market that I had made, told me that I had given four times as much for it as it was worth it; put me in mind what good things I could have bought with the rest of the money; and laughed so much about me for my madness that I was weeping with vexation; and the reflection gave me more regret than the whistle gave me pleasure. This, however, was after use, the impression of continuing to think; so often when I was tempted to buy something useless, and I thought, ""I didn't give myself too much regret than the whistle gave me pleasure."
"When I was a little boy, I remember, a cold winter morning, I was accosted by a smiling man with an axe on his shoulder. ""My pretty boy,"" he said, ""has he a grindstone to your father?"" ""Yes, sir,"" he said. ""You're a good little boy!"" he said. ""Would you, let me grind the axe on it?"" Please with the compliment of ""good little boy,"" ""Oh, yes, sir,"" I replied. ""It's down in the shop."" ""And you, my man,"" he said, ""put me on my head, ""give me a little hot water?"" How could I refuse? I was running, and I would soon bring a kettle.""How old are you - and what's your name?"" he continued, without waiting for an answer. ""I'm sure you're one of the best guys I've ever seen. Do you just want to turn a few minutes for me?"""
"There is the national flag. It must be cold, it can look at its folds, tear itself in the breeze, without pride of country. If it is in a foreign country, the flag is the company and the country itself, with all its attachments. Its highest beauty is in what it symbolizes. It is because it represents everything, that all look at it with pleasure and reverence. It is a piece of bread raised in the air; but it speaks sublimely, and each part has a voice. Its red and white alternating stripes proclaim the original union of thirteen states to maintain the Declaration of Independence. Its white stars on a field of blue proclaim this union of states constituting our national constellation, which receives a new star with each new state. Both together mean past and present union. The same colors have a language that has been officially recognized by our fathers. White is for purity, red for value, blue for justice; and all together, buzzing, scratches, stars and colors, flaming in the sky, make the flag of our country to be cherished."
"Once upon a time there was a lazy boy, and when everyone had planted their paddy, he was only about to plow. But the old man of the season, seeing him, said, ""The season is gone; what are you plowing for now? The paddy is all planted, and it is late."" But the boy did not listen to him, and was plowing firmly before him, beating his cattle as he was going. And when the old man asked him again and again, he cried, ""What sort of old man is that? Can't he see that I am busy? I know very well what I am?"" But the old man said gently, ""Nay, my son: but it is for your good that I speak to you."" And the boy said, ""Speak quickly then, and I have finished."" And the old man said, ""My son, the season is gone; what is to plow now?"""
"""Jimmy,"" our young black bear, was known to all the children in the neighborhood. If a children's vote had been taken for the most popular animal in the county, Jimmy would have been elected unanimously. If the adults had held the election, however, it is certain that there would have been votes against him. For example, when one of our neighbors came home one night, entered the bed in the dark, and unintentionally struck a bear who had climbed to a window earlier in the evening, of course, he had his clogged toes. This man would never have voted for Jimmy. Neither the farmer's wife would have met one evening coming from the barn with a new bucket of milk. The weather was hot, Jimmy was thirsty, and he was particularly hungry for new milk."
"They must, I think, be read in the light of this youthful explosion. In a certain psychological sense, he had really been wronged. But he had only become aware of his wrongs as his wrongs had been gradually corrected. Similarly, it has often been found that a man who can patiently bear criminal servitude by a miscarriage of justice nevertheless, when his cause is well asserted, disputes on the amount of compensation or complains of small light in his professional existence. These are the marks of Dickens' first literary action. He has in it all the particular hardness of youth; a hardness which in those who have been unjustly treated even in impudence. It is a terrible thing for every man to discover that his elders are bad. And this almost incendiary courage of youth must in part be held responsible for Dickens' intelligence, this almost offensive intelligence which, in these earlier books of his sometimes irritates us like the seer gibes in the great conversation of a schoolgirl."
"The cabin was facing a plain of plain-foot without a tree in sight. A mile from the west was a low stone house, and immediately in front of us opened a half-section of unsplit soda. To the north, as far as I can see, the land shrouded like an ocean of Russians, with barely a roof to flank its solitary dispersion. I cannot say that I loved it or did not love it. I simply marveled; and while I was wandering in the courtyard, the hired man grinned a little corn flour in a stove, and this, with butter and gingerbread, formed my first breakfast in Mitchell County. For a few days, my brother and I had nothing to do but prevent the cattle from wandering, and we used our leisure to familiarize ourselves with the region all around."
"Wendy was married in white with a pink scarf. It is strange to think that Peter did not light up in the church and banned the banns. Years were still rolling, and Wendy had a daughter. It should not be written in ink but in a golden splash. Her name was Jane, and she always had a curious look, as if from the moment she arrived on the continent, she wanted to ask questions. When she was old enough to ask them that they were mainly about Peter Pan. She liked to hear about Peter, and Wendy told her everything she could remember in the same nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It was now Jane's crib, for her father had bought it from Wendy's father's three hundred, who no longer loved the stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten. There were only two beds in the crib now, Jane and her nurse; and there was no kennel, because Nana had also died."
"Once, when I came back from a hunt, with an empty gun (using all my ammunition), an inflamed boar rushed on me. Well, you know how unpleasant such a meeting can be, so I'm sure no one would believe me a coward to hastely climb the nearest tree; it was a young birch that couldn't bear my weight. The boar made a dash for the tree, but it was too late a moment, because I had just pulled my legs out of its reach. But its rush was so violent that its defences crossed the trunk of the tree and threw an inch across the other side. I slipped the tree, took a stone the size of my fist, and rinsed the projection points of the defenses. You can imagine what narrow escape I had when I told you that the beast weighed five tons, a good deal for a wild boar."""
"When I was a kid, my grandfather frequently told a story about a dog he knew, as an example of true fidelity. This animal was a mastiff belonging to a friend, Mr. Prideaux, to whom he was a constant companion. Every time Mr. Prideaux went out for a walk, Turk was sure to be close to his heels. Street dogs barked and snarl to the giant as his massive form drew their attention, but Turk rarely noticed them. At night he slept outside his master's door, and no sentry could be more alert on his watch than the faithful dog. One day, Mr. Prideaux had a dinner party. The dog Turk was present, and stretched out his huge shape on the heart bug. It was a cold night in winter, and Mr. Prideaux's friends after dinner began to discuss the subject of dogs."
"In the middle of the afternoon, we crossed a low rocky ridge and we saw at our feet a basin, or round valley, of singular beauty. Its walls were formed by steep mountains. At its upper end were a small lake, bordered on one side by a meadow of emerald green. The other side of the lake marked the edge of the forest of frowning pines that filled the rest of the valley. Beyond the lake, the ground rose in a pass much frequented by game in the past days, their paths along thick zigzags, each gradually disappearing after a few hundred meters, then starting again in a small place different, as the playing trails seem so often to do."
"No boy can afford to neglect his work, and with a boy, working as a rule means studying. A boy should work, and should work hard, at his lessons — in the first place, for the good of what he will learn, and in the next place, for the effect on his own character to settle resolutely to learn it. Shiftlessness, looseness, indifference in the study are almost certain to mean the inability to embark on other paths of life. I do not believe in bad luck in school hours, or in the kind of animal spirit that leads to bad learning; and I believe that these boys who take part in a hard game outside of school will not find need to play on horseback in school."
"The mason did not oppose it. The stranger returned, and, being caught up, he was led by the stranger through various rough ways and winding passages until they stopped in front of the gate of a house. The stranger then applied a key, turned a lock, digging, and opened what sounded like a monstrous door. They entered; the door was closed and bolted, and the mason was led through an echo corridor and a spacious room to an inner part of the building. Here, the dressing was removed from his eyes, and he found himself in a courtyard lighted by a single lamp. In the centre was the dry basin of an old fountain, under which the stranger asked him to form a small vault, bricks and mortars at hand. He worked all night, but without finishing the work."
"The widow fled like a living schoolgirl. All the sisters watched her enter the sled with the deacon, and resumed the previous discussion with much more interest. But little received the widow and less received the deacon. He had bought a new horse and he wanted the widow's advice, because the Widow Stimson was a competent judge of fine horse meat. If Deacon Hawkins had an insatiable ambition it was to own a horse that could float his heels in front of the best that Squire Hopkins was driving. In his age, the deacon was not a deacon by a great deal. But as the years gathered behind him, he repulsed most of the frivolities of youth and now held to the one to drive a fast horse. No other man in the county drove anything faster than Squire Hopkins, and he the deacon had not been able to cast the dust."
"I took the bay of the bush, the brown nut of the tree, but the heart of the happy little bird was not broken by me. I saw them in their curious nests, lying near, with wild eyes, like sparkling pearls, to notice if the evil was near; I passed them, and blessed them all; I felt it was good to leave without moving the small creatures whose house was in the wood. And here, even now, above my head, a lustful rogue sings; he stings his breast and his neck inflamed, and he slits his small wing. He will not fly; he knows well, while he shits on this vaporizer, I would not hurt him for a world, or interrupt his rest. Sing, sing, bluff! and fill my heart with summer joy; he took a lot of time with measures full of sadness!"
"The sharpness of the air was now tempered by a sun that overhanged the wooded ridges and shone with luxurious heat on the world of the lake and the forest below; the divers flew through the sparkling sprinkling that the wind raised; the divers shook their heads in the sun and shook out of sight intelligently; and, until the eye could reach, the leagues of an endless bush were lifted up, desolating in its solitary and grandiose sweep, overflowing by the foot of the man, and stretching its powerful and intact carpet to the frozen shores of Hudson Bay. Simpson, who saw it for the first time while paddling hard in the bows of the dance canoe, was enchanted by its austere beauty. His heart drank in the direction of freedom and wide spaces, just as his lungs drank in the fresh and fragrant wind."
"We pass the order to descend in any condition, even overcrowded. The way is off the ship, and it is with some apprehension that we look at the packaged boats falling from the heads of the davit. The shrill ring of the sheaves indicates a tension that is not far from breaking the point. Many of the lifeboats reach the water safely with their heavy loads, but the pressure on the pitchers — far beyond their workload — is too great for everyone to stand there. Two boats descend through the race. The men in them are thrown violently into the water, where they float in the washing and the broken plantation. A third chevronment of the following autumn, having shot down his man at the separation of the pitch before. Absorbed by the stern, she straight, disengaged, and drifted with the men hanging on the lines of life. We cannot attempt to reach the men in the water."
"There was one thing that Flambeau, with all his dexterity of disguise, could not cover, and it was his singular size. If Valentin's short eye had caught a great apple-woman, a great grenadier, or even a tolerable duchess, he could have stopped them on the spot. But throughout his train there was no one who could be a disguised Flambeau, no more than a cat could be a disguised giraffe. On the people on the boat he had already satisfied himself; and the people gathered at Harwich or on the trip were bound with certainty to six. There was a small railway official traveling to the terminus, three rather short market gardeners picked up two stations after, a very short widow rising from a small town of Essex, and a very short Roman Catholic priest rising from a small village of Essex."
"Without being really afraid of mice, Theodoric classified them as one of the most crude incidents of life, and considered that Providence, with a little moral courage, could have recognized long ago that they were not indispensable, and had removed them from the traffic. As the train slipped out of the station, Theodoric's nervous imagination accused itself of exhaling a weak smell of stable court, and perhaps displaying a mouldy straw or two on his exceptionally well brushed clothes. Fortunately, the only other occupation of the compartment, a lady of about the same age, seemed inclined to sleep rather than examine; the train was not to stop until the terminus was reached, in about an hour, and the car was so old that it had no communication with a corridor, so no other travelling companion was likely to interfere with the semi-privacy of Theodoric."
"Amory is this science whose rules and laws govern the use, display, meaning and knowledge of the signs and emblems represented on the shield, helmet or banner. Heraldry has a broader meaning, because it understands everything in the functions of a herald; and while Armory is undoubtedly Heraldry, the regulation of ceremonies and pedigree issues, which are really also in the field of heraldry, most of the time are not Armory. ""Armory"" refers only to emblems and devices. ""Armoury"" refers to weapons themselves as weapons of war, or to the place used for the storage of weapons. But these spelling distinctions are modern. The word ""Arms"", like many other words in English, has several meanings, and at present is used in several senses."
"Vashti felt for a moment alone, then she generated the light, and the view of her room, flooded with radiation and nailed with electric buttons, she came back to life. There were buttons and switches everywhere, buttons to call for food, music, clothes. There was the hot bath button, by the pressure of which a marble basin (imitation) rose from the ground, filled to the edge of a hot deodorized liquid. There was the cold bath button. There was the button that produced the literature, and there were of course the buttons by which she communicated with her friends. The room, although it contained nothing, was in contact with everything she was dealing with in the world. Vashti's next move was to turn off the isolation switch, and all the accumulations of the last three minutes burst on it. The room was filled with the noise of the bells, and talking-tubes."
"I remember a splendid morning, all blue and silver, during the summer holidays, when I reluctantly ripped myself out of the task of doing nothing in particular, and I put on a hat of one kind and took a walking stick, and put six chalks of very color in my pocket. I then went into the kitchen (which, with the rest of the house, belonged to an old woman very square and reasonable in a village of Sussex), and asked the owner and the occupier of the kitchen if she had brown paper. She had a lot of things; in fact, she had too much; and she had misunderstood the purpose and reason for the existence of brown paper. She seemed to have the idea that if a person wanted brown paper he should want to tie up packages; what was the last thing I wanted to do; indeed, it was something I found beyond my mental capacity."
"All morning, there had been a small gathering of people outside the door. The funeral coach came, and a very small thing was placed there and covered with flowers. A flower plant of wall in the garden would have covered it. The coach took the road to Dorking, followed by a few others, and in an instant or two all seemed silent and deserted, the cottage, the garden, and Box Hill. The cottage was not deserted, as they knew who now put themselves in the round in front of it, their eyes on the gate closed. They were the powerful company, his children, — Lucy and Clara and Rhoda and Diana and Rose and the old Mel and Roy Richmond and Adrian and Sir Willoughby and a hundred others, and they stood in line against the boxwood, waiting for him to come out. Each of his wives wore a flower, and the hands of all his men were ready for salvation."
"An oil painting prevented him and held him back. A heavy surf thundered and burst on a flowing rock; the lowering of the storm clouds covered the sky; and, outside the surf line, a pilot-schooner, near the sea, bowed down until every detail of his deck was visible, rushed against a stormy sunset sky. There was beauty, and she irresistibly attracted him. He forgot his clumsy walk and approached the canvas, very close. The beauty fainted from the canvas. His face expressed his impertinence. He looked at what seemed to be a fear of painting, and then moved away. Immediately, all the beauty returned to the canvas."
"At 9 a.m., the president, Kid Mullaly, was rushing to the ground with a lady on his arm. As the Loreleys were his golden hair. Her ""yes"" was softened to a ""yah"", but her quality of assent was patently to the most Milesian ears. She walked on her own train and was blushing, and—she smiled in the eyes of Kid Mullaly. And then, as the two stood in the middle of the waxed floor, the thing happened to prevent many lamps from burning at night in many studies and libraries. She shouted with one oath—the Kid's favorite oath—and with her deep voice; and while the Small Hours Social Club went frantically in pieces, she did not boast of Tommy, the waitress made an oath—the Kid's favorite oath—and with her own deep voice."
"This valley, two or three miles wide, extends between low hills, gently wavy, crowned with oaks, maples and birch. Although dotted with wild flowers in the spring, it seems severe, serious and sometimes even sad. The green grass gives it a monotony like that of stagnant water. Even in the beautiful days, one is aware of a harsh and cold climate. The sky seems more awesome than the earth. It extends on it with a tearing smile; it constitutes all the movement, grace, the exquisite charm of this delicate and tranquil landscape. Then, when winter comes, the sky merges with the earth in a kind of chaos. The fogs descend thick and cling. The white fogs, which in the summer veil the bottom of the valley, give way to thick clouds and dark mountains, but slowly scattered by a red and cold sun."
"I had never missed a companion in the woods when I could take a path. The ""possum and I eat together. And it was just the communion that I needed, this sharing of persimmons with the ""possum. I had broken bread, not with the ""possum only, but with all the out-doors. I was now able to enter the woods, for I was filled with good will and persimmons, as full as the ""possum; and putting myself under his gentle direction, I descended on the ground, took his awkward path, and descended to the marsh. Such an entrance is one of the special joys of winter. Entering with a fox, a mink, or a ""possum through the door of the woods is to be found at home."
"The forests of the North are quite silent in winter, but the silence of Barren's Lands is much deeper. Even in the depths of the middle of winter, the northwest bush has voices and is full of animal life. The barking cry of crows (these birds are the greatest nuisance imaginable to the trapper, whose baits they steal even before he turns his back) is still heard; snowbirds and other small winged creatures are never quiet between sunset and sunrise; the grey rabbit, whose black eye resembles a pearl betrays its presence among snow drifts despite its white snow fur, is quite common; and the childish lamentations of coyotes are heard every night."
"At man's heels, a dog, a great native husky, the good wolf dog, coated with gray and without any visible or temperamental difference of his brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the huge cold. He knew that it was not time to travel. His instinct told him a story more true than what had been told him by the man's judgment. In reality, it was not only colder than fifty under zero; it was colder than seventy-five below, than seventy-five below zero. It was seventy-five under zero. Since the freezing point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of gel obtained. The dog knew nothing about thermometers. Perhaps in his brain there was no acute consciousness of a condition of very cold as in the man's brain. But the crude had its instinct."
"A small brown face, with moustaches. A serious round face, with the same wink of eye that had first drawn his attention. Small neat ears and thick silky hair. It was the Water Rat! So the two animals stood and looked carefully. ""Hullo, Mole!"" said the Water Rat. ""Hullo, Rat!"" said the Mole. ""Do you want to come?"" asked the Rat at the moment. ""Oh, all his good at TALK,"" said the Mole, rather sparkling, he was new in a river life and waterfront and his ways. The rat did not say anything, but laid and picked up a rope and dragged on it; then he went slightly into a small boat that the mole had not observed. He was painted blue out and white inside, and was just the size for two animals; and the whole heart of the mole went at once, even though he did not yet fully understand its uses."
"When insomnia can be directly attributed to mental causes, Emmanuel's treatment, if one wants to trust the experiences done in Boston and Northampton, is as surely a specific quinine as malaria. If in any case the medical diagnosis cannot find any physical reason for insomnia, Emmanuel's treatment is both in order. The patient is admitted to the Rector's study. The very atmosphere encourages frankness. The concealment of any fact or circumstance that relates to the case is detrimental to the improvement. I once again refused to see a patient who had not given all her confidence, until she was ready to speak with more freedom. Physical habits are invariably considered and corrected whenever necessary. Deep breathing is prescribed. Dr. Learned's method is sometimes suggested, and always Dr. Noble's. Drugs are first retained. Tea, coffee and all other stimulants that directly affect the brain are banned from evening meal."
"One day, while he was buying a large bundle of wood from a poor man, a priest came. He saw the few cents that the rich man had thrown at the poor man's feet, and he could not help but say: ""My rich brother, can't you be more generous than that? Do you not see that this poor man of wood brought you a great bundle of wood, and you send him with only one or two cents? How can he buy enough bread to keep himself and his family from starving himself with such a small wage? But the rich man was very upset by the words of the priest. ""What is the poor man?"" he cried, and he led the poor and the priest to his door."
"This problem of education, begun in 1838, continued for three years, while the baby grew up, like other babies, unconsciously, like a vegetable, the outside world working as he had never worked, to prepare his new universe for him. Often in old age, he was concerned about whether, on the doctrine of chances, he was free to accept himself or his world as an accident. No such accident had ever occurred before in the human experience. For him alone, the old universe was thrown into the pile of ashes and a new one created. He and his eighteenth century, Troglodytic Boston were suddenly cut - separated forever - in action if not in feeling, by the opening of Boston and Albany Railroad; the appearance of the first Cunard fumes in the bay; and the telegraphic messages that brought from Baltimore to Washington the news that Henry Clay and James K. Polk were appointed for the presidency."
"In the interest of meeting the other guests, and what about my unfavorable impression, I forgot everything about the working-class philosopher, although once or twice at the table I noticed him, especially the twinkling in the eye as he listened first to the speech of one minister and then another. He has humor, I thought, and I almost forgave him his clothes. But the time passed, and the dinner passed, and he never opened his mouth to speak, while the ministers spoke endlessly about the working-class and his relationship with the church, and what the church had done and was doing for her. I noticed that my father was bored because Ernest did not speak."
"A light fire burned in a large fireplace, and an old man standing his back to her, in evening robe and with a chain around his neck, looked at the newspaper which he held lying in both hands before his calm and severe face. He did not move; but another laquais, in brown trousers and claw-hammer coat bordered with thin yellow cord, approaching Mr. Verloc listened to the murmuring of his name, and turning his heel in silence, began to walk, without looking back once. Mr. Verloc, thus led along a passage from the ground to the left of the large upholstered staircase, was suddenly moved to enter a very small room furnished with a heavy writing table and some chairs. The servant closed the door, and Mr. Verloc remained alone. He did not take a seat."
"One morning, bright and early, a sheep and a curly-tailed pig began to find a house in the world. For what they both wanted was more than a house for them. ""We are going to build a house,"" said the sheep and the curly-tailed pig, ""and there we will live together."" So they went on a long way, on the fields, on the alleys, and on the alleys, and on the orchards, and in the woods, until they all came on a rabbit. ""Where are you going?"" asked the rabbit of both. ""We are going to build a house,"" said the sheep and the pig. ""Can I live with you?"" asked the rabbit. ""What can you do to help?"" asked the sheep and the pig. ""The rabbit scratched his leg with his left back foot for a minute, and then he said, ""I can grow with my sharp teeth; I can put them with my legs."" ""Well,"" said the sheep and the pig; ""you can come with us."""
"It was a dark night, and no one was close to asking for water, so the little girl took her tin dipper and left alone in the spring to bring a drink to her mother. She travelled a long way through the woods, and ran so that she became very tired, being such a little girl; but she filled her tin dipper in the spring and went home. Sometimes the water was poured out, because it was not easy to carry, and sometimes the little girl stumbled on the stones in the dark road. Suddenly, she felt a warm touch on her hand, and she stopped. It was a little dog that followed her, for he too, was almost dying of thirst, and he had touched her hand with his warm tongue. The little girl looked at her dipper. There was only a very small water, but she poured a few drops in her hand, and left the dog thirsty to let them go."
"The child went out of the house, and crossed the garden, and went down into the woods as fast as her feet could carry it. As she rushed, a red squirrel jumped on her way and the little girl said to her: ""Red Squirrel, you don't have to work, do you? You can just play, and eat nuts from morning to night. Isn't that all?"" ""No work!"" chatted the red squirrel. ""Why, I work now, and I worked all day long yesterday, and all day long before. I have a family living in the old oak, and I have to store nuts for the winter. I don't have time to stop and play."" Just then a bee came buzzing and the little girl said, ""Little bee, do you have work to do?"" ""Work!"" was buzzing the bee."
"""Madame,"" said the white cock, bowing down very low, ""your boredom is mine, that is, I am hungry too. But we could be worse. We could be in a box on our way to the market. It is true that we have nothing to eat today, but we have at least enough room to stretch our wings. ""Why, it's a fact,"" ripped the brown hen. And the whole feathered family — even the smallest chickens — stretched their wings, and looked a little more joyful. ""Now,"" went on the cock, ""suppose that we have a little music to encourage us and help pass the hours until that time."
"The Spanish officer made a peremptory gesture so that the ship would come to anchor in the shelter given by a huge corner of the continent, whose point of the fort was the extreme west. The Russians, as it suited to the peaceful nature of their mission, obeyed without delay. Before their resting place, and among the sand hills one thousand from the beach, was a quadrangle of buildings some two hundred square feet and surrounded by a wall of about fourteen feet high and seven feet thick. They knew to be the Presidio. They saw the officers who had welcomed them gallop on the hill behind the fort at the more ambitious enclosure, and, on the square, concerted with another group that seemed to be in a state of corresponding excitement. A few moments later a deputation of officers, accompanied by a priest in the brown habit of the Franciscan order, began on horseback for the beach."
"Then he said goodbye to his family, and went away. When he was halfway, he met a merchant whom he knew, and they spent the same inn for the night. They had tea together, and then slept in adjacent rooms. It was not Aksionov's habit to sleep late, and, wanting to travel while he was still fresh, he woke up his driver before dawn, and told him to put in the horses. Then he made his way through the owner of the inn (who lived in a cottage in the back), paid his bill, and continued his journey. When he had left for about twenty-five miles, he stopped for the horses to be fed. Aksionov rested while in the inn, then he went out into the porch, and ordered a samovar to be heated, came out of his guitar and began to play."
"There was no room for men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they did a practice of washing them in the water that was to be washed in the sausage. There were the pieces of smoked meat, and the pieces of corned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, which would be thrown into old barrels in the cellar and left there. Under the rigid economy system that the packers applied, there was work that he paid only to do once in a long time, and among them was the cleaning of the barrels of waste. Each spring they did so; and in the barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stagnant water – and the load of the cart would be taken and thrown into the hoppers with fresh meat, and sent to the breakfast of the public."
"Undoubtedly, much to the disappointment and sorrow of his father, who wished him as the only son to pursue the traditions of the family, although he wrote two engineering essays of the highest promise, the engineering was abandoned, and he consented to study the law. He had already contributed to College Magazines, and had even had a short spell of edition one; of one of them, he gave a rapy report. Very shortly after his call to the Bar articles and essays of his pen began to appear in Macmillan, and later, more regularly in the Cornhill. The attentive readers quickly began to note here the presence of a new force. He had gone on the Inland Travel and a report of it was in hand; and had made this tour in the Cevennes which he described under the title Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes, with Modestine, sometimes doubting who was the donkey, but on this tower a chill developed a germ of lung disease already present, or produced; and the results unfortunately remained."
"It was claimed that these escapes were organized by a group of Englishmen, whose audacity seemed unsurpassed, and who, from the mere desire to mingle with what did not concern them, spent their free time ripping away legal victims destined for Madame la Guillotine. These rumours soon developed extravagantly; there was no doubt that this group of Englishmen existed; moreover, they seemed to be under the direction of a man whose luck and audacity were almost fabulous. Strange stories were immune to the way in which he and those aristos he rescued suddenly became invisible as they reached the barricades and escaped from the doors by a simple supernatural agency. No one had seen these mysterious Englishmen; as for their leader, he had never been spoken, except with a superstitious shudder. Citizen Foucquier-Tinville would receive a piece of paper from a public source during the day. He would sometimes find it in his pocket when he was handed over to the public."
"It is wonderful to see how much one can see out of the angle of the eye, while pretending to see simple landscapes. The driver looked down, while driving safely out of the deck, and shook his head to the whirlwind of water that rushed and built up, dark and muddy, approaching under the rotten board; then he feared his whip, and the horses attacked the little hill firmly. The thickness, overhanging trees on each side now darkened the light, and the two lead matrons once again dazzling over the opposite shoulders, deeply ignorant of the other. The husbands looked politely upon them. The eyes of the blond son were still looking for the brown girl, but he was furtively made and rather uncomfortable, for the girl was now making a little dazzling on her own account. The blonde matron had just swept her eyes on the girl's skirt, estimating the fit and material with so artistically veiled contempt that he could almost be understood in the darkness."
"No matter where there is a border, where there are new and difficult conditions to fulfill, tasks to accomplish, you can find this Susan B. Anthony kind of woman. It's the house brand, dyed-in-the-wool, as distinguished from the brand boudoir, beauty-doctor. Let me show it to you in her rocking chair. It's not without determined effort and a lot of strenulosity expenses that I can do, for Susan B. Anthony is the most alive 85 girl I've ever pursued. Although eighty-five are her birthdays, she hasn't reached the age of the chimney-corner. You can't tell yourself, when I finished this, that and the other — I've taken care of the most pressing business — I'm going to fall on Miss Anthony. She's 85 years old, and sure to be home. On the contrary, you're going to get up, as I did, earlier than your wont, and if you're wise and buy time and travel you'll start before breakfast! Not like I'll start before breakfast!"
"Although he would have been quite extravagant and something of a dandy, he could say that he could account for every sixpence that he passed after the age of twenty-one. Upon leaving Oxford, he settled into the life of a parson of countries with conscientiousness, and was considered the best magistrate of the South Hams. By cultivating his own glow, as he did, with skill and knowledge, perpetually occupied, as he was, with clerical or secular affairs, he found the Church of England, without then being disturbed by a wave of enthusiasm, both necessary and sufficient for his religious sense."
"And at the door of the hardware store, the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain almost to the absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited. About twenty minutes he waited, and then a great man in a long coat, with a necklace turned towards his ears, rushed across the street. He went straight to the man who was waiting. ""Is it you, Bob?"" he asked, dubious. ""Is it you, Jimmy Wells?"" cried the man at the door. ""Bless my heart!"" cried the new arrival, taking both hands of the other with his. ""It is Bob, sure that fate was. I was sure that I would find you here if you were still alive."
"It seems that no one knows how to waltz, but it has no consequence: there is music, and they dance, each as he wants, as before to sing. Most of them prefer the ""two steps"", especially the young ones, with whom it is fashion. Elderly people have dances of the house, strange and complicated steps that they perform with a serious solemnity. Some do not dance at all, but hold hands of the other and allow the undisciplined joy of the movement to express themselves with their feet. Among them, Jokubas Szedvilas and his wife, Lucija, who, together, keep the delicatessen store, and consume almost as much as they sell it; they are too big to dance, but they stand in the middle of the ground, holding one another fast in their arms, slowly lurking side by side and grinning seraphically, an image of ecstasy without teeth and perceptive."
"I had now seen all the birds, but none of them were as beautiful as the black birds. I didn't want to be like any of them; I wanted to be a black bird, a real black bird. It wasn't possible. So I decided to settle for my lot, as I had the heart of a black bird even if I wasn't black. A large flock of blacks lived on the edge of a cornfield. I went to see them and asked them to let me be their help. ""I'm just a white black bird,"" I said, ""but I have the heart of a real black bird."" They let me stay. I waited on them early and late, bringing straw to make nests and tender worms for the black birds. The old birds were kind to me, and I started to be happy."
"One morning, a little rabbit sat on a bank. He swiped his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony. A concert came along the road; he was led by Mr. McGregor, and next to him sat Mrs. McGregor in his best hood. As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slipped into the road, and left – with a jump, a jump, a jump – to appeal to his relationships, who lived in the woods at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden. This wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the cleanest and sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and cousins—Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter."
"The relationship, between the reader and the writer, between the son and father, may have existed in Queen Elizabeth's day, but it is far too close to be true to ours. The greatest that any writer can hope of his readers now is that they must consent to consider themselves nephews, and even then he would expect only a more or less civil refusal of most of them. Indeed, if he had reached a certain age, he would have observed that nephews, as a social class, no longer read at all, and that there is only one familiar recorded example of a nephew who reads his uncle. The exception tends rather to support the rule, because he needed a Macaulay to produce, and two volumes to record it. Finally, the meter does not allow it. One cannot say: ""Who reads me, when I am ashes, is my nephew in desire."
"One of the birds fell to the song, and the other said, ""Who told you to sing?"" He answered, ""The flowers and the bees told me. The blue sky told me, and you told me. ""When did I say to sing?"" asked his companion. Whenever you brought soft grass for the nest, he replied. Every time your soft wings were extinguished again for the hair and feathers to line him."" Then his companion asked, ""What are you singing?"" ""I sing about everything,"" he replied. ""I sing because I am happy."" By and by five little spotted eggs were in the nest, and the mother bird asked, ""Is there anything in the world like my eggs?"" A week or two later, the mother said, ""Oh, what do you think happened?"
"Bull, John, an end, big, American-Benef who lives in an island infested with suffragette somewhere in the North Atlantic. Born several hundred years ago and begins to show his age. Is attached to the sea and says he has a beautiful fleet. It has had years, especially 1812. B. has had difficulties with a son who wishes to leave the paternal protection. Is without fear except in the face of a hunger strike, the Pankhurst family, and the thoughts of Germany. Patronizes a costly social organization known as the royal family, or a welcoming committee for American inheritance, which also devotes buildings, poses for stamps, postcards, films and raises princesses from Wales for articles of magazines and coronation. B. is an English-style monitor; wears a monocle, spats, 'i'at, cane, pipe, dreadful accents."
"The missionary was young and she came from the North. Her eyebrows were straight, her nose was quite high, and her eyes were clear and grey. The upper lip of her small mouth was so short that the teeth just under her were never completely hidden. It was the mouth of a child and she gave to the face, with all her strength and great purpose, a particular pathos that no soul in this small mountain town had the power to see or feel. A yellow mule was attached to the fence of rickety in front of her and she stood on the hollow of a small white frame house with an elm between her teeth and gloves on her hands, which were white and looked strong. The mule wore a man's saddle, but no matter what, the streets were full of yellow swimming pools, the mud was deep, and she was on Becky Day's sick bed."
"There was dust everywhere, it was a world of red-hot dust. He was lying on the roads where the traces of a hard wheel marked them; but the whole long plain was also dust. Neither grass nor anything green were shown, and the dry salt died, eaten by the sheep until it looked like broken peas, was dust colour on the dance horizon of this thirsty world. For seven months and a week, by Wilson's almanac, there had been no rain, and what the dew had fallen hot air drunk when the violent sun had risen. And now even the small fenced garden of Warribah showed no sign of greenery. The water was precious, and every day the wind of the north was drinking the water holes drier and drier. But, although the world of Warribah was desolate was brown, in the roots of the grass and the simple sticks of the saline were nourishing enough to keep life in the sheep's need, and they had to go to the station."
"A very great and strong man, dressed in rich clothes, went down to meet Theseus. On his arms were bracelets of gold, and around his neck a necklace of jewels; and he went forth, bowing courteously, and holding his two hands, and said, ""Welcome, beautiful youth, to these mountains; happy will I meet you! For what greater pleasure for a good man than to entertain strangers? But I see that you are tired. Go up to my castle, and rest a little."" ""I thank you,"" said Thesée; ""but I am in a hurry to go up into the valley."" ""Alas, you have wandered away from the good way, and you cannot reach the end of your journey until the night, for there are many kilometres of mountains between you and her, and steep passages, and dangerous cliffs after the fall of the night."
"Even in the days before the arrival of my teacher, I used to feel along the square hedges of steep boxwoods, and, guided by the sense of smell, would find the first violets and lilies. Here too, after a moment of shyness, I went to find comfort and hide my warm face in the fresh leaves and grass. What a joy to lose myself in this garden of flowers, to wander joyfully from one place to another, until, suddenly coming on a beautiful vine, I recognized it by its leaves and flowers, and knew that it was the vine that covered the summer house tumble at the end of the garden! Here too, were clematis trainants, draconian jesamines, and some rare sweet flowers called lis butterflies, because their fragile petals resembled the wings of butterflies."
"All that a man realizes and all that he does not realize is the direct result of his own thoughts. In a precisely ordained universe, where the loss of equipment would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. One man's weakness and strength, purity and uncleanness are his own, and not those of another man; they are brought by himself, and not by another; and they can only be modified by himself, and never by another. His condition is also his, and not that of another man. His suffering and happiness are evolved from within. As he thinks, so he is; as he continues to think, so he remains. A strong man cannot help a weaker if this weaker is not willing to be helped, and even then the weak man must become strong of himself; he must, by his own efforts, develop the strength that he admires in another."
"Gluck was very puzzled by the behavior of his guest; it was such a strange mixture of freshness and humility. He turned to the rope meditatively for another five minutes. ""This sheep looks very pleasant,"" said the old man. ""Can't you give me a little?"" ""Impossible, sir,"" said Gluck.""""I am very hungry,"" continued the old man; ""I didn't eat anything yesterday or today. ""They certainly couldn't miss a little of the scam!"" He spoke with such a melancholy tone that he melted Gluck's heart."" They promised me a slice today, sir,"" he said; ""I can give you that, but not a little more."" ""He's a good boy,"" said the old man. ""Gluck then warmed up a plate and sharpened a knife."
"Horatio Bridge, my father's friend, was a handbag in the navy and lived in Augusta, Maine, his official residence being in Portsmouth. He had kept closer contact with the novelist than any of his other friends since their graduation, and he had been of the first believer in his future literary fame. Thus, when the letter Scarlet shone prominently in the firmament of the land-book, it was his triumphant ""I-told-you-so"" who was among the first to be heard. And when my father launched for a place more sympathetic than Salem to live, it was at Bridge that he asked for suggestions. He stipulated that the place had to be somewhere along the coast of New England. If this wish of his was fulfilled, he could have made great differences. Hawthorne had always lived in the sight and sound of the Atlantic, on which his ancestors had sailed so often between India and the port of Salem."
"Bobby was not quite sure that he was awake, but when he opened his eyes, there was the blue sky, with the soft and white clouds drifting through him, the tall pine waving its spicy branches on the head, and beyond, the sunlight on the water of the pond. Bobby heard voices that spoke softly. ""It's a good specimen,"" said a voice. ""Look how strong and strong he is!"" ""I wonder who it is, and what he found,"" thought Bobby. ""I wish it wasn't so hard to keep my eyes open."" However, he made a great effort and lifted his heavy lids. At first, he didn't see anything."
"""My children will love the meadows, the forests and the seas,"" he thought, ""but the mountains look dark and cold. They are very dear to me, but how will I make my children go to them and learn to love them?"" Long time the great Spirit thought of the mountains. Finally, he made many small bright stones. Some were red, some blues, some greens, some yellows, and others shone in all the beautiful colors of the rainbow. ""All my children will love what is beautiful,"" he thought, ""and if I hide the bright stones in the seams of the rocks of the mountains, men will come and find them, and they will learn to love my mountains."" When the stones were made and the great Spirit looked at their beauty, he said, ""I will not hide you all in the seams of the rocks. Some of you will be out in the sun, so that the little children who cannot go to the mountain will see your colors."""
"To what extent strange condiments, herbs and other seasonings have been used, as well as to what task the human stomach has been subjected to, will be apparent from a recipe, given by the same authority, for a thick sauce for a boiled chicken: ""Put the following ingredients in a mortar: anise seed, dried mint, and lazer root (similar to asafotetida); cover them with vinegar; add dates; pour in garum, oil and a small quantity of mustard seeds; reduce everything to a good thickness with hot red wine; then pour the same on your chicken, which should previously be boiled in anise seeds water.""As for old wines, let us be duly grateful for the progress of winemaking, and grateful that we can read from them, rather than share it, to find the Katzenjammer the following morning."
"The Government of the Canadian Dominion is very oppressive. Mining laws are very arbitrary and strictly enforced. A person who wants to seek gold must first obtain a minor's licence, paying ten dollars for it. If something is discovered, and he wants to find a claim, he goes to the office of the recorder, declares his affairs, and he is told to call back. Meanwhile, men are sent to examine the locality and if something of value is found, the man who wants to register the claim is said to be already located. The officials seize it. The man has no means to verify whether the land was properly located, and therefore has no reparation. If the claim is considered poor, he can locate it by paying a tax of fifteen dollars. Half of all the mining land is reserved for the crown, one quarter or more is swallowed by corrupt officials, and a meagre part is left to the daring miners who, through difficulties and death, develop the mines and open the country."
"Ms. Lydia was an old girl of thirty-five years old, with well-drawn and tight hair that made her look even older. The old one, too, was; but the glory of the antebellum did not shine from her as she did from the Major. She had a common sense, and it was she who managed the family's finances, and met all the comers when there were bills to pay. The Major considered the boarding and washing bills to be despicable nuisances. They continued to come so long and so often. Why, the Major wanted to know, could they not be deposited and paid in a lump sum at a certain convenient time—say when the Anecdotes and the Reminiscences had been published and paid for? Miss Lydia would quietly continue to sew and said: ""We will pay so long as the money will last, and perhaps they will have to put it in bloc."""
"In Denver, there was an influx of passengers in the buses of B. & M. Express. In a bus, there was a very pretty young woman dressed in an elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveller. Among the newcomers, there were two young men, one of a beautiful presence with a bold face, frank and in a way; the other a person with a gluttoned face, strongly built and coarsely dressed. Both were handcuffed together. When they passed the coach's driveway, the only vacant seat offered was an inverted seat in front of the attractive young woman. Here, the related couple sat down. The young woman's gaze fell on them with a distant and rapid disinterest; then with a beautiful smile brightening her face and a tender pink tintling her rounded cheeks, she held a small grey hand. When she spoke, full, gentle, and deliberate, proclaimed that her owner was accustomed to speaking and being heard."
"There was clearly nothing to do but flop on the little couch and scream. Della did it. This instills the moral reflection that life is made of sobs, sniffs and smiles, with predominant sniffs. Although the housewife gradually subsides from the first stage to the second, look at the house. A furnished apartment at $8 a week. He did not beg exactly description, but he certainly had this word on the search for the beggars' team. In the vestibule below was a mailbox in which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring."
"Her wife did not answer. She looked at the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, looking indecisively at the house, seemed to try to enter into her mind. In mental connection with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and was wearing a silk hat of brilliant novelty. Three times he stopped at the door, then walked again. The fourth time he held his hand on it, and then with a sudden resolution, he opened it and went up the way. At the same time, Mrs. White placed her hands behind her, and rushed over the ropes of her apron, put this useful item of clothing under the cushion of her chair. She brought the stranger, who seemed uncomfortable, into the room. He looked furtively, and listened with concern, as the old lady had vaporized for the appearance of the room, and her husband, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden."
"He had lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other among the potatoes. After losing them, he ran on four legs and went away faster, so that I think he could have gone completely if he had unfortunately not run into a net of goose, and had been caught by the big buttons of his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, brand new. Peter went for loss, and shed great tears; but his sobs were heard by sparrows of friends, who flew towards him in great excitement, and implored him to exercise. Mr. McGregor came with a sieve, which he intended to jump on Peter's top; but Peter just in time left his jacket behind."
"I have shopping to do, business to settle, and I have to go here and there about the city. Sirocco, of course, does everything to be gray, but under any sky it is dispiritual to note the changes in Naples. Lo sventramento (the deembowelling) continues, and the regions are transformed. It is a good thing, I suppose, that the wide Corso Umberto I. should cut off a path through the old Pendino; but what contrast between this picturesque native and the cosmopolitan vulgarity that usurped its place! ""Napoli does not go!"" I pass the Santa Lucia with fallen eyes, my memories of ten years ago to strive against the dulness of today. The port, hence the one that started for Capri, is filled; the sea has been driven to a distance without hope beyond a desert of dust-pates."
"The immense bonfires where fifty or a hundred cords of wood peeled, split, broken, were piled around an old giant by a single lightning stroke is another great spectacle in the night. The light is so great that I found that I could read the impression common to three hundred meters of them, and the illumination of the circle of looking trees is indescribably impressive. Other large fires, roaring and inflamed like waterfalls, were blazing on the upper sides of the trees on slopes of hills, against which limbs broken by heavy snow had rolled, while branches raised above, thrown and shaken by the rising air current, seemed to be tearing themselves apart. Perhaps the most amazing phenomenon of all was the rapid death of children like Sequoias only a century or two of age."
"After two years of training, he went to sea, and entered the regions so known by his imagination, found them strangely sterile of adventure. He made many journeys. He experienced the magical monotony of existence between heaven and water: he had to carry the criticism of men, the abuses of the sea, and the prosaic severity of the daily task which gives bread, but whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work. This reward escaped him. Yet, he could not return, because there is nothing more attractive, disenchanting and enslaving than life at sea. Moreover, his prospects were good. He was gentlemanly, stable, traviable, with a thorough knowledge of his duties; and in time, when very young, he became the main companion of a beautiful ship, without ever having been tested by these events of the sea which showed in the light of the day the inner value of a man, the edge of his temperament, and the fiber of his own affairs; it revealed the secret quality of his own resistance, and not only the truth of his own."
"After walking for about a quarter of an hour, the army stopped in front of an anthill, the home of a colony of small black ants. They fought to meet the reds, and, to Huber's surprise, a short but fierce fight took place at the foot of the hill. A small number of blacks fought bravely until the end, but the others fled soon, distressed by panic, through the doors furthest from the battlefield, carrying some of their young people. They seemed to know that it was the young ants that the invaders were looking for. The red warriors quickly made their way into the small town and returned, loaded with children of the blacks. Wearing their living loot, the kidnappers left the town and started to their house, where Huber followed them."
"He took her to the door, said goodbye and went away. After hearing her sedative voice all day long, and, closing her eyes, she instantly had a vision of her black beard. She took a great taste. And it was evident that he had been impressed by her too; for shortly after, an elderly woman, a distant acquaintance, came to take a cup of coffee with her. As soon as the woman was sitting at the table, she began to talk about Pustovalov — as it was good, what a stable man, and any woman could be happy to get her as a husband. Three days later, Pustovalov himself paid a visit. He remained only ten minutes, and spoke only a little, but Olenka fell in love with him, and fell so desperately in love that she did not sleep all night and burned like fever."
"A week had passed since they had met. It was a holiday. It was sordid inside, while in the street the wind turned the dust and turned, and blew the hats of the people. It was a thirsty day, and Gurov often went into the pavilion, and pressed Anna Sergeyevna to have syrup and water or ice. We didn't know what to do with himself. In the evening, when the wind had fallen a little, they went out on the groyone to see the steam entering. There were many people walking in the harbour; they had gathered to welcome one, bringing bouquets. And two peculiarities of a well dressed crowd of Yalta were very visible: the elderly ladies were dressed as young, and there were many generals."
"The need to confine attention to study alone leads to the selection of one or more of the sons of a family as the beneficiary of an education. The chosen one is dressed in the best style that his family situation will allow, his little pick carefully attached with a red rope, and it is provided, as we have seen, with a copy of the Cent Surnames and the Trimetric Classic. This young Confucianist is the bud and prototype of adult scholar. His twin brother, who was not chosen for this high vocation, wanders on the village all summer in the costume of the Garden of Eden, collecting fuel, swimming in the mud hole of the village, occupied when he must be busy, idle when he can be idle. He can be incomparably more useful to his family than the other, but to the extent that education goes he is only a ""wild"" boy."
"What Buddhism has not given, the Shintoism offered in abundance. Such fidelity to the sovereign, such reverence for ancestral memory, and such filial piety which are not taught by any other belief, have been inculcated by Shinto doctrines, giving passivity to the otherwise arrogant character of the samurai. Shinto theology has no place for the dogma of ""original sin."" On the contrary, it believes in the innate goodness and purity of God of the human soul, adoring it as the odytum from which the divine oracles are proclaimed. Everyone has observed that Shinto shrines are clearly lacking in objects and instruments of worship, and that a clear mirror hanging in the sanctuary forms the essential part of its furnishing. The presence of this article is easy to explain: it characterizes the human heart, which, when perfectly plecid and clear, reflects the very image of Deity."
"One evening, when I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard voices coming up, and there was the nephew and uncle walking along the bank. I was resting my head on my arm, and I had almost lost myself in a dove, when someone said to me in the ear: ""I am as harmless as a little child, but I do not like to be dictated to. Am I the director — or is it not? I was ordered to send him there. It is incredible.""... I realized that both were standing on the shore next to the front part of the steamboat, just below my head."
"The worst thing we can say about him is that he did not represent his class. He was a sailor, but he was also a wanderer, while most sailors, if one can express it, led a sedentary life. Their spirits are of the order of stay, and their house is always with them — the ship; and their country also — the sea. One ship is very similar to another, and the sea is always the same. In the immutability of their environment foreign coasts, foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a somewhat disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious for a sailor unless it is the sea itself, which is the mistress of its existence and as inscrutable as Destiny."
"Our blades had not crossed earlier than I knew that in this last encounter I had to need all the whims of my talent, of all my intelligence, of all my audacity and of all my strength. I had met my equal, and he came to her freshly and I fell. I tightened my teeth and prayed with all my heart; I put my face before me, and I thought that if I should miss her what terrible fate she could come, and I fought like I had never fought before. The sound of the surf became a roar in my ears, the sun a fire of intolerable light; the blue above and around seemed suddenly under my feet too. We were fighting high in the air, and we had fought it so for centuries. I knew that he was not making any thrust I was not going away, no feint I could interpret. I knew that my eye was faster to see, my brain to conceive, and my hand to execute than ever before; but it was everywhere in the forest, I was the same man who knew that I was in the garden, and I was in the garden."
"The normal and characteristic occupations of the class in this mature phase of its life history are in some way the same as in its previous days. These occupations are governmental, war, sports and devotee observances. People improperly given to difficult theoretical kindnesses may consider these occupations to be still incidentally and indirectly ""productive""; but it should be noted that the question in hand is that the ordinary and ostensible motive of the leisure class in the exercise of these occupations is certainly not an increase of wealth through productive effort. At this stage as at any other cultural stage, government and war are, at least in part, prosecuted for the financial gain of those who engage in it; but it is obtained by the honourable method of seizure and conversion. These occupations are of the nature of predator, not productive, employment. Something similar can be said of hunting, but with a difference."
"An intelligent invention, born in France, is a lifebuoy that was used on the Seine in Paris. People falling into the water at night often lose their lives because it is impossible to know where they are; or, if any rescue device is thrown into the darkness, they drown frequently before they can find it. This small device consists of a combination of a buoy with an electric light; when the buoy is thrown into the water, the light is automatically lit. In the context of this invention, life savers in Paris use a hook that we illustrate. This has an electric light near the end in the oval space; this light allows to grapple for people who have been able to descend under the water. We also received from France the story of an invention in the form of a bicycle lamp in which acetylene is burned."
"This is done by closing the two ends of each section of the canal with doors; a second pair of doors is placed a short distance beyond it, and the space between them is called a ""lock"". If a ship is to be brought into a section of the canal higher than the section from which it came, it enters the lock; the water is then left in that lock of the upper level by opening a water door until it has entered sufficiently to float the ship to the level of the upper section of the canal; the doors before the ship is opened and it passes into the new section. If it is to be driven to a lower section, the opposite of this operation accomplishes it: the water is left out until it is at the lower level."
"Several ships have been built for Brazil and Chile, and now that they are almost finished, it is said that the Spanish Government, by agreeing to pay huge sums of money, is trying to secure them. Chile does not seem to give up a combat ship just now, as the relations between that country and the Argentine Republic are very tense. There is no doubt, however, that Spain is increasing the efficiency of its navy, which is beginning to take on very formidable proportions. The United States is also busy putting the old ships in good condition, and rushing the work on those that are under construction. The Government, it is reported, has the details of the construction of many ships now being built on the other side. One of the reports was that the United States had an option on each ship under construction in Europe, except, of course, the ships under construction for Spain. This report, however, has not been confirmed. For the United States to have the option on one ship, it means that no other country will be allowed to buy that ship unless the United States decides that it will."
"Among the English expeditions, the most important for us in America were Henry Hudson's. He made his first voyage in 1607, representing the Muscovy Company of England. He explored the coast of Greenland on this voyage, and again in 1608; on his third voyage, he explored the coasts of North America and discovered the Hudson River. At that time, he was employed by the Dutch East India Company. In 1610, his efforts were crowned with success, and he discovered what is known as Hudson Bay. From then on, the voyage after the voyage was made, largely by Englishmen, and the knowledge of geography grew every year, with each captain gathering new information."
"If it had not been very strong, there was little doubt that the Foscolia would have cut it in half; the ship's frames, however, were so well constructed that they, with the protection deck, prevented more serious damage. Navy officers were very pleased to see how the ship had resisted the collision; they said that if the Columbia had been a ship like the large marine ships, nothing would have prevented it from sinking with the ship that struck it. When the Columbia officer saw that a collision was inevitable, he gave the order ""Full speed in advance""; he was very lucky that he had done so, otherwise the Foscolia would have struck in the middle of his ships; and the damage had to be very serious, because the water compartments in that part of the ship were large and when they were filled could have capsized it."
"The Massachusetts colony had a tree on its flag. South Carolina had a rattlesnake on a yellow flag and under the snake the motto: ""Don't walk on me."" New York had a white flag with a beaver on it; Rhode Island had a white flag with a blue anchor. Many variations of the ""stars and stripes"" are found in the flags used during the early years of the Revolution. Some have red and white stripes, with the field (where the stars are in the flag we all know) like the British flag field – red, white and blue lines that cross. This drawing in the corner of a flag is called its ""jack"", and is often used alone. In 1777, Congress stated that the flag should have thirteen horizontal stripes and thirteen white stars on a blue field, each representing one of the thirteen states."
"""The General's Double,"" by Captain King, and ""Trooper Ross and Signal Butte,"" by the same author, come to us from the press of J. B. Lippincott Company. The first is a capital history of the civil war, the plot being based on the remarkable resemblance between two men in the Union army. He has all the charm of the works of this favorite author. The second book contains two stories, the heroes of the two being boys. The first, ""Trooper Ross,"" describes the adventures of an officer's son, his exciting experiences with native Americans on the plains as a little boy, taking part in the boarding school-school later; then, not getting his admission to West Point, he works his way through the ranks of his commission. ""Signal Butte"" covers a series of exciting adventures in Arizona, in which two boys are central figures."
"In this warm climate, it is not too pleasant to be on board a ship, even with plenty of space to move; but when the men on the transports are crowded, there is no end of discomfort. Throughout Friday afternoon and evening, the men worked at their camp, and were quite tired when they were ordered to go for the night. All the precautions were taken to avoid a surprise, although no attack was expected. Saturday, the men continued their work, which was finely completed and almost finished, when late in the afternoon, while a large number of men were carrying water on the hill, and others, who had worked hard all day, were swimming in the bay, suddenly heard the acute crack of the Mauser rifles, and the men knew that the Spaniards were there."
"Ekaterina Ivanovna sat down and struck the piano with both hands, and then smote herself with all her strength, and then again and again, her shoulders and her bosom trembled. She strung obstinately on the same notes, and it seemed that she did not go until she had hammered the keys in the piano. The living room was filled with din; everything resonated; the floor, the ceiling, the furniture... Ekaterina Ivanovna played a difficult passage, interesting simply because of her difficulty, long and monotonous, and Startsev, listening, painted stones that fell on a steep hill and would fall, and he wanted them to go away; and at the same time Ekaterina Ivanovna, dew of violent, strong and vigorous exercise, with a wick of hair that fell on her forehead, attracted him a lot."
"It was Saturday night; the sun went down, the workers came into the crowd of the factory at the station, and they bowed towards the car in which Korolyov was driving. And he was charmed by the evening, the farms and villas on the road, and the birches, and the quiet atmosphere all around, when the fields and the woods and the sun seemed to be preparing, as the workers now on the eve of the holidays, to rest, and perhaps to pray.. He was born and had grown up in Moscow; he did not know the country, and he had never taken any interest in the factories, or was inside, but he had the opportunity to read about the factories, and had been in the houses of the manufacturers and had spoken to them; and when he saw a factory far or near, he always thought of how quiet and peaceful he was outside, but inside he was always sure to be impenetrable ignorance and selfish on the side of the owners, laborious, unhealthy toil on the side of the workers, squabling, vermin, vodka."
"The origin of the hatred between Colonna and Orsini is unknown, for the archives of the former have not yet shed light on the subject, and those of them were almost entirely destroyed by fire in the last century. In 1305, Pope Clement the fifth was elected pope in Perugia. He was a Frenchman, and was archbishop of Bordeaux, the candidate of Philip the Fair, whose guardian had been a Colonna, and he was chosen by the opposing factions of two cardinals of Orsini because the people of Perugia were tired of a quarrel that had lasted eleven months, and had adopted the practical and always infallible expedient to deliberately die the conclave to a vote. Muratori calls this a scandalous and illegal election, which brought the ruin of Italy and struck a memorable blow to the power of the Holy See. Although not a great man, Philip the Fair was one of the most skillful who ever lived. Before the election, he had made his bishop swear on the Sacred Host to accept his conditions, without expressing them all."
"After some time, the polished rock walls of the tree became of the same solemnity. Clewe stopped taking notes. He tried to imagine what he was going to get to the bottom; it would be a kind of cave, he thought, in which his shell had made an opening. He began to imagine what kind of cave he would be, and at what height the roof was from the ground. Clewe then suddenly wondered if his gardener had remembered what he had said to him about the flower beds in front of the house; he wanted some changes that Margaret had suggested. He tried to keep the mind on the flower beds, but he moved away from the cave below. He thought of the danger of entering an underground water plane, where he would have drowned; but he knew that it was a stupid idea. If the shell had crossed underground reservoirs, the water of these would have been exhausted, and before it reached the bottom of the tree would have become clouded."
"Then came the night of the first fallen star. We saw it early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere. Hundreds had to see it, and take it for an ordinary falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish striations behind it that shines for a few seconds. Denning, our greatest authority over meteorites, declared that the height of his first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell on earth about a hundred miles east of him. I was at home at that time and I wrote in my study; and although my French windows opposite Ottershaw and the blind was standing (for I loved in those days to look at the night sky), I could not see any of it."
"No author can really say more than Louisa Alcott that her works are a revelation of herself. She rarely looked for the material of her stories in old chronicles, or foreign adventures. Her capital was her own life and experiences and those of others directly around her; and her own brazen and well-recalled fantasies were sure to find the receptive enjoyment in the minds of other girls. It is therefore impossible to fully understand Miss Alcott's works without a knowledge of her own life and experiences. By inheritance and education, she had rich and special gifts; and her life was one of the few advantages, as well as to try out difficulties. She herself of the most true and frank nature, she gave us the opportunity to know her without disguise; and that's how I will try to portray her, showing what influences have acted on her through life, and how she faithfully and fully accomplished all the circumstances of her duties. Fortunately, I can let her speak mainly for herself."
"The course, after leaving the ice, led from the river from a long easy slope up to the level above; and at the upper end, bowed a little abruptly around the Old Fort. The only condition attached to the race was, that the teams should start from scratch, make the turn of the Fort, and finish at zero. There were no vexing rules as to faults. The man who made the mistake would find it necessary to count with the crowd, which was considered a sufficient guarantee for a fair and square race. Due to the dangers of the course, the result depended on the skill of the drivers as much as the speed of the teams. The points of danger were at the bend around the Old Fort, and at a small ravine leading to the river, on which the road passed through a long round wooden bridge or a pavement bridge."
"A typewriter can write much faster than any pen — and the work it does has the advantage of being easy to read, while very few people write a clear and readable hand. In the office work a large part of the writing to do is to make entries in books and copy into registers. All this had to be done by hand, and of course it took a lot more time to do. By this new invention book can be kept and the entries copied with the same cleanliness and speed of an ordinary typewriter. The great difficulty in making a machine to do this job properly was that it was not possible to move the paper back as it does in the typewriters in general."
"Another ingenious postal device that has just been tested is the letter recording scheme yourself. The first thing to do is to put a ten cent coin in the slot. The room opens a small recording window, and reveals a stamp on which you write the address of the registered letter, as well as an opening through which the letter must be abandoned. The letter must first have been stamped with a two cent stamp. After the letter is posted, the sender pulls a handle until a gong rings and a receipt is then pushed to the sender. This receipt is in fact the second half of the order he wrote himself. As soon as the receipt is given the machine locks, and nothing will unlock it only from a cool piece in the slot."
"A cyclone and a wave of tides have visited the island of Leyte, which is part of the Philippine group, and have done a lot of damage, sweeping a vast area of countries and killing thousands of people. A wave of tide, or, more precisely, a wave of earthquake, is an extraordinarily high wave, supposed to be formed by the disturbance caused by an earthquake in the bed of the sea. The action of the earthquake makes the waters withdraw from the shores, and gather in a powerful mass, which suddenly turns and advances on the shore in a huge wave of enormous height. This wave sweeps on the earth until it has spent its strength, when the waters rush once again towards the sea. The force of such a wave is so great that it destroys everything on its way, tearing rocks and blocks, and carrying them inside with it."
"This is an idea that will find favor to all women who have long hair and dread along, fatigue drying process, and misery and tangles that are part of the first comb after drying hair. It is an electric hair dryer, partly combed and partly brush. It is connected to an electric wire that heats a sliding plate inside. The hair dryer is passed over the hair, smoothing and removing tangles, and drying at the same time by means of the heated plate inside. It can be easily adapted to each house where electricity is used, as a small wire attached to the lights will do the necessary work. The hair dryer is carefully insulated, and there is no danger that the user will receive an electric shock. The hair dryer should become a favorite toilet item. The softness and silkiness of the hair is greatly improved by a constant washing, and yet there are many women to whom the mixture of damp locks means a safe cold in the head and sore throat."
"If one of our boys and girls found their bike saddles as uncomfortable as your editor found it, they will be delighted to learn that there is a reasonable and comfortable saddle. The pleasure of riding on your wheel for miles without feeling your saddle can only be enjoyed by those who find themselves having a saddle that fits; the big problem is that very few people adapt to the average saddle; and since the saddle cannot be adjusted, the perfect comfort is not possible. With this new saddle, the case is different, because it can be adjusted to fit a large or small person exactly. It also has a contrivance that allows the parts to climb and descend so that there is no friction whatsoever."
"We have received a very attractive little book called ""Uncle Robert's Visit"", which is the third part of the book series entitled ""Uncle Robert's Geography"". It is published by Mr. Appleton in their series of home reading books, and presents the study of nature and geographical knowledge in the most attractive form, being woven in a story of ""Uncle Robert's Visit"" on the farm. This particular uncle, like some others we have known, was a fund of information and a source of pleasure for nephews and nieces. He went with them in fields and woods, and, without forcing them in any way, thus ordered the conversation they learned a lot about nature on each trip. These uncles are treasures, and those who can't always have them with them, to read another uncle in this attractive form is charming."
"It was in 450 B.C., at the beginning of the summer, and Phidias, who had worked all day long, walked quietly through the streets of Athens. Passing through the Agora (or market square), he managed to lift his eyes, and saw a young girl about thirteen years of age sitting beside him. His face was pure beauty; his head was graciously placed on his shoulders; his expression was sad herself. She looked poor and distressed. She moved forward and begged to help; and there was something in her way, as well as in her face, which made Phidias stop and listened to him. ""My father is sick,"" she said, ""and he cannot do his job, and so we can't feed him; nothing to make him good and strong. If I could only do his job for him, I shouldn't care; then I don't beg him."
"What is this noble contempt for the appearances that characterize American men? Our climate, as some suggest, or discouragement to all of us from being millionaires? It comes more likely from an absence with us from military training that goes so far towards licking the young men in shape. I will never forget the surprise on the face of a French stateman to whom I once expressed my sympathy for his country, working under the burden of such a vast standing army. He replied: ""The financial burden is doubtless great; but you have others. Witness your pension expenses. With us the money drawn from the people is used in such a way that they are of priceless value. We take the young farm hobbledehoy-hand or mechanic, ignorant, manic, unclean as it may be, and let's turn him at the end of three years with his regiment, self-respecting and manic, with habits of cleanliness and obedience, having acquired a turnover, and a love of order that will cling to him and serve him all his life."
"About a year ago, Croton's water, which is used in New York City, was found unclean. A commission was commissioned to examine Croton's water. This meant that they had to look at the small streams, streams, rivers and lakes, which provided water to our aqueduct, and see what the problem was. They found that along the shores of these streams and lakes, in villages and outside the country, a large number of houses and slums had been built, whose occupants used to throw all sorts of waste into the water, making it unfit to drink."
"In England, we have recently patented a system of making buttons, combs, brushes, billiard balls, etc. The bony buttons and items of this kind, which we use so far, have been made of waste from the butchers. This new process will only need milk. Anyone who knows anything about dairy work knows what it is. It is the thick bitter milk that is found under the cream of butter. This lopper milk is made in cottage cheese, and many people, in the manufacture of their cottage cheese, the support for a while on the fire to thicken. Woe to the dairy woman who lets it stay too long! It becomes like small buttons of rubber, that nothing will relax. When we try to bite it the teeth bounces. This is the type of material that is the hardest. Mr. Callander, the Englishman who invented the milk buttons, must have had a meeting with some of this cottage cheese, and his difficulties in chewing it did not have to ask himself for anything else."
"Blondin, a famous tight-rope walker, died in London at the age of seventy-three years. The performance that made him known was the crossing of Niagara Falls on the tight rope. Blondin was a Frenchman, his father having been one of Napoleon's soldiers. He was told that at the age of five he saw an acrobat occurring on a tight rope. He was so pleased with what he saw, that he returned home, stretched a rope between two poles, and, as soon as his mother was off the road, took his father's fishing rod, and, using it as a balancing pole, made his first appearance as a tight-rope walker. He was trained for an acrobat and a tight walk, and came to this country with a troupe of pantomimists."
"In the first place, it looks like an ordinary pair of scissors. But when you open them to cut anything, you get the first surprise: one of the blades is marked in inches, half-inches, quarters, eighths, and sixteenths. Then when you are ready for the wonders these shears must show, you find that on a handle is a hammer head, and they can be used as a hammer. Near the hammer head a screwdriver is arranged. At the point of the shears is an owl for boring holes; and, the most practical of all, the scissors when they are open form a perfect carpenter square. This wonderful tool was invented by Benjamin Ford, of Newcastle, Maine. Any boy who has such a pair of shears, and a screw paper in his pocket, can build and make to his heart, and the happy mother who has this tool on his work board is made forever with such a pair of shears, and a screw paper in his pocket."
"A country is different from an individual in the fact that there are certain expenses that are not exactly necessary, and yet must be borne, for the honor of the country. A man who is in monetary difficulty can reduce his expenses to the simple cost of food, house and clothing. In this way, a man is better than a country. But, on the other hand, a man can only earn so much money; he cannot force people to buy his goods, or to pay him better prices; he must do his best with what he can earn; while a country can, through taxes, force people to give him the money he needs, and therefore it is better than an individual."
"Great floods are reported from the Mississippi Valley. Part of the country equal in size to the entire state of Missouri is now under water, and steamboats are rushing into what was once agricultural land, aiding the unhappy families that were taken by the floods. Mississippi, the largest river on our continent, flows through what is known as the plain of the Gulf Coast. The plain of the Gulf Coast is formed by the valley between the great mountain ranges that make the frame of our country. Mississippi with its tributaries drains all the enormous expanse of land that lies between these three main mountain ranges."
"A book has been invented to carry fish hooks, and it promises to be of great use to all those who find pleasure in the soft art of fishing. It is a book arranged a bit like a wallet. At one end is a strong leather pocket for flies, then stretched through it are four slings. Each sled has a number of slits in it. At the end in front of the pocket is the first sled, and in the slits in this sled the hooks are placed. The short line attached to the hook is carried to the next sled, and slid carefully in a slit opposite to the one holding the hook. The line is carried on another sled to be finally anchored in one closer to the pocket. When the book is closed the slings adapt to each other, and the hooks are kept in place and therefore cannot be entangled."
"On the third day of the new year, newspaper readers in two hemispheres were first made aware of the real importance of this unusual appearance in the heavens. ""A planetary collision,"" a London newspaper directed the news, and proclaimed Duchaine's opinion that this strange new planet would probably be in collision with Neptune. The main authors expanded on the subject; so that in most capitals of the world on January 3, there was a expectation, as vague as an imminent phenomenon in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset around the globe, thousands of men turned their eyes towards the sky, as they had always been. Until the dawn of London and Pollux and the stars above the sky were pale."
"I was in Athens when the age of Crown Prince George, the brave and handsome young Greek whom we hear so much about, was celebrated. The streets, from the palace to the church where the ceremonies were to take place, were very beautiful with triumphal arches. Rich tapestries floated from the windows throughout the way, and the flags of all the nations — among them our dear Stars and Stripes — were joyfully awakened to the breeze. The city was full of soldiers. Among them the Greek mountaineers in their picturesque white linen suit, composed of tunics with long, fluid sleeves, and skirts stuffed so full and starched that they stood up like the skirts of a circus runner. Their long pointed shoes, which turned at the feet like a toboggan, had large red rosettes on the same points. Their caps were brilliantly colored, and a long cup fell from the crown to their shoulders."
"His father, who also bore Franz's name, was the son of a peasant, who was studying in Vienna, and became assistant to his brother, a schoolmaster. He married Elizabeth Vitz, who had served as a cook in Vienna. Franz Peter Schubert was the thirteenth in a family of fourteen children. His love of music was evident when he was very young. A parent often took him to a piano storefront, and there, and on an old worn piano at home, the child studied his first exercises without a master. At the age of seven, he had a teacher, Michael Holzer, who shouted: ""When I want to teach him something, he already knows it."""
"There was a full moon at night when the team of soldiers marched from the city, it was still shining brilliantly through the mist, although it was five hours later. It lit a two-mile plain of expanse broken by ridges and ravines and covered with thick and tall grass and clusters of cactus and palmetto. In the hollow of the ridges, the mist was like wide lakes of water, and on one side of the plain stood the walls of the old city. On the other pink hills covered with royal palm trees that showed white to the moonlight, like hundreds of marble columns. A line of small campfires that the sentries had built during the night stretched between the forts at regular intervals and burned brilliantly."
"I heard the thunder of surfing against the cliffs, and the grey gulls gnashing as they threw and turned high into the sky. The tide crawled over the sands of the river, higher, and I saw the algae floating on the beach, and the shreds springing out of the moss, silver flashes in thread in the darkness. Curlew flew on the river in two and three; the timidity of the swallows flowed through the moors to a quiet and solitary pool, sheltered from the storm to come. In each hedge, the birds gathered, hiding together, grassed without rest. When I arrived at the cliffs, I rested my chin on my hands tight. Already a vast rain curtain, sweeping through the miles of the ocean, hid the island of Groix. To the east, behind the white semaphorus on the hills, the black clouds took hold on the horizon."
"The Shakespeare society of New York, which is really about the only useful literary organization in this country, makes vigorous efforts to repair an old evil and expier for a long neglect. Sunday, September 22, he held a meeting at the Poe cottage on the Kingsbridge road near Fordham, with the aim of starting an organized movement to buy the cottage, to restore it to its original state and to preserve it as a memorial of Poe. Thus came to the end. After helping to build monuments to Shelley, Keats and Carlyle we finally recalled this man, the greatest of our poets and the most unhappy. I am glad that this movement is in the hands of the American actors, because Poe found among them his best friends and admirers the warmest. In a way he always seemed to belong to the crowd Thespians who were his mother's people."
"There may be some wet grass, which would make it impossible to lay the precious wheel; or there may be a thousand other drawbacks. Some have come with the help of the bicyclist, and have invented a bike holder, which can be fixed to the machine, and raised at will, so as not to interfere with the wheel when in motion. This is just the thing that all the bicyclists wanted. Another busy brain has been at work in anticipation of the summer, and glorious time in store, riding along the country roads. An umbrella holder is the result. It consists of an attachment composed of portions that can be connected or removed at will. What a boon it will be, on a warm summer day, to have an umbrella comfortably held above the head, while the hands are free to guide the wheel!"
"On March 4, William McKinley was duly inaugurated as the leader of our country. For once the time was perfect, and everyone was in the best of mood, and from the beginning to see the views. At about ten o'clock, Major McKinley was escorted from his hotel to the White House by a company of soldiers. Here, he was received by Mr. Cleveland, who until the last moment was busy writing and handling the final functions of his office. Members of Mr. Cleveland's cabinet also came to pay tribute to the elected president. After the greetings, Mr. Cleveland and Major McKinley came out of the porch next door, ready to make their journey to the Capitol."
"Juno was about one more year old, I think, when there was a death in her family. One of the little kittens she loved with all her mother's heart died and left her desolation. It was a very sad occasion, I remember, but we had a big funeral. We dug the grave at the end of the garden. Johnny's express cart was the hearse, and Johnny drew it, and was very serious indeed. We borrowed Mrs. Martin's car, and he was the mourning coach. Juno rode in, with Ned and Gimps walking one on each side and holding it in. I pushed the coach, while a long procession of the neighbors' children came behind, crying with all their strength. We sang a hymn at the grave, and we did everything we could to calm Juno's grief. But Juno would not be reconciled."
"This game can be played by four, six, or eight players. Two players start for the first choice of partners; the winner also has the right for his side to be ""call"" or ""answer."" After the sides are chosen, the winner of the throw consults with his side, and they decide whether they will ""call"" or ""answer."" ""Call"" is considered the best position. The game is played with a map of the United States made of a perfectly simple dough with each state a separate coin, and without any names or marks on the tracks. This card should be large enough to have Rhode Island about an inch long, and the game should be played around a table with the sides named North, South, East, and West. The side that ""calls"" takes all states in a box."
"A Boston inventor has just perfected an excellent coat rack. At first glance, it looks like the ordinary hangers that we have been using for so many years, but this invention avoids the objection that attaches to all the other coat racks that we have met – it fits the size of the place in which it is to be used. Those who live in small houses or apartments with a lean closet know that the old coat rack is out of the question for them, two coats or size taking the length of the wardrobe. The new coat rack is adjustable. Its arms work on a spring. It can stretch them to the maximum where the space is not objected, but when used in a closet where each thumb counts, the accommodating arms fold together, and take a sleeve of the coat or waist on each arm, putting them together in the same position as they would be folded in a drawer."
"A little before three, the chief and all his house, with all the wandering guests who might have fallen, met in the room, which was in the center of his arches encircled, the main apartment of each old English house. Clouds of wood smoke, rolling with a fire that shone in the middle of the ground, blackened the chevrons carved from the arched roof before they found their exit from the hole above which they acted as a fireplace. Tapestries, dyed purple, or resplendent with panached images of saints and heroes, hung, and if the day was stormy, smashed on the walls in China. In the palaces and in the colored houses of tiles, forged in mosaic, formed a clean and beautiful pavement; but the common ground of the time was clayy, cooked dry with the heat of the winter and summer evenings at noon."
"The family had no idea how long they had spent with their ancestors before they were owners and lived on the farm. If they had ever thought about it, they probably thought they were still there. Really, it had to be very, very long — they were so well settled, so well informed about the earth and everything that was there; then they were so numerous and knew so much. It took a lot of time to learn everything about agriculture and dairy work, on construction, weaving and manufacturing, — to have discovered so much about the stars, the arrival and departure of the moon, the years and months that it did, — to have so many established customs, and a religion with prayers and cults, — and finally, to have invented writing and no useful end of art, demanding skill and long practice."
"One day, the children were out in the fields, running errands, picking flowers and making chains of marguerite! When they felt tired and hungry, they had milk and cake in the mother's basket, and they had a long rest on the dry and hot grass. ""How do these cups of butter shine!"" said Dora; ""They look like gold!"" ""cups of gold, they should be called, not cups of butter,"" said Harry. ""They look like cups, don't they?"" ""But they wouldn't hold the water like real cups. Look at this one; it's in five pieces."" ""Five? Oh yes! And look below. There's another kind of cup with five leaves in it."" ""Only it's not bright and golden, but green and hairy."" Now you discovered that outside, and I found the five yellow leaves."
"A small tree was in the woods. He had no leaves. He had needles. The little tree said, ""I don't like needles. All the other trees in the woods have pretty leaves. I want leaves, but I will have better leaves. I want gold leaves."" The night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came and gave him gold leaves. When the little tree woke up he had gold leaves. He said, ""Oh, I'm so pretty! No other tree has gold leaves."" The night came. A man came with a bag. He saw the gold leaves. He took them all and put them in his bag. The poor tree cried, ""I don't want any more gold leaves. I'm going to have glass leaves."" Then the little tree went to sleep. The fairy came and put the glass leaves on her. The little tree woke up and saw her glass leaves."
"A painful and dreadful spectacle has just risen before my eyes. I have torn the curtain that concealed the corruption of humanity. This word in my mouth is at least sure of the suspicion that it contains a moral charge against humanity. It is — I would like to stress it once again — free of moral acid: to such an extent, that is how I am perfectly aware of the corruption in question precisely in the neighbourhoods where until now people aspire with the greatest determination to ""virtue"" and ""god."" As you have already predicted, I understand corruption in the sense of decadence. What I maintain is that all the values upon which humanity builds its highest hopes and desires are decadent values. I call an animal, a species, a corrupt individual, when he loses his instinct, when he chooses and prefers what is harmful to him."
"At the first glance, I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable range of various objects was wrapped in the same grey cover. Then, I saw, standing strange and gauntleting in the centre of the room, which was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized by the oblique feet that it was a creature extinguished in the mode of the megatherium. The skull and the upper bones were next to the thick dust, and at a place where the rainwater had fallen through a leak into the roof, the thing itself had been used. Further in the gallery was the enormous barrel of skeleton of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed."
"Jupiter had two brothers, both terrible, but not nearly as great as himself. The name of one of them was Neptune, or Poseidon, and he was the king of the sea. He had a golden palace shining, far down in the deep seas where the fish live and the red coral grows; and whenever he was angry, the waves would rise up the mountain, and the storm winds would wail, and the sea would try to break the earth; and the men called him the Shaker of the earth. Jupiter's other brother was a pale sad being, whose kingdom was under the earth, where the sun never shone, and there was darkness and weeping and sadness all the time. His name was Pluto, or Aidoneus, and his land was called the lower world, or the land of Shadows, or Hades."
"But one day, when he had had the opportunity to look at the earth, he saw the flames, and the people who lived in the houses, and the flocks that were feeding on the hills, and the grain that was ripening in the fields, and it made him very angry. ""Who did all this?"" he asked. ""And someone answered, ""Prometheus! What!"" he cried, ""this young Titan!"" Well, I will punish him in a way that would make him wish to have locked him in prison with his parents. But as for these little men, let them keep their fire. I will make them ten times more unhappy than they had before them."" Of course, it would be quite easy to treat Prometheus at any time, and so Jupiter was not in great haste."
"Neddy was very ashamed, and told the man that his aunt would pay for all the broken things. Then he took his wicked animal, and began to go home and tie it up, for it was obvious that this monkey was not trustworthy. But as soon as they came out, Jocko went up a tree and threw himself on a hayload below. Here he danced and penetrated, and had a good time, throwing the man's coat and rake, and eating part of the dinner tied in a cloth. The bread crusts and the bones he threw on the horse; this new type of whip scared the horse, and he fled on a steep hill, and upset the hay and broke the cart. Oh, such a time! It was worse than the candy crust; for the man played, and the horse was wounded, and the people said that the monkey had to be slaughtered, he did so much harm."
"The rector had left for the day, being a man who did not like the view of the changes. He did not want to come back until the evening, when the new teacher would have arrived and settled down, and everything would be smooth again. The blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself stood in perplexed attitudes in the living room before the instrument. The master had noticed that even if he had it in the cart, he should not know what to do with it when he arrived at Christminster, the city that he was bound, since he was only going to temporary lodgings at the beginning. An eleven-year-old boy, who had been carefully helped in packing, had joined the group of men, and as they were rubbing his chin, he spoke, blushing at the sound of his own voice: ""Aurent had a great house of fuel, and he could be put there, perhaps, until you had found a place to settle down, sir."""
"One day he sat on the balcony after the evening tea, reading. At the same time, in the living room, Tanya taking the soprano, one of the young girls a contralto, and the young man with his violin, practiced a serenade well known to Braga. Kovrin listened to the words — they were Russian — and could not understand their meaning. Finally, leaving his book and listening attentively, he understood: a young girl, full of sick fantasies, heard one night in her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and so beautiful that she was obliged to recognize them as a holy harmony that is unintelligible to us, and flew to heaven. Kovrin's eyes began to close."
"And it is there! all eyes are turned towards the place where it lies, weakly discernable through the fog of assembly at the beginning of the winter afternoon; each finger is pointed in the same direction; and whispers of interest and admiration – like ""How beautiful!"" – are heard from all sides. Even the lazy man with his hat on one side and his hands in the pockets, who dispensed so much consolation by asking with a gag of another gentleman whether he is ""crossing"" – as if it were a ferry – even he condescends to look this way, and nods the head, as should say, ""No mistake about it:"" and even the wise Lord Burleigh in his wink, included half as much as this lazy man of force who made the passage (as everyone on board has already discovered; it is impossible to say how) thirteen times without a single accident! There is another passenger much wrapped, who has been beaten up with the rest, and has been crushed for a bit, and morally, and has been crushed by the rest."
"The man called Evans swirled along the canoe until he could look over his companion's shoulder. The paper had the appearance of a rough map. By folding a lot, he was bent and worn at the step of separation, and the second man held the discolored fragments where they had separated. On this one, one could darkly make, in an almost obliterated pencil, the contour of the bay. ""Here, says Evans, is the reef, and here is the distance."" He ran his thumb on the map. ""This curved and twisting line is the river — I could make with a drink now! — and this star is the place."" ""You see this line pointed, says the man with the map; it is a straight line, and short from the opening of the reef to a crowd of palm trees. The star comes just where she cuts the river. We have to mark the place as we go in the lagoon."" ""It's a strange pause,"" said Evans. ""It's a little pause."
"No one else but the Americans could rule America. The people were too intelligent, too active, too varied, too filled with indigenous quality and genius to be governed by the alien. If they fell under foreign submission, they would become a dead weight in the world, instead of a source of life; as Adams said, any increase in population would only be an increase of slaves. And that they preferred death to slavery every day became more and more evident. They felt that the future was within them, and that they had to have space and freedom to bring it out; and it is one of the paradoxes of history that England, to which they were bound by blood, from which they drew the instinct of freedom, should have tried to reduce them to the most absolute slavery known everywhere, except in the Spanish colonies."
"But why did she enjoy it, she could not explain herself satisfactorily when she tried to do so in part. She could not discover in him any of the bright and promising features that Gaston, her husband, had often assured him that he possessed. On the contrary, he was rather mute and receptive to his talkative desire to make him feel at home and to the frank and verbal hospitality of Gaston. His manner was as courteous to her as the most demanding woman could demand; but he made no direct appeal to his approval or even to his esteem. Once installed at the plantation, he seemed to like to sit on the wide porch in the shade of one of the great Corinthian pillars, smoking his lazy cigar and listening attentively to Gaston's experience as a sugar plant."
"There stood a comfortable and spacious armchair in front of the open window. There, she was flowing, pressed by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach her soul. She saw in the open square in front of her house the tops of trees that were all flowing with the new spring life. The delicious rain breath was in the air. In the street below a pedal boat wept for her goods. The notes of a distant song that someone sang reached her weakly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves. There were spots of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and stacked one over the other in the west facing her window."
"She had not spoken to her son Henri for ten years because he had married an American woman on Prytania Street. She did not want green tea to be introduced into her house, and those who could not or did not want to drink coffee could drink Laurier's flower tea for everything she loved. Nevertheless, the children seemed to have all their way that day, and the organ feeders were released. The old lady, in her retired corner, could hear the screams, the laugh and the music much more distinctly that she loved. She would stutter loudly, and humidify ""Party for Syria."" She was straight and thin. Her hair was white, and she wore them in puffs on temples. Her skin was fair and her eyes blue and cold."
"Now, what I observed during the time of my dwelling, I will speak to you. The first is that they are not begotten of women, but of humanity; for they have no marriage other than that of men; the names of women are completely unknown among them; until they fulfill the age of five to twenty years, they are given in marriage to others; since that time they take others in marriage to themselves; for as soon as the child is conceived, the leg begins to inflate, and after the moment of birth has come, they give him a spear and take her dead; then they put her abroad with an open mouth toward the wind, and so it takes life; and I think that the Greeks call her the belly of the leg, because they carry their children there instead of a belly. I will now tell you something stranger than that."
"Father Wolf waited until his little ones could run a little, and then the night of the pack meeting took them away and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Rock Council – a hilltop covered with stones and blocks where a hundred wolves could hide. Akela, the great Grey Loup Lone, who led the whole Pack by force and trick, stretched out along his rock, and beneath him sat forty wolves or more of each size and colour, badger veterans who could manipulate a dollar alone to the three-year-old black boys who thought they could. Loup Lone had driven them for a year now. He had fallen twice in a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten and left for death; so he knew the manners and customs of men. There was very little discussion at the Rock. The little ones were buzzing over each other in the middle of the circle where their mothers and fathers were sitting, and from time to time an elder wolf went quietly to a scumbag, looking at him without any noise and returning to his place."
"It was a burning day in August. Baker Street was like an oven, and the glare of sunlight on the yellow brick of the house across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to believe that it was the same walls that were mixing so darkly through the fogs of winter. Our blinds were half drawn, and Holmes was wrapped on the couch, reading and rereading a letter he had received by the morning post. For me, my mandate in India had taught me to stay warmer than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was not difficult. But the morning paper was not interesting."
"""I'm going to tell you what I know about Effie. She was a widow when I first met her, even if she was quite young — only twenty-five. Her name was then Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when she was young, and lived in the city of Atlanta, where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer with good practice. They had a child, but the yellow fever happened badly instead, and the husband and child died of it. I saw her death certificate. This sick woman from America, and she came back to live with a young aunt in Pinner, Middlesex. I can mention that her husband had left her comfortably, and she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that she had returned on average seven percent. She had only been six months in Pinner when I met her; we fell in love with each other, and we got married a few weeks later."
"""You couldn't have them for more than a few weeks. The soles you're presenting to me right now are lightly burned. For a while, I thought they could have been wet and burned in drying. But near the floor, there is a small circular sheet of paper with the shopkeeper's hieroglyphs. Damp would of course have removed this. You had then been sitting with your feet stretched out to the fire, that a man wouldn't even do in June so wet as if he were healthy."" Like all Holmes's reasonings the thing seemed simple itself when it was explained. He read the thought about my features, and his smile had a tint of bitterness. ""I fear I would rather give myself when I explain it,"" he said. ""The results without causes are much more impressive. You are ready to come to Birmingham, then?"" ""Certainly. What is the case?"""
"I looked at the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. It couldn't be a visitor at such a late hour. A patient, of course, and perhaps a night session. With a bloody face, I went out into the room and opened the door. To my astonishment, it was Sherlock Holmes who was standing on my feet.""Ah, Watson,"" he said, ""I was hoping that I wouldn't be too late to catch you."" ""My dear friend, please come in."" ""You look surprised, and no wonder! Also relieved, I want it! Hum! You're still smoking the Arcadia mix of your single days then! There's no mistake taking this mellow ash on your coat. It's easy to say that you've been used to wearing a uniform, Watson. You'll never pass like a pure-blood civilian as long as you keep this habit of wearing your handkerchief in your sleeve."
"His birthplace was in Cresswell, a small village near Morpeth, where he was born in August 1852, so that he was not quite thirty-nine when he finally used his incessant efforts. He also had a real education of Northern countries, among the moors and cliffs, and he drank in full this love of nature, and especially of the sea, which forms such a remarkable note in his later writings. Heather and the wave struck the keynotes. A son of the people, he first, in his childhood, went to the village school in Ellington; but on his eleventh birthday, he was removed from the wild north to a new world in Greenwich. There, he spent two years in the naval school; and immediately began his first experiences of life as a student at Ragged school in North Boucliers, not far from his original hamlet."
"He seemed to Babette to wait a long time, because the leaves on the trees were tender, and the figs were like small green marbles and hard. But the warm rains came and a lot of strong sun, and although Mother-Naiaine was as patient as the statue of the Madonna, and Babette as agitated as a hummingbird, the first thing they both knew was the warm summer. Every day Babette danced where the fig trees were on a long line against the fence. She walked slowly under them, looking carefully between the crumbled branches, spreading. But every time she came to disconsolve again. What she saw there at last was something that made her sing and dance all day. When Mamma-Nainine sat down in her majestic path for lunch, the next morning, her muselle cap standing like an aureola on her white and placid face, Babette approached."
"The little girl woke up in her arms and started screaming for ""Dada"". That was all she could do or say. Some people thought she had strayed there of her own free will, because she was of the sponge age. The dominant belief was that she had been deliberately left by a party of Texans, whose cart covered with canvas, late in the day, had crossed the ferry that Coton But kept, just below the plantation. In time Madame Valmonde abandoned all speculations, but that which Desiree had sent to her by a benevolent Providence to be the child of her affection, seeing that she was without a child of flesh."
"Jenny put the table for the tea party under a large oak. There was a flat place on one of the round roots that rose from the moss, which was the very thing for a table. Then she poured out the small white and golden plates and cups and saucers, with the meat dish (just as big as your hand), in the middle, full of candy. The milk, of course, was put in the pot for coffee, and put on three dead leaves to boil; and Jenny allowed Donee to fill the dishes with jam herself, with her own hands. Donée could hardly get her breath as she did. When they were all ready, they sat down. The sun was shining, and the wind was blowing, and the water of the mill race was flashing and grinning as she passed by, and a song-sparrow perched on the fence near them and sang, and sang, as if he knew what was going on."
"That evening, we almost had the visit of one of the animals we were looking for. Several times, we had heard the musical sound of the bull's momentum, a sound to which no writer has yet done justice. That particular night, when we were in bed and the fire was inflamed, we were attracted by a louder sound, a kind of groaning grudging or roaring, answered by the sniffs afraid of the ponies. It was a bear who, obviously, had not seen the fire, as it came from behind the bank, and who had probably been attracted by the smell of the horses. After he had done what we were, it remained little time, pronounced again his particular grunting, and left; we had seized our rifles and fled into the woods, but in the darkness could not see anything; indeed, he was rather lucky that we had not stumbled through the bear, as he could have done little work with us when we were at such a disadvantage."
"The parties in Switzerland are fortunately not divided by questions of race or religion, but the pastor possessed that Catholics were a difficult element, and had to be managed with care. They include the whole population of the Italian cantons, and a part of the French and Germans. In Geneva and other major cities, the question of work goes between with difficulty, and radicals, like our Democrats, are sometimes the retrograde party. The pastor spoke with a slight smile of the movements of Father Hyacinthe and Döllinger, and he confessed that Protestants have been cut too many sects to progress among the Catholic populations. Catholics often keep their children out of public schools, as they do with us, but they must undergo state examinations, to which all children, whether they are taught at home or in private schools, must submit. He deplored the lack of moral education in public schools, but he laughed at attempts in France to infuse non-religious moral principles: when I saw this later in the schools of Florentine I could not believe that I had reason."
"When she rose at eleven o'clock in the morning, Olga Ivanovna played the piano or, if she was sunny, painted something in the oils. Then, between twelve and one, she led to her seamstress. As Dymov and she had very little money, just enough, she and her seamstress were often put in intelligent posts to allow her to appear constantly in new dresses and make a sensation with them. Very often of an old dyed dress, pieces of tulle, lace, plush and silk, not costing anything, perfect wonders were created, something enchanting, not a dress, but a dream. From the seamstress Olga Ivanovna usually led to an actress of her knowledge to hear the last theatrical gosss, and moreover to try to get tickets for the first night of a new play or for a performance."
"One night — that was the twentieth of March 1888 — I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I was now returning to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-kept door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of study at Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he used his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly illuminated, and even looking up, I saw his great emergency figure passing twice in a dark silhouette against the blind."
"There is a quality that is never seen in Nature until it has been harassed by man and has not survived the use. It is the picturesque. In the depths of the primitive forest, along the mountain slope, and away from the stream, Nature can be majestic, beautiful and even sublime; but it is never picturesque. This quality comes only after the axe and saw left the sunlight in the dense corner and scattered the falling wood, or the round of the water wheel divided the stream rush. It is here. About a hundred years ago, along this calm and silver stream were camped the troops of the colonies in difficulty, and later, the great estates of the survivors stretched on either side for miles."
"Any individual memory of the trip to Holland, apart from what was told to me, enters into the travel car, a little bit of green leather Bajazzo dressed in red and white that a parent gave me, and the box of candy given to take the trip by a friend of my mother. From our reception in the Belgian capital at the house of Adolphe Jones, the husband of my aunt Henriette, a sister of my mother, I keep a lot of memories. Our pleasant host was a painter of animals, which I then saw share the workshop of his friend Verboeckhoven, and whose flocks of sheep were very praised. At that time, his workshop was in his own house, and it seems that I could still hear the call in the voice of my aunt shrill, repeated countless times a day, ""Adolphe!"" and the answer, quickly following in the deepest bass tones, ""Henriette!"" this singular monster, which has had a lot of fun, as I later learned, to the jealousy of my aunt, who could almost border on it."
"The miners insisted that, as these men were minors, they should have the full wages of the miners and the owners of the mines said they would not pay that amount. It seems that the Union of Minors is under the control of certain parties who run the organization in a way that is not in the real interest of the miners. The owners of the mines will never employ a man who is a member of the union. They say that if the men will withdraw from the union, they will employ them, but they absolutely refuse to be dictated by the union. Recently, seventy-eight scabs were shipped from Michigan. It was then feared that the problems would be encountered and perhaps scattered with blood, but the minors maintained their determination to comply with the law. About two hundred injunctions were served to various members of the Union of Minors to prevent them from interfering with the men who were about to start working on the mines."
"There is a moment in the life of every serious soul, where things, which were before invisible and unheard of in the world around him, become visible and audible. This amazing moment comes to some earlier, to others later, but to all, who are not completely delivered to the service of oneself, at a certain moment. From this moment on a change passes on such, for he hears more and more mysterious voices, and more clearly he sees forms of appearing floating from the depths over which he kneels. Where do they come from? What do they mean? He leans on the abyss, and behold! The sounds to which he hears are the voices of human weeping and the forms to which he looks are the apparitions of human misfortune; they ask him, and the voices beseech him in a multitudinous accent and broken heart: ""Come down, come down, oh, friend and brother, and help us."""
"The youth had now moved a lot beyond the furthest areas of the Abbey. He was all the more surprised that when he came to turn the way, he perceived a man dressed in the familiar clothes and sitting in a furnace of heather on the edge of the road. Alleyne knew all the brothers well, but it was a face that was new to him, a face that was very red and swollen, working so and so, as if the man were perplexed in his mind. Once he shook both hands furiously in the air, and twice he came out of his seat and rushed down the road. However, when he got up, Alleyne found that his dress was far too long and loose for him in all directions, dragging on the floor and crawling his ankles, so that even with twisted skirts, he could make little progress."
"From time to time, there are truths of greater nature than those of Franklin, and Sainte-Beuve, the great French critic, quotes, as an example of his occasional, finer moods, the saying: ""The truth and sincerity have a certain native lust that cannot be falsified; they are like a fire and a flame that cannot be painted.""But the wise man who invented the Franklin stove had no disdain for small utility; and in general the last word of his philosophy is expressed well in a passage of his autobiography: ""Human bliss is not so much produced by great pieces of good fortune, which rarely occur, as by few advantages that occur every day; therefore, if you teach a poor young man to shave and keep his shaver in order, you can contribute more to the happiness of his life than by giving him a thousand guineas."""
"What a vision we were: the chest of an athlete, the hands of a dandy, and the forehead of a child. We were a fancy dress ball, in English pants, a Parisian vest, a North American coat, and a hat of Spanish bulls. The Indian turned around us, mute, and went to the top of the mountain to baptize his children. The black, pursued from afar, alone and unknown, sang the music of his heart in the night, between waves and wild beasts. The campesinos, the men of the earth, the creators, rose up in blind indignation against the disdainful city, their own creation. We were carrying shoulders and court robes, in countries coming into the world with string sandals and Indian bandages. The natural people, driven by instinct, blind with triumph, submerged their golden leaders."
"During the winter of 1887-188, his friends first realized that a change had happened to him. They did not realize that his life was stopping; it was difficult to do so when there was so much of the old elasticity remaining; when he was still proclaiming himself ""very well"" as long as he did not suffer permanently. But he often suffered; a terrible cold followed the other. There was general evidence that he had finally aged. However, he made no distinct change in his way of life. Old habits, suspended by his longest prison sentences at home, resumed as soon as he was released. He was still having dinner; he was still seeing every one of them in private, or almost every art exhibition. He maintained his incessant correspondence--in one or two cases was voluntarily added to her; although he complained day after day that his fingers had suffered from the number of hours during which he had held his pen."
"As soon as she had left, Lady Windermere returned to the gallery of images, where a famous political economist solemnly explained the scientific theory of music to an indignant virtuoso from Hungary, and began to speak to the Duchess of Paisley. She was wonderfully beautiful with her large ivory gorge, her big blue eyes do not forget me, and her big reels of golden hair. Or they were — not this color of pale straw that usurps today the graceful name of gold, but such gold that is woven in the rays of the sun or hidden in the strange amber; and gave to her face something of the frame of a saint, with little fascination of a sinner. She was a curious psychological study."
"In the morning, with a beat of soft feet, the converts, the dubious and the scoundrels open, go up to the veranda. You must be infinitely kind and patient, and above all clairvoyant, for you deal with the simplicity of childhood, the experience of man and the subtlety of deceivers. Your congregation has a hundred subjects that want to be considered; and it is up to you, as you believe in your personal responsibility towards your Creator, to choose from the clamouring crowd any grain of spirituality that might rest there. If, in the healing of souls, you add that of the bodies, your task will be all the more difficult, for the sick and the mutilated will profess any belief because of healing, and you will laugh because you are simple enough to believe them."
"I am not afraid of anything,"" the man interrupted himself by another oath, and rushed to the ground. The two then joined the others at the door, which one of them had already opened with some difficulty, caused by the rust of the lock and hinge. All of them entered. Inside it was dark, but the man who had unlocked the door produced a candle and matches and made a light. He then unlocked a door to their right as they were standing in the passage. This gave them the entrance of a large square room that the candle but slightly illuminated. The floor had a thick carpet of dust, which partly stifled their feet. Cobwebs were in the corners of the walls and depended on the ceiling like rotting bands of lace making undulating movements in the disturbed air. The room had two windows in the adjacent sides, but nothing could be seen that the rough inner surfaces of the boards a few inches from the glass. There was nothing else but dust. There was nothing else; there was nothing else; there was nothing else; there was nothing else; there was nothing else; there was nothing to be done."
"It is only the writer who takes the material on which he writes directly from his own head that deserves to be read. Bookmakers, compilers and writers of ordinary history, and others like them, take their material directly out of the books; he passes through their fingers without paying the duty of transit or undergoing an inspection when he was in their heads, to say nothing about the elaboration. (How much would a man learn if he knew everything that was in his own books!) Hence their conversation is often of such a vague nature that one racks his brain in vain to understand what they really think. They do not think at all. The book they copy is sometimes composed in the same way: so that this writing is like a cast cast plaster, and so on, until finally all that remains is a barely recognizable outline of Antinus' face."
"We didn't have the means to work for our land; the few things they gave us did little good. Our rations began to be reduced; they said we were lazy. That's not true. How does a man of sense assume that so many people could get work at once, unless they once had the means to work and the instructors enough to teach them? Our ponies were taken away from us under the promise that they would be replaced by oxen and great horses; it was long before we saw them, and we had very few. We tried with the men we had, but under one pretext or another, we were moved from one place to another, or we learned that such a transfer was coming."
"At the top of the street, while the crew of the truck company worked with the heavy extension ladder which, at its longest stretch, was far too short, crept four men on long slender poles with transverse bars, in iron at the end. Standing in a window, they reached and pushed the hook through the next above, and then climbed a story higher. Still the glass crush, and still the staggering ascent. Straight up the wall, they crept, resembling human flies on the ceiling, and clinged as close, never resting, reaching a single reef to leave for the next; closer and closer to the race for life, until a single span separated the furthest from the boy. And now the iron hook fell at his feet, and the firefighter stood on the walk with the young boy rescued in his arms, just as the pent-up flames burst from the window of the attic, until only one of their furious ranges separated."
"The union of a royal title with priestly duties was common in ancient Italy and Greece. In Rome and in other cities of Lazio there was a priest called the Sacrylic King or King of Sacred Rites, and his wife bore the title of Queen of Sacred Rites. In Republican Athens, the second annual magistrate of the state was called the King, and his wife the Queen; the functions of both were religious. Many other Greek democracies had titular kings, whose functions, as far as they are known, seemed to have been priestly, and to have centered around the common heart of the state. Some Greek states had several of these titular kings, who were simultaneously occupying their functions. In Rome the tradition was that the Sacrylic King had been appointed after the abolition of the monarchy in order to offer the sacrifices that had previously been offered by kings. A similar point of view on the origin of the priestly kings seems to have prevailed in Greece."
"When he woke up, the room looked so funny. The sun was partly shining, and yet all the rest was rather dark and shaded. So Jack jumped and dressed up and went to the window. And what do you think he saw? Why, the beans his mother had thrown out the window into the garden had popped into a great bevetalk that climbed up and up until he reached the sky. Then the man told the truth after all. The bevetalk grew up pretty close to Jack's window, so all he had to do was open it and give a jump on the bevetalk that climbed like a large scale. So Jack climbed up, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed until he finally reached the sky."
"When they entered, they saw Dorian Gray. He was sitting at the piano, with his back to them, turning on the pages of a volume of Schumann's ""Forest Scenes."" ""You have to lend me these, Basil,"" he exclaimed. ""I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming."" ""It depends entirely on how you sit down today, Dorian."" ""Oh, I'm tired of sitting down, and I don't want a life-size portrait of myself,"" the young man replied, turning around the music stool in a voluntarist and petulant way. When he saw Lord Henry, a slight blush coloured his cheeks for a while, and he started. ""I ask you for forgiveness, Basil, but I didn't know you had anyone with you."" ""It's Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old friend of mine from Oxford. I just told him what you were a killer capital, and now you spoiled everything."""
"But the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten, for I heard the noises of the swing of the censors of the angels; and the waves of a holy perfume were always floating around the valley; and at lonely hours, when my heart was beating hard, the winds that bathed in my forehead came to me loaded with sweet sighs; and indistinct whispers often filled the air of night, and once, but only once! I was awakened from a sleep, as the sleep of death, by the impulse of the spiritual lips upon myself. But the emptiness in my heart refused even to be filled. I desired the love that had filled it before abounding. The valley grieved me for a long time through his memories of Eleonora, and I left it forever for the vanities and turbulent triumphs of the world."
"It was in 1613 that our philosopher published in Rome another book entitled ""L'Istoria e Dimostrazione Intorno alle Macchie Solari"". He was generally well received, although he drew a conclusion in favour of the rotation of the Earth on its axis. The controversy, however, became even more intense on the important point of the interpretation of Scripture. Now that we can look at the events of this day with all wise calm, we can well blame Galileo for having fallen into such a dangerous trap; but there was an excuse for him, attacked as he was on this same ground of the supposed incompatibility of his hypothesis with the teaching of Scripture; and therefore unfortunately he committed a serious error of judgment in facing a religious difficulty which, so wise, would have left entirely to the theologians. We can say that this is not what we should naturally expect."
"Harriet Beecher Stowe was born on June 14, 1811, in the characteristic city of New England, in Litchfield, Conn. His father was the Reverend Dr. Lyman Beecher, a distinguished divine Calvinist, his mother Roxanna Foote, his first wife. The newcomer was brought into a happy and healthy children's house, and found five brothers and sisters waiting for him. The eldest was Catherine, born on September 6, 1800. After she were two strong boys, William and Edward; then came Mary, then George, and finally Harriet. Another little Harriet was born three years before was dead when only one month, and the fourth daughter was named, in memory of that sister, Harriet Elizabeth Beecher. Only two years after Harriet was born, that same month, another brother, Henry Ward, was welcomed into the family circle, and after him came Charles, the last of Roxanna Beecher's children."
"Some men of letters, not necessarily the greatest, have an indescribable charm to which we give our heart. Thackeray is the first love of the young man. From living authors, no one perhaps enchants the reader more than Mr. Stevenson, who plays on words as if they were a musical instrument. Following the music is less difficult than placing the musician. A friend of mine, who, like Mr. Grant Allen, examines 365 books a year, and 366 in leap years, recently arranged the novelists of today in order of merit. Meredith, of course, he wrote first, and then there was a fall in Hardy. ""Haggard,"" he explained, ""I fell from the Eiffel Tower; but what can I do with Stevenson? I can't put it before ""Lorna Doone""."
"The hard necessity has prevented some great writers from doing their best work, but Stevenson is finally so firmly established that if he continues to be versatile he will only be of choice. He has achieved a popularity as it is, as a rule, granted only to classic authors or charlatans. For this, he has America to thank rather than Great Britain, for the Americans buying his books, the only honour of an admirer writer are slow to pay him. Stevenson's reputation in the United States is worthy of this country, which gave him a post in which only a few saw him when he left. Unfortunately, with popularity came advertising. All day the journalists sit on his garden wall. No man wrote in a more fine spirit of the profession of letters than Stevenson, but this gosssip vulgarizes him. The adulation of the American public and a small group of intelligent literary dandies in London, great in criticism, from whom he became the cherished, made Mr. Stevenson complacent, and he always loved too much."
"Lord Rosebery is forty-one years old and has missed many opportunities to become Lord Randolph Churchill's friend bosom. They were in Eton together and Oxford, and they have met since. Like a boy, the Liberal played horses, and the tory to run with other boys' caps. Lord Randolph was the most distinguished at the university. One day a proctor ran him into the streets smoking in his hat and dress. The first cycle noticed on the changeability of time, but the proctor, gasping at such a bravado, asked for his name and college. Lord Randolph failed to introduce himself the next day at St. Edmund Hall to be lectured, but he went to the proctor's house at dinner time."
"Now there was a man who was well in the world, and had three sons; the first was called Peter, and the second was called Paul. Peter and Paul thought he was as wise as anyone in the world, and their father thought as they did. As for the youngest son, his name was Boots. No one thought of him, except that he was stupid, for he did nothing but sit in the hot ashes all day long. One morning, Peter rose up and said that he was going to the city to try to inflict the king, for it would be a good thing to have a princess in the family. His father did not say no, for if anyone was wise enough to inflict the king, Peter was the boy. So, after Peter had eaten a good breakfast, he went to the city, with the highest right foot. After a while he came to the king's house and — rap! tap! — he knocked at the door. Well, what did he want? Oh!"
"Well, one day, a stranger came to this city from above the hills and far away. With him, he brought a painted painting, but everything was covered with a curtain so that no one could see what he was. He drew the curtain and showed the image to the young king and he was a resemblance of the most beautiful princess in the whole world; for his eyes were as black as a crow's wing, his cheeks were as red as apples, and his skin as white as snow. Moreover, the image was so natural that he seemed to have nothing to do but to open his lips and to speak. The young king sat down and looked. ""Oh me!"" he said, ""I will never rest until I have one like that for me."" ""So listen!"" said the stranger, it is a resemblance of the princess who lives beyond the three rivers."
"Jacob saw them come down on the road, and was ready for them this time too. He took two pots and filled them with pitch, and over the ground he stretched out gold and silver, so that if you had looked in the pots you would have thought that there was nothing in them but what you saw on the top. Then he took the pots in the small woods of the house. Now in the woods was a large deep pit, and all around the pit was pushing a row of bushes, so thick that nothing was seen from the mouth of the hole. By and by the coming of the priest and the mayor and the provost to the house of Mr. Jacob, blowing and blowing and smoking. Rap! Rap! Tap! They were knocking at the door, but no one was there, but Mr. Jacob's wife. Mr. Jacob was at home? That was what they wanted to know, for they had a score to settle with him."
"It is the wise part of the parents to repress these squibs and cracks of the juvenile quarrel, and to apply this slowly learned lesson, that in this world one often has to ""go"" and ""get with"" things in other people, being far from being perfect. As it is a kindness, and almost a duty, to let people think and say and do things in their own way occasionally. But even if Mr. and Mrs. Skratdj had never thought of teaching all this to their children, it must be admitted that the lesson would not have come with a good grace from one of them, because they were breaking apart and making mistakes as much or more than their children in the nursery."
"He was a very selfish giant. Poor children no longer had room to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they didn't like it. They wandered around the high wall when their lessons were over, and talked about the beautiful garden inside. ""How much we were there,"" they said. Then spring came, and all over the country there were few flowers and small birds. Only in the garden of the selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds didn't care to sing in as there were no children, and the trees forgot to bloom. Once a beautiful flower put his head out of the grass, but when he saw the notice board he was so sorry for the children that he slipped into the ground, and he went away to sleep."
"At the door of the castle, the prince waited to receive it. He had dreamy purple eyes, and his hair was like fine gold. When he saw it, he lay on a knee, and kissed his hand. ""Your image was beautiful,"" he murmured, ""but you are more beautiful than your image""; and the little princess was blushing. ""She was like a white rose before,"" said a young Page to her neighbour, ""but she is like a red rose now""; and the whole Court was delighted. During the next three days, everyone began to say, ""white pink, red pink, red pink, white pink""; and the king gave the order to double the wages of the Page. As he did not receive a salary for all this was of great use to him, but he was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Gazette of the Court. When the three days were over the wedding was celebrated."
"""Come here and listen to a story,"" said the aunt, when the single had looked at her twice and once in the communication cordon. The children were moving without a list towards the end of the aunt's car. Obviously, her reputation as a storyteller was not raised in their estimation. With a low and confidential voice, interrupted at frequent intervals by noisy and petulant interrogations of her listeners, she began an uncompromising and incredibly uninteresting story about a girl who was good, and made friends with each one because of her goodness, and was finally saved from a mad bull by a number of saviors who admired her moral character. ""Would they not have saved her if she had not been good?"" asked the greatest of the little girls."
"At first, Hidesato could not help feeling alarmed by the sight of this horrible reptile on his way, because he had to either turn back or walk on his body. He was a brave man, however, and putting aside all fear went forward unabated. Crunch, crunching! He was now walking on the dragon's body, now between his reels, and without even a look back, he was going on his way. He had only done a few steps when he heard someone call him from behind. In return, he was very surprised to see that the monster dragon had completely disappeared and in his place was a strange man who bowed most ceremoniously to the ground. His red hair floated on his shoulders and were surmounted by a crown shaped like a dragon's head, and his navy green dress was shaped with shells. Hidesato knew at once that it was not an ordinary mortal and he wondered a lot about the strange event."
"There was a bright day, but in the evening it was cold; and as she looked at the logs that shone on her home, she wanted the whole illuminated part of them to turn to gold. She was very accustomed — this little woman — to build castles in the air, especially when she had nothing else to do, or her husband was late to go home to her supper. Just as she thought it was late when there was a tap at the door, and an old man came in, saying, ""Mom, are you going to give a poor fire to your fire?"" ""And welcome,"" said the young woman, laying a chair on her. ""Then he sat down as close to the fire as he could, and stretched his hands towards the flames. He had a small handbag on his back, and the young woman did not doubt that he was an old soldier."
"During the winter of 1879, when I was in London, it was my fortune to attend a social meeting of literary men in the rooms of a prominent publisher. The rooms were full of tobacco smoke and speech, in the midst of whom were discernible, on all sides, the figures and faces of men more or less known in the world of books. The most remarkable among these characters was a broad, robust, medium-sized man, with a rough face, and snow white, the beard and tempestive hair. He wore large golden glasses, but his eyes were black and shiny, and looked at his interlocutor with a certain genius of inspection fury. He seemed to be in a state of excitement; he spoke at first volubly and almost sparingly, and his voice was full and powerful, although acceptable in the ear."
"Rosy went away, and she forgot all this. But she never forgot to be nice; and shortly after, as she looked in the grass of strawberries, she found a field mouse with a broken leg. ""Help me to my nest, or my babies will die of hunger,"" cried the poor thing. ""Yes, I want, and bring these berries so that you can stay until your leg is better, and have something to eat."" Rosy took the mouse carefully in her little hand, and bound the broken leg with a leaf of mint and a blade of grass. Then she carried it to the nest under the roots of an old tree, where four baby mice cried sadly for their mother."
"On the steps to receive them was an old woman, well dressed in black silk, with a white cap and an apron. It was Mrs. Umney, the maid, whom Mrs. Otis, at the sincere request of Lady Canterville, had agreed to keep in her old position. She each made a low curvature while they light up, and said in a picturesque and old way: ""I welcome you to Canterville Chase."" After her, they passed through the beautiful Tudor room in the library, a long low room, lacquered in black oak, at the end of which there was a large window window window. Here they found tea arranged for them, and, after having removed their envelopes, they sat down and began to look around, while Mrs. Umney was waiting for them."
"He remained at the station, sat at the kitchen, cut the firewood, cleared the courtyard and swept the platform. There was a fortnight, his wife came, and Semyon went to his cabin in his hand. The hut was new and warm, with as much wood as he wanted. There was a small vegetable garden, the inheritance of former hunters, and there was about half of a desiatine of ground ploughed on either side of the railway embankment. Semyon rejoiced. He began to think about farming, buying a cow and a horse. They gave him all the necessary shops — a green flag, a red flag, lanterns, a horn, a hammer, a scoop for nuts, a corb, a spade, a broom, bolts and nails; they gave him two books of regulations and a time table of the train."
"But only a small part of the whole reading that is done is oral reading. It is silent reading that is universally used as an instrument of study, business, fun. As a rule, very few arrangements are made for the acquisition of an ease in silent reading; this, we think, will translate as a by-product of regular training in oral reading. Almost the opposite is true. Ease and flexibility of articulation, speed in capturing the drift of ideas, and readiness to vary the tone of the voice in the expression of words in such an impressive way as to represent their latent feeling, - all this is possible with those alone, the forms of difficult words, the structures of complex phrases, and the infinite variety and play of thought and emotion, are more or less familiar through such a range of readings that only silent pursuit of it makes possible."
"Throughout the longest period of human history — it is called the prehistoric period — the value or non-value of an action has been deduced from its consequences; the action itself has not been taken into account, more than its origin; but almost as in China at the present time, where the distinction or shame of a child comes back to his parents, the retro-operational power of success or failure has been what has led men to think well or badly of an action. Let us call this period the pre-morial period of humanity; the imperative, ""Know you!"" was still unknown.—In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on some large portions of the earth, one has gradually arrived at that one no longer leaves the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide as to its value: a great achievement as a whole, an important refinement of the vision and criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy of the aristocratic values, which can be marked by the narrower period of knowledge of the origin, which ""may be the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning."
"Once there was a little girl, named Kitty, who never wanted to do what people asked her. She said ""I don't want to"" and ""I can't"", and didn't run at the same time pleasantly, as the compelling children do. One day her mother gave her a pair of new shoes; and after a restlessness about putting them on, Kitty said, as she was jerking off on the floor, ""I would like it to be seven-legged boots, like Jack the giant killer, so it would be easy to go shopping all the time. Now I hate to keep trotting, and I don't like the new shoes, and I won't move a step."" Just like she said, the shoes gave a jump, and put it on her feet so suddenly that she scared all the naughty out of her."
"One morning, Grandma had two loaves of rice, and some election cakes, rising, and intending to cook them in about an hour, when they should be light enough. What should Mrs. Dorcas do, but mix the sour milk bread and some pies with the highest speed, and fill the oven, before Grandma's kitchen was ready! Grandma sent Ann into the kitchen to put the breads in the oven and lo and behold! the oven was full. Ann stood fixed for a minute, with a cake of election in her hands; that and the bread would be ruined if they were not cooked immediately, as they were high enough. Mrs. Dorcas had taken Thirsey and gone out somewhere, and there was no one in the kitchen. Ann put the election cake on the table. Then, with the help of the claws, she arrived in the brick oven and pulled out all the pies and breads of Mrs. Dorcas."
"Mr. Matt Pike was single of about thirty summers, avant-garde clerk consecutive in each of the village's two stores, but recently a merchant on a limited scale in horses, wagons, cows, and similar objects of commerce, and at all times a politician. His hopes of occupying a post had been continually disappointed until Mr. John Sanks became sheriff, and rewarded with an important special service rendered by him at the very close end of his canvases. Now was a chance to increase, Mr. Pike thought. Everything he wanted, had often said, was a beginning. Politics, I would say, had been considered by Mr. Pike as a means rather than an end. It is doubtful that he hopes to become governor of the state, at least before an advanced period of his career. His main purpose was now to obtain money, and he believed that the official position would promote him in line with his ambition as quickly as possible to any private station, leading him to a more extensive knowledge of humanity, their needs, their desires and their desires."
"As soon as he returned home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking for the cause of this unfortunate breakup with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer, often very pathetically said, and sometimes darkly mysterious in the drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable.""I don't blame our old friend,"" writes Jekyll, ""but I share his point of view that we must never meet. I now want to lead a life of extreme isolation; you must not be surprised, and you must not doubt my friendship, if my door is often closed even for you."
"For a long time, there was nothing, beyond the voice of a weak bird that sang an old trite evening song that could probably have been heard on the hill at the same time, and with the same trillions, quavers and breves, at any sunset of this season for centuries. But as they approached the village with distant screams and rattles approaching some place raised in this direction, as still projected from the foliage. When the outlying houses of Weydon-Priors could be described, the family group was met by a navet-hoer with his hoe on his shoulder, and his dinner bag suspended from him. The reader looked up quickly. ""Any business doing here?"" he phlegmatically asked, designating the village in his van by a wave of the large leaf. And thinking that the worker did not understand it, he added, ""Everything in the line of hay-trushing?"" The navet-hoer had already begun to shake her head."
"It is, as a rule, after having lost a lot to the cards or after a drink when an attack of dyspepsia takes place in this Stepan Stepanitch Zhilin wakes up in a particularly dark state of mind. He looks sour, gnawing, and dishonored; there is an expression of displeasure on his gray face, as if he were offended or disgusted by something. He slowly dresses, sips his Vichy water deliberately, and starts walking in the rooms. ""I would like to know what b-b-b-b-best enters here and does not close the door!"" he grumbles angry, wrapping his dress on him and spit out loud. ""Take off this paper! Why is he lying here? We keep twenty servants, and the place is more distraught than a pothouse. Who was what sounded? Who is the devil?"" ""It was Anfissa, the midwife who asked you to go out, said his wife who brought our Fedya into the world."""
"I was in my room, with a slight illness, for two or three weeks, and I received them one morning. I could not have had nicer or more entertaining visitors, and I am sorry when, after two or three days, I had to say goodbye to them. They are very ""natural"" people, just Western. I am grateful to you for making me known with them. ""Just Western"" is the acme of praise. I think I once told you what a pleasure it gave me as a compliment. Several years ago, at the end of one of our Christmas receptions, a young Western man, taking my hand and asking me Good night, said with great cordiality, ""Mr. Norton, I had a pleasant time; it was just Western""; ""The Kentons"" is really, my dear Howells, an admirable study of life, and as it was read to me my great pleasure in listening was in your understanding, your creative imagination, your humor, and all your other written gifts, which have always been faithful."
"The cannons and the superior officers of the church had fled on the first day of Griffin's visit, leaving behind them the Canon Minor and some of the men who opened the doors and swept the church. All the citizens who could afford to close their houses and go to distant places, and only the workers and the poor were left behind. After a few days, these people ventured to go and look after their affairs, for if they did not work, they would die of hunger. They had become a little accustomed to seeing the Griffin; and having been informed that he was not eating between equinoxes, they were not so afraid of him as before. Day after day, the Griffin became more and more attached to the Canon Minor. He kept close to him a great part of the time, and often spent the night in front of the little house where the young pastor lived alone."
"But something happened that made every mouth mute and every eye fixed. In the meantime, of course, the rope dancer had started his performance: he had come out at a small door, and he was walking along the rope that was stretched between two towers, so that she hung over the market and the people's square. When he was just halfway, the little door opened once again, and a man dressed like a buffalo was going out, and quickly went after the first. ""Go, stop-foot,"" shouted his scary voice, ""Go, lazy bone, interlope, suif-face!"" —for fear that I would tickle you with my heel! What are you doing here between the towers? In the tower is the place for you, you should be locked; better than you block the way!""""And at every word he approached and closer to the first."
"He was a strange figure who clasped along the road that applauded the morning of May. He was tall and spoiled, and had been for thirty years or more. The long head, bald on the top, covered behind with iron grey hair, and in front of a short, tangled growth that shrouded and combed in all directions, was surmounted by a hat with an old skillet rod, worn and dyed, but eminently impressive. An old coat of Henry Clay fabric, dyed and threaded, divided impartially on the donkey's back and dilated on his sides. That was all that remained of the elder's wedding dress forty years ago. Only constant care, and the use of the last few years limited to additional occasions, had kept it so long. The pants had soon left the company with his friends."
"Simon approached the stranger, looked at him, and saw that he was young, in shape, without bruising on his body, he barely began to freeze and to be afraid, and stopped there without looking Simon, as if he were too weak to lift his eyes. Simon approached him, and the man seemed to wake up. Turning his head, he opened his eyes and looked into Simon's face. This look was enough to make Simon love the man. He threw the felt boots on the floor, untie his belt, put him on the boots, and took off his coat of cloth. ""It is not a moment to speak,"" he said. ""Come on, put this coat at once!"" Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to get up. As he stood there, Simon saw that his body was clean and in good condition, his hands and his feet shaped, and his good and good face. He threw his coat on the shoulders of the man, but he did not hide the man's arm. Simon could not find the man's arms."
"This chain or belt is equipped with boxes which, as they overlap, form an endless pan. The power being applied to turn one of the wheels, the entire belt is then moved and immediately becomes an endless conveyor. The engraving accompanying it illustrates a section of this conveyor. Some of the pans are removed, to show the construction of the links; and above, a link and a coupler are shown on a larger scale. As will be seen, the link is provided with wings, to form a rigid support for the stove to be riveted to it. To reduce the friction each link is supplied with three rolls, as will be seen in the engraving. This holding makes a fire-resistant carrier that will handle the hot ore of the oven to be grilled, and will carry coal, broken stone or other coarse materials."
"An article recently appeared in several documents, claiming that New York is a highly magnetized city - that the raised railway, the Brooklyn Bridge cables, etc., are all very magnetized. As this could convey to the general reader the impression that the magnetism thus exposed was particular to the city of New York, and as many of your subscribers look with anxiety for your answers to many questions posed for the elucidation of apparent scientific mysteries, I thought that perhaps a statement in a clear language of experiences made at different times, to elucidate this subject, could, in conjunction with a diagram, serve to explain even those who have not made a special study of science some of the interesting phenomena related to terrestrial magnetism."
"The annular space between the two receptacles is filled with water at the same level as the solution in the receiver, and the latter is provided with suitable pipes or coils, in which the vapour is required to circulate to raise the solution of the desired temperature, and to perform the digestion process. At the same time, any vapour produced accumulates in the upper part of the boiler, and maintains an equal pressure throughout the apparatus. The arrangement is clearly indicated. In the boiler is placed the receiver, pottery, lead, or other materials, leaving an annular space between it and the boiler; this space is filled with water. The receiver is equipped with a series of pipes, in which steam or hot water circulates, to heat the load at the desired temperature. These pipes can be arranged either in coils or vertically, and they are provided with inner return pipes, so that any condensed water accumulating at the bottom can be forced by the vapour pressure and escape to the top."
"One image shows the portable rest made by the Gardner Gun Company. It consists of two forged iron tubes, each with a right angle of each other; the front bar can be easily unlocked and placed in line with the trail bar, from which project two arms, each provided with a screw that serves to adjust the cannon side. These screws are arranged in such a way as to allow an oscillating movement of the cannon through any distance up to 15 degrees. The tripod mount, used for naval and land purposes, illustrates the two complete cannons. The five cannon is mounted on a similar tripod. The length of this weapon on all is 53.5 inches, the barrels (Henry's system) are 33 inches long, with seven grooves of a uniform twist of a tower in 22 inches."
"Some improvements have recently been made by Mr. Alexander Glegg and the inventor in the famous Jamieson grapeau, used to lift submerged submarine cables. The main feature of the grapnel is that the slides, being joined to the catch, fold against a spring when they catch a rock, until the grapnel eliminates the obstruction, but allow the cable to come home to the crutch between the fluke and the base. In the older form, the cable was likely to be stuck, and cut between the fixed toe or fluke and the longer fluke joined to it. This is now avoided by kissing the short fluke in the longest. The chamfer, once screwed in the boss, is now pushed through and held against the collar of the boss, by the volute spring, which at the same time presses the articulated slides after being moved by a rock. The chamfer can now turn freely around, while before it was rigidly fixed."
"There are cases where a long screw has to be turned with a cross nut or another threaded part running on its thread from a limited and variable distance. At some point, the threaded nut or part may be forced to go almost the entire length of the screw, and at another time a much shorter crossing would be necessary. In many cases, the use of side control nuts is awkward, and in some cases it is impossible. One way to use the nut as a set collar is to drill through its side for a set screw, to place it on its screw, to pour a little melted Babbitt metal, or to place a short cold socket into the hole, to type the hole, and the tap will force the Babbitt into the wires. Insert the set screw, and when it acts on the Babbitt metal, it will force it with great friction on the wire without injuring the wire; and when the screw tension is set, the nut will rotate freely."
"The ordinary casts taken in plaster vary somewhat, due to the shrinking of the plaster; but it has not so far been possible to adjust this to produce any desired change and yet retain the proportions. Hoeger, de Gmuend, has, however, recently designed an ingenious method to make copies in any material, reduced or enlarged, without distortion. The original is first surrounded by a box or frame of sheet metal or other suitable material, and a negative casting is taken with an elastic material, if there are subcuts; the inventor uses agar-agar. The usual negative or mould having been obtained as usual, he prepares a mass of gelatin resembling the hektograph mass, first soaking gelatin, then melt it and add enough of any substance inorganic powder to give it some stability."
"In an arc lighting system, however, we have to deal with completely different conditions; because, while in the incandescent system, the addition of a lamp, which reduces the resistance, does not require an increase in the electromotive force, the opposite is the case in the light arc system. Here, each additional lamp added to the circuit means an increase in the resistance, and therefore an increase in the force or electromotive potential. By taking for example a well-known system of arc lighting, we find that the lamps individually require an electromotive force of 40 volts with a current of 10 amperes. In other words, the difference in potential at the two terminals of each lamp is 40 volts. Therefore, if the circuit was touched in two places, including one lamp, no harmful effect would ensue. If we touch the circuit to include two lamps between us, the effect would be greater, since the potential between these two points is 2 x 40 volts."
"A mature oyster with eggs lays about 1 million eggs, so that during the breeding season there are at least 2 200 000 000 000 young oysters on our oyster beds, which would surely be sufficient to transform the entire extent of the marine platforms into a bed of unbroken oysters; for if such a number of young oysters were to be distributed over an area of 74 km long by 22 widths, 1,351 oysters would be allocated to each square metre, but this sum of 2,200 000 000 000 young oysters is probably less than that actually hatched, because not only oysters over six years of age are spawning, but they are beginning to spread in their second or third year, although it is true that young people have fewer eggs than those fully developed."
"From September 26, 1882, to September 1, 1883, night and day without interruption, a watch was kept, in which the officers participated, so that the observations could be regularly made and recorded. Every four hours, a series of direct magnetic and meteorological observations were made, from one hour to the next, of recorded meteorological notes, the rise and fall of the sea, often multiplied by observations every quarter of an hour; longitude and latitude were determined exactly; a number of additions were made to the catalogue of fixed stars for the southern skies; and numerous specimens of natural history were collected. The apparatus used by the expedition for the recording of the magnetic elements was designed by Mr. Mascart, by which the variations of the three elements are inscribed on a sheet of paper covered with gelatin bromide, inclination, vertical and horizontal components, with a certainty that emerges from the 330 diurnal curves reported from Cape."
"The primary purpose of a launch, in the modern sense of the term, is to transport passengers on rivers and lakes, less than for the transport of heavy goods; therefore, it cannot be out of place to consider the conveniences arising from the use of a motor power which promises to become useful as time and experience goes on. In a recent paper before the British Association in Southport, I mentioned many experiments made with electric launches; now it is proposed to deal with this topic in a broader sense, affecting the points of convenience in the first place; second, on the cost and method of generating electricity current; and third, on the construction and efficiency of propellant power and its accessories."
"Wastes to be treated, observed Captain Galton, whether in towns or barracks or in the camp, fall under the following five heads: 1, ash; 2, kitchen waste; 3, stable manure; 4, solid or liquid ejections; and 5, rainwater and domestic wastewater, including water from personal ablutions, kitchen washing, passage washes, stable stables, and pavements. In a camp, you have the simplest form of dealing with these issues. Water supply is limited. Waste water and liquid ejection are absorbed by the ground; but a camp without latrines would still be in a state of danger of epidemic disease. One of the most common causes of an unhealthy air condition in a camp has been either neglecting to provide latrines, so that the ground outside the camp becomes covered with dirt, or building latrines too shallow, and exposing too large a surface to rain, sun, and air."
"Mr. T.R. Cramton, who at the Southampton meeting of the British Association suggested a tunneling method which, under certain conditions, seems to be an excellent promise, proposed to Southport to build three-lane tunnels. Now, the undeniable objective of all engineers is the economy of construction and the securing of permanent benefits. Mr. Crampton argues that the suggested system will give these tunnels, for example, three 17 feet in diameter, can be constructed less expensive than one 30 feet in diameter. After describing Sir J. C. Hawkshaw's project for ventilation of long tunnels, the three-lane plan was discussed."
"The most suitable soil for the complete development of I. glandulosa is a strong, clayy, retentive loam; it does not thrive well in the light shallow soils in the London district, except in shady positions. I. Hookeri is a perennial with free flowers, pointed lanceolate leaves, of a delicate texture, bright green, and very finely toothed. The flowers, which are gently fragrant, are not so large as those of I. glandulosa, and are produced individually, the flowers of ray being, however, much more numerous, few, rarely fewer than thirty. It is found in abundance in rocky places at Sikkim, where it replaces the almost allied I. grandiflora, a dwarf species, with much shorter and brighter leaves; both are very desirable plants either for rock or flower edge work. Elecampane (I. Helenium) is an imposing, robust species, with large broad or longer leaves."
"There are no windows in our houses, for the light comes to us also in our houses and out of them, day and night, even at all times and in any place, from which we do not know it. It was in the past, with our scientists, an interesting and often studied question, ""What is the origin of the light?"" and the solution of it has been tried several times, without any result other than to trample our lunatic asylums with potential solvers. Therefore, after unsuccessful attempts to indirectly suppress these investigations by making them liable to a heavy tax, the Legislature, in relatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them. I—alas, alone in Flatland—now knew too well the real solution of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge cannot be made intelligible to only one of my compatriots; and I am the only possessor of the truths of space and the theory of the introduction of these houses, more painful as the light of the world."
"In the meantime, the pioneer of Eskdale did not forget his mother. For years, he had constantly written to him, with his hand printed, so that the letters would be read more easily by his old eyes; he had sent him money in full proportion of his means; and he had taken every possible precautions to make her as comfortable as her changed circumstances could easily return them. And now, in the midst of this great and responsible work, he found time to ""go down"" to Eskdale (very different from what we can do ourselves by the London and North Western Railway), to see her elderly mother again before her death. What a meeting that should have been, between the poor old widow of the shepherd of Eskdale, and her prosperous son, the surveyor of Shropshire County, and the engineer of the great and important Ellesmere Canal!"
"You boast, moreover, when you commit yourself to being angry with everyone and against everything. You cannot. You are weak before grief, as all loving people. The strong are those who do not like. You will never be strong, and that is so much better. You must not live alone anymore; when the strength returns, you must really live and not close it for yourself. I hope you will be reborn with spring. Today, we have the rain that relaxes, tomorrow we will have the sun of animation. We only overcome the diseases, our children have had very bad colds, Mauritius very upset by the box with a cold, I resume with the chills and anemia: I am very patient and I prevent others as much as I can be impatient, there is everything in it; impatience with evil always doubles the evil. When will we be wise as the elders have understood it?"
"The first glimpse of Mount St. Michel is strange and strange to the extreme. A vast ghost object of a very pale pink tint suddenly rises from the bay, and the first impression is that we have read the ""Arab Nights"", and that this is one of those fairy palaces that will fly away, or will gradually fade away, or will sink body through the water. Its solemn isolation, its non-terrestrial color, and its flamboyant outline fill the spirit of astonishment. Mount St. Michel is by far the most perfect example of a medieval fortified abbey in existence, with its city and its surrounding outbuildings, simply, as if time had remained with them since the 15th century. The great granite rock rises to the height of two hundred and thirty feet of the bay; it is twice an island and twice a peninsula over the course of twenty-four hours. The only approach is at low water, driving or walking on the sands."
"The first well was deposited about eight years ago, but more has been accomplished over the last two years than all the previous time. A well we visited has produced 130,000 barrels over the last three years, and is still producing. There have been no very large wells, the best being 250 per day, and the average being about 90 barrels, but they maintain their production, with little decrease year after year. Drilling has been found difficult, as much of the rock is broken slashed obliquely. The tools slide on one side very easily, and a number of ""twisted holes"" have been successful. A driller has lost his tools in a well, and finished it with new ones. The cost of burying a well is $5,000 to $7,000, depending on depth, etc. Most of the wells are 1,200 to 1,500 feet, but some have given a much smaller depth. A 270-foot well produces 40 barrels per day for about three years, and has been further deepened."
"These enemies of our agriculture were hardly considered harmful not many years ago, for the reason that their sources of development were lacking. Lucerne and clover are relatively recent introductions in France, at least as forage plants. Other crops are often very tested by the dodder, and what is particular is that there are almost always species that are peculiar to a particular plant, so that the botanist usually knows in advance to determine the parasite whose presence is made to him. Thus, the cuscuta de lin, called by the French bull of the Lin, and by the English, the dodder of flax, grows only on this textile plant, whose cultivation it often destroys. Because of this, the botanists call this species Cuscuta epilinum. Others, like C. Europaea, attack preferably hemp and neltle. Finally, some species are unfortunately indifferent and take possession of a plant that will feed them."
"The first French exploration, which was an experimental voyage, was carried out in 1880 by the Worker in the Gulf of Gascony. His unexpected for the results was so important that the following year the government decided to continue his research, and the Worker was again made available to Mr. Alph. Milne Edwards and to the commission he chaired. Mr. Edwards crossed the Gulf of Gascony, visited the coast of Portugal, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and explored much of the Mediterranean. In 1882 the same ship undertook a third mission in the Atlantic Ocean, and to the Canary Islands. The Worker, however, being a side-wheeled consulting boat designed to do the service at the Port of Rochefort, did not have any of the qualities necessary to carry out necessarily long-term voyages."
"We measure weights or forces by comparison with certain weights, lengths, surfaces and standard volumes generally known and accepted, by comparison with a unit length, resistance by a standard ohm, etc. In the same way, currents can be measured by comparison with a standard current: but this would be an embarrassing process, not only because of the necessary apparatus, but also because it would be difficult to have a standard current always ready for use. In general, measurement by direct comparison with a standard unit is ruled out for the more indirect method of measurement not the current itself, but its chemical, mechanical, or magnetic effect. The chemical method is very precise if an appropriate current density across the electrode surface is used, but since it requires considerable time, and especially an absolutely constant current, its use is almost entirely limited to laboratory work and calibration of other instruments."
"The province of Minas Geraes covers a large part of the Brazilian empire, with areas of about 900,000 square kilometres, representing almost one third of the total surface area. The population is relatively small and is spread in a very broken country, where there are very few means of communication. It is therefore necessary to succeed in producing what is required by simple means and which require rapidly erected works of such materials which can be within reach. Iron ore is in great abundance in this region and is very easily exploited. In the centre of a mass of quartzites which seem to constitute the upper level of the eruptive lands of the province, there are layers of iron ore designated as itabite - a mixture of iron oxide and quartz. These strata are of great thickness and have many outcrops that allow their work per quarry. These itabites are in two very distinct aspects and offer some difference in their composition."
"The establishment of advanced special education courses in the main branches of mechanical engineering may, if properly ""doubled"" in the organization, be a way of relieving some of the pressure which must be felt in the attempt to run a course as described below. Higher education departments or other special departments, in which, for example, railway engineering, marine engineering and cotton, wool or silk engineering, must be taught, can be organized so that some of the lectures in the general course can be transferred to them, and instructors in the latter course thus recorded, while the subjects taught, treated by specialists, can be developed more efficiently and economically."
"Leclerc du Sablon has published some of his results in his work on fruit opening. The influences that act on fruit are external and internal. The external cause of dehiscence is drying. We can open or close a fruit by drying it or wetting it. The internal causes are related to the arrangement of the tissues, and we can say that the opening of the fruit can easily be explained by the contraction of the woody fibers under the influence of drying. Leclerc shows from experience that fibers contract more transversely than longitudinally, and that the thicker fibers contract the most. This is related to the opening of the dried fruit."
"The air in an oven or enclosed space heated by flames inside is similar to the very overheated steam. It contains a large proportion of humidity, and yet has the power to dry any substance that is heated to close to its own temperature. A mass of cold metal placed in the oven is instantly redesigned with humidity, which dries as the metal temperature rises. This is, for many purposes, an objection, and the remedy is to close the bottom of the oven and place the burners under. If for drying purposes and air current is necessary, the easiest way is to place in the bottom of the oven a certain number of tubes suspended downwards in a position such that the heat of the flame acts both on the bottom of the oven and on the sides of the tubes, which, of course, must be long enough for the lower opening to be well below the level of the flame. The outlet may be at any level, but for drying purposes it is better at the top, and it should be controlled by a damper to prevent cooling by excessive air currents."
"In some of the frames used at the School of Mines for the manufacture of large blue prints, a similar device has been used for several years. However, from the heavy and cubic back used by Mr. Parsons, a light, rather flexible back of a quarter of an inch of pine is used, covered with a heavy cantonal flannel and several thicknesses of newspaper. The pressure is applied by strips of ash slightly thicker in the middle than at the ends, giving a fairly uniform pressure across the width of the frame sufficient to hold firmly against the glass at all points. This system has been used successfully for frames twenty-seven by forty-two inches, about half the greater than that described by Mr. Parsons. A frame of this size can be easily handled without mechanical aids. Care must be taken to avoid too large a thickness and too large a spring in the pressure bands, or the plate glass can be broken by excessive pressure."
"The author asks first of all - what is the cause of the different specific gravitys of one and the same metal depending on whether it was cast, rolled, wired, or hammered? Does the observed difference prove a true condensation of the material under the action of pressure, or is it simply due to the pressure expulsion of gases which were occluded when the ingot was cast? According to well-known research, metals such as platinum, gold, silver and copper, which have been proven occlus gas on fusion, and to allow them to escape, incompletely, on solidification, are precisely the ones which are most increased in their specific gravity by pressure. The author has subjected to pressures of about 20,000 metals atmospheres which possess this property, either not at all, or to a very small extent, and he finds that if a first pressure produces a slight permanent increase in density, its repetition makes little difference. Their density is found to have reached a maximum."
"A first class boat will be about the following dimensions: Length on all, 45' to 50'; width (extreme), 9' to 10' 3'; depth (inside), 3' 10"" to 4'. The keel is oak 6"" by 31⁄2"". The stem and stern poles are also oak. The plantation is usually oak or walnut — the latter preferred — and is 3"" thick, the width of the boards being 41⁄2"". Many boats are now constructed of hard wood up to the water line and the Norwegian pine above. The fasteners are galvanized nails 41⁄2"" long. The mast-partner and all the counterweights are oak 11⁄2"" thick and 8"" wide; the latter are fixed with iron knees. The leeboard and rudder are oak, walnut or chestnut; the rudder extends from 31⁄2' to 4' under the keel, and, by giving a resistance to the side, the little eye is the more directed sideward, the vessel that the sideward is balanced the sideward, the vessel which is the most directed sideward."
"The steam is supplied by two circular return boilers, 9 feet 6 inches in diameter and 10 feet in length, with two furnaces in each. The boilers, which are made of steel as a whole, with the exception of the tubes, are placed longitudinally, and are equipped with two pairs of patented Martyn-Roberts safety valves. They have a steam dome between them. The total heating surface is 1,700 square feet, the total steam space is 330 cubic feet, and the operating pressure of 100 lb. per square inch. The fire pump is a Wilson ""Excelsior"" with a 10-inch steam cylinder and an 8-inch water barrel. This powerful pump is in a special compartment of the front hold, and will draw water from the hold, sea, or either hold."
"It was a direct action tricycle shown by the National Cycle Company of Coventry, in which the foot pressure was carried directly on the main axle, and thus passed without loss to the drive wheels on each side, the rider's position being arranged in such a way that sufficient load was allowed to fall on the rear wheel to obtain the certainty of the steering. The weight of this machine is much lower than when using the gear, and friction is also considerably reduced, tests with the dynamometer having shown that on a smooth and level road, a traction of 1 lb. easily moved, while with a rider on the seat of 4 lb. was sufficient. On this tricycle, it is said, any ordinary hill can be mounted with great ease, and as proof of its power, it was exposed to the Stanley show climbing on an 8-inch piece of wood, without any impulse."
"The lethargy in the malting trade, and in all the materials related to malting processes, induced by two centuries of restrictive legislation, is gradually shaken by the malting industry under the new law. For many years, almost all the improvements in malting processes have come from abroad, because the laws of Parliament have hindered all the processes and the use of all the required instruments in a malting industry in this country. The complete elimination of these legislative restrictions gives the possibility to improve the processes, which promises to open a considerable field for engineering work, and to develop a very backward art through the application of scientific principles."
"About fifty miles from the mouth of the Atbara and, of course, on the eastern bank of the Nile, stand the pyramids of Meroe. They consist of three groups, and there are in all about eighty pyramids. The presumption is that they represent the ancient tombs of the kings of Meroe. Candance, Queen of the Ethiopians, mentioned in Acts, chap. viii., v. 27, is supposed to belong to Meroe, which is also the name of the capital, which is heard for having been somewhere near the tombs. These pyramids of Meroe possess a marked characteristic, distinguishing them from the pyramids of Egypt itself, that is, they have an outer door or a porch. Since there is no entrance to the pyramid to these portals, it is quite possible that they are temples for worship or make offerings to the dead."
"We frequently have questions about the best ways to remove a negative gelatino-bromide from its glass bracket so that it can be used either as a direct or reverse negative, and it does not seem to be well known that about two years ago Mr. Plener described a method that responds well in all circumstances, whether a substrate was used or not. If a negative is immersed in the highly diluted hydrofluoric acid contained in a plate of ebonite, say a half teaspoon at half a pint of water, the film soon becomes loosened, and floats glass, this circumstance being due to the action of the solvent that the acid exerts on the surface of the plate as soon as it penetrates the film. If the floating film is now taken on a plate that has been lightly waxed, and it is allowed to dry on that plate, it will become quite flat and free of wrinkles. To wax the plate, it should be kept before the fire, until it is moderately hot, after which it is rubbed with a piece of wax, and a piece of straw is polished."
"The total length of this railway, which extended from the Eiskeller in the Schwimmschul-Allee to the north entrance of the Rotunda, was 1528.3 metres; the gauge was 1 metre, and 60 percent of the length was tangents, the remaining 40 percent being mainly curves of 250 metres radius. The gradients, three in number, were very small, on average around 1:750. Two generator dynamos were used, which were coupled in parallel circuit, but in such a way that the difference in potential in both machines remained the same at all times. This was accomplished by the well-known coupling method introduced by Siemens and Halske, in which the current of one machine excites the field of the other. Although the railway was not built with the objective of achieving high efficiency, an electromotive force of only 150 volts was used, however a mechanical efficiency of 50 percent was obtained, both with one generator and one car with two passengers, and with three passengers, as well as with three generators."
"The height of the first floor is eleven feet, the second ten feet, and the cellar is six feet six inches in the light. The porch is built so that it can be placed on the front or on the side of the house, as it may suit the owner. The rooms, eight in number, are airy and of practical size. The kitchen has a litter, sink, and boiler, and a large closet, to be used as pantry. The windows leading to the porch go to the ground, with heads running in the walls. In the attic the rooms are 10x10 feet, 13x14 feet, 12x13 feet, 10x101⁄2 feet, and a hall 6 feet wide, with large closets and closets for each room. The building is built so that an addition can be made at any time by using the current kitchen as a dining room and by building a new kitchen."
"Recent experiments have been conducted by Mr. Sanson to address the issue of whether or not oats have the exciting property attributed to them. The nerve and muscle excitability of horses has been carefully observed using electrical appliances graduated before and after they have eaten a certain amount of oats, or received a certain principle that Mr. Sanson has managed to isolate oats. The main results of the investigation are: The oat fruit pericarp contains a substance soluble in alcohol and capable of exciting nerve motor cells. This substance is not (as some have thought) vanillin or the smelling principle of vanilla, nor at all like it."
"It was founded a century ago by Ruiz and Pavon on a species of Mexico, M. uniflora., which, as far as I know, is almost so little unknown to current growers. When Lindley wrote his ""Genera and Species"" in 1836, three species of Masdevallias were known only to botanists, but twenty-five years later, when he prepared his ""Folio Orchidaceae"", nearly forty species were known in herbaria, and perhaps today a hundred kinds are cultivated in our gardens, while travelers tell us of all the magnificent beauties that are known to exist high on the cloudy slopes of the Andes and Cordillera of the New World."
"This ceremony at the Pantheon was concluded by all the visitors writing their names on two albums that had been placed near the tomb of Victor Emmanuel and the tomb of Raphael. The commemoration in the Hall of Horatii and Curiatii in the Capitol was a great success, their Majesties, the ministers, the members of the diplomatic corps, and a distinguished assembly being present. Signor Quirino Leoni read an admirable speech about Raphael and his epoch. The former town of Urbino, the birthplace of Raphael, fell into disuse, but remembered its historical fame on this occasion. Representatives of the government and municipal authorities, and delegates of the major Italian cities went to procession to visit the house where Raphael was born. The commemorative speeches were delivered in the large hall of the Ducal Palace by Signor Minghetti and Senator Massarani. The commemoration ended with a cantata composed of Signor Rossi. The Via Raffaelle was illuminated in the evening, and a performance of the gala was given at the Theatre of Sanzio."
"It is well known that the water of the various lakes and rivers differs in color. The Mediterranean Sea is indigo blue, the sky of the blue ocean, Lake Geneva is azure, while Lake Four Forest Cantons and Lake Constance, in Switzerland, as well as the Rhine, are chromium green, and Lake Kloenthaler is grassy green. Tyndall thought that the blue colour of the water had a cause similar to that of the air, being blue by the reflected light and red by the light transmitted. W. Spring recently communicated to the Belgian Academy the results of his research on the colour of the water. He proved that the perfectly pure water in a 10 metre long tube had a distinct blue colour, while, according to Tyndall, it had to look red. Spring also showed that the water in which lime, silica, clay and salts carbonate were suspended in a beautiful state of division offered resistance to the passage of light that was not unsound."
"The force with which compressed gas and oil rush upwards almost surpasses the belief. Drilling, jars and bars are sometimes shot down with debris, oil and whistling gas. Sometimes, this gas and oil catch fire, and last summer, one of the wells ignites so violently that a number of days have passed before the flames are extinguished. More often, the tank provided is insufficient, and thousands of barrels escape. Two or three years ago, at the peak of oil production in the Bradford area, 8,000 barrels per day ran into waste."
"The villa which we give a drawing in perspective is designed as a country residence, being designed in a quiet and picturesque style of gothic domestic, often encountered in old country houses. It is proposed to face the exterior walls with red bricks Suffolk and Corsham Down from the stone dressings, the chimneys to be finished with moulded bricks. The gables, etc., would be half wooded in oak, and the roof covered with red tiles Fareham laid on felt. Internally, the hall and corridors must be laid with tiles; the wood finish on the ground floor to be drowned, and on the first floor of pitch pine. The ground floor contains a drawing room, 23 ft. by 16 ft., with an octagonal recreation corner (which also forms a feature in the elevation), and the door leading to the veranda. The morning room, 16 ft. by 16 ft., also leads to the veranda. Dining room, 20 ft. by 16 ft., with the door leading from the kitchen."
"On the morning of 20 March, a long series of earthquakes spread in all the cities and in many villages scattered on the sides of Mount Etna. Shocks followed at intervals of a few minutes; there were hearths of dull underground roarings, and an imminent catastrophe. In the evening, the ground split at the lower part of the mountain, at the edge of the cultivated area, and four kilometres north of the village of Nicolosi. There formed on the earth a great number of very large cracks, through which escaped large volumes of steam and gas which enveloped the mountain in a thick mist; and towards night, a very bright red light, which, seen from Catania, appeared to come out in great waves from the foot of the mountain, announced the coming of the lava."
"The path of the earth through space is spiraling, so that it is all the time advancing in new regions with the sun. It is on a journey without bounds of discovery, and its human crew are born and die in widely separated expanses of space. Think of the distance on which the journeys of the sun have carried the earth only since the beginning of human history! Six thousand years ago the earth and the sun were about a million kilometers away from the stars in Hercules that they are today. Columbus and his contemporaries lived when the earth was in a region of the universe more than sixty billion kilometers from the place where it is now, so that since its time the whole human race has made a journey into space, in comparison with which its longest journey has been like the step of a fly. Thus, the great events in the history of the world can be said to have taken place in different parts of the universe."
"I have lived almost sixty years in the woods, and I have never seen, and never heard any other person talk, about the flowering, sowing, and maturation of the water maple. I have a beautiful maple bass along the street in front of my house. In March 1882 I observed that they were in bloom, and many bees were crawling around them. After the bees that left them, I noticed the seed (specimens locked from the growth of this spring) in millions. As the leaves were coming out in April, the small seeds of the knife blade fell, so thick that they almost covered the ground. My grandson picks up three or four full hats, and I sent them to my farm and drilled them like wheat, when I planted corn."
"The artists from all over the country told me that after a few tests, they prefer it to anything else, while excellent and effective enlargements of the plain are easily made by it if only carefully manipulated. A very good enlargement is made by the vitrification of the image, as I have just done, with the opal, then press it on a clean glass, and then the framing with another glass in front, when it will look almost equal to the opal. To make sure of the image adhering to the glass, however, and at the same time to give more shine, it is better to pour the glass with a solution of 10 or 15 grains of clear gelatin before pressing it."
"We have here ropes, a bridge, a sound board, or the belly, as it is technically called, indispensable for the production of the tone, and indivisible in the general effect. The proportionate weight of the rope must be reached by a proportional thickness and barring from the board to the sound, and a proportional thickness and the elevation of the bridge. The tension of the ropes is satisfied by a framing, which has become more rigid than the power of drawing of the ropes has been gradually increased. In the present concert greats of Mr Broadwood, this drawing power can be declared as starting from 150 lb. for each rope in the treble, and gradually increasing to about 300 lb. for each rope in the bass. I reserve for the historical description of my subject some opinions of the different types of framing that have been introduced. It will suffice, at this stage, to say that it was at the beginning of the wood, and became, by degrees, of wood and iron; in this day the iron very predominant."
"The raw gum cut into irregular strips passed five or six times between two 16-inch-diameter high rollers, and made two or three turns per minute. These rollers are held wet by the spinning water on them. This wide strip of gum is perforated with foreign substances and looks like a sieve. It is then put in the cutting machine, a horizontal drum equipped with an axle with knives on it. Such heat is produced by this cup that the water would soon boil if it were not renewed. A second machine of this type completes the cut and subdivides, and expels the air and water from it. The mass is then pressed into round or quadrangular blocks. The vulcanization of thin articles from a twenty-fifth to a sixteenth inch thick, is made by the patented process of Parkes, that is, the soaking in carbon disulfide during a short laps, to which chloride or sulphur bromide was added, and when the solvent evaporated the sulfur, which remains behind."
"The paper has the following advantages: First. The sensitive coating is regular, and its thickness is uniform on the entire surface of each sheet. Second. It can be exposed for a luminous impression in any kind of slide as usually built. Third. It can be developed and fixed as easily as a negative on glass. Fourth. The negative obtained dry rather flat on blotting paper. Fifth. The film that constitutes the negative can be detached or peeled from its support or support easily and easily by the hand, without the help of any dissolution agent or other agent. Thus, this invention moves away from all sensitive preparations on glass, which is both a fragile and relatively heavy material, thus reducing the weight and weight of the luggage of amateur and scientific photographers during travels; it produces photographic negatives as fine and as transparent as those on glass, to the extent that the film contains no grain; and, finally, it admits that the impression of either side of the film, as regards the production of positives on paper or other materials, as well as of the negatives, of which the negatives, and the negatives, of which must be removed."
"In the construction of a dam such as this one, the difficulties to challenge were unusually great. It was necessary to make it as tight as possible and to be always submerged. Allow for the water used by the canal and the slip and the leak there should be a depth on the ridge of the dam in low water of 2.50 feet and in height of about 10 feet. These depths turned out to be in the end correct. The river reached its highest in mid-May, and its lowest in September. It usually begins to rise again in November. Nothing could be done except during the short low season of the water, and a few years nothing at all. Even at the most favorable moment, the amount of water to be controlled was large."
"In composite lenses, matter is complicated by the relative focal points of its constituents and their distance away; but these elements, in an ordinary photographic objective, would affect so slightly the result that for all practical purposes they can be ignored. What we propose to do - what we have actually done - is to make two of these constant terms within the framework of a diagram, here given, so that a simple inspection can indicate, with his help, the center of the lens. All that is necessary to make use of it is to plant the camera perfectly straight, and to place in front of it, exactly fifteen feet from the center of the lens, a rule of two feet, also perfectly straight and with its center the same height of the floor as the lens, and then, having precisely developed with as much great diaphragm as the sharpness will give, to note the size of the image and to return it to the diagram."
"The current is carried under the holes by means of an insulated copper cable carried in wrought iron pipes, placed at a depth of 18 inches. At the crossing points, which are located on slopes, the driver takes the inside, and the car rises the hill also runs inside, while the car descending the hill moves by gravity on the outer lines. From the brush the current is brought to a switch worked by a lever, which switches the frame of resistance placed under the car, inside or outside, as may be desired. The same lever modifies the position of the brushes on the switch of the dynamo machine, reversing the direction of rotation, in the manner indicated by the electric holding. The current is not, so to speak, suddenly lit, but passes through the resistors, which are then cut in part or in whole, depending on whether the driver wishes to run at partial speed or at full speed."
"My method of analysis of olive oil is as follows: first, the so-called elaidine test is done, then the test with nitric acid. About 5 c. c. (a teaspoon) of the oil is mixed in a test tube with its own volume of nitric acid, spec. gr. 1.30, and agitated violently for one minute. At the expiration of this period, the oils will have acquired the following colors: olive oil, pale green; cotton seed oil, yellowish brown; sesame, white; sun flower, dirty white; peanut, rape, and castor oil, pale pink or pink. As soon as the colour was observed, the test glass is put in a water bath at the full boiling temperature and left there five minutes. It was found that the action of nitric acid on cotton seeds and sesame oil was the most violent, sometimes so violent, as to throw oil from glass."
"The French brass mouldings and the brass metal works are made of light and cheap brass, and have a fine gold colour that is not produced by the gold varnish, but by a copper coating. This gives them a finer appearance, so that they sell better. This golden color can be easily produced at very little cost and with little problems by the following process. Fifty grams of caustic soda and 40 grams of milk sugar are dissolved in a liter of water and boiled for a quarter of an hour. The solution is clear as water at the beginning, but acquires a dark yellow color. The container is then taken from the fire, placed on a wooden support, and 40 grams of a cold concentrated solution of a turbid blue vitriol. A red precipitate of copper suboxide is both formed, and at the time the mixture cools at 167° Fhr., the precipitate will be installed."
"She was indisputably apprehensive of him, and she ruled her house with such an intelligent economy that she seemed to live in luxury. She gave the most delicate attention to her husband, accompanied him and caressed him; and so great was his charm that six years after their marriage, Mr. Lantin discovered that he loved his wife even more than during the first days of their honeymoon. He found only two of his tastes: his love for theatre and his taste for imitation jewellery. His friends (the wives of a few small officials) frequently bought him a box in the theatre, often for the first performances of the new plays; and his husband was obliged to accompany him, whether he desired it or not, to these entertainments which bothered him excessively after his work in the office. After a certain time, Mr. Lantin begged his wife to ask a lady for her knowledge to accompany her and bring her home after the theatre."
"The hydrochloric acid gas passes into a container of an appropriate material with a false perforated bottom. Under this false bottom, a pipe connects to a second similar container connecting to a vacuum pump with a stop pipe. As soon as the maximum vacuum is reached, the gas is started through a three-way tail at a pressure of 40 mm. Mercury. The gas fills the first container and saturates the fabric. The released heat (about 500 calories per kilo, gas) is absorbed by the combined water in the wool, because, because of the low pressure, a quantity of steam is formed sufficient to take heat. This vapour flows through the second container at a temperature of 35° Cent., penetrates the material and evacuates through the pump. After saturating the contents of the first container, the gas passes into the second. AS as soon as it is a quarter or a third saturated, the first container is removed and replaced by a third party, who receives the surplus of No. 2 in the same way, and so on."
"I found that when I used charcoal or bone charcoal instead of charcoal, it was even more effective; but it should be mentioned that when used, they should be purified as follows before using: The blood charcoal contains potash and therefore it is necessary to wash it with distilled water and dry it before using it. The bone charcoal (also called bone black, animal charcoal, etc.) contains on average 10 percent nitrogenated and hydrogenated carbon, 8 percent lime carbonate, 78 percent lime phosphate, in addition to magnesia phosphate, lime sulphate, soluble salts, etc. Before using it, it should be treated with diluted hydrochloric acid until it becomes more thick. The bone charcoal is then left to rest for 24 or 30 hours and at the end of this time is washed with distilled water until the waste paper is washed."
"""At first, lizard was freely manipulated by Regent Park officials, and being a lizard, was considered harmless. It was certainly dull and inactive, a result probably due to his long journey and lack of food. However, thanks to the examination of Dr. Gunther, the British Museum, and the actual experience, we now know that the Heloderma will need in the future to be classified among the mortal enemies of other animals. Examining his mouth, Dr. Gunther discovered that his teeth formed a literal series of poison ferns. Each tooth, apparently, has a poisonous gland; and the lizards, it can be added, are abundantly fed with these organs as a rule. Experimenting on the virulence of the poison, the Heloderma was made to bite a frog and a guinea pig."
"Throughout the third great geological time, the Mesozoic, these rivers became more important, and the lowest portions of the Missouri began to form a tributary of a certain size. Ohio had not yet united with the Mississippi, and these two rivers were emptied into an arm of the Gulf of Mexico, which then reached a short distance above what is now their junction. In time, Ohio is probably older than Mississippi, but the latter river grew and eventually absorbed Ohio as a tributary. In the first part of the fourth great geological time - the Cenozoic - almost the entire continent was above water."
"The forms of hats that are the least harmful are: for winter, soft hats of light weight, having an open structure, or pierced with many holes; for summer, light straws, also of open structure. As regards the covering of the women's heads, the modes were for several years favorable to the correct shape. The hood and hat have become quite small, and cover but little of the head. This beneficial condition, however, is partly counterbalanced by the weight of the false loops, switches, buffalos, etc., with the help of which the women dress the head. These, by interfering with the evaporation of secretions, prevent an appropriate regulation of the scalp temperature, and also lead to the retention of a certain amount of excrementary materials, which are both prolific sources of rapid thinning and hair loss in women."
"A few years ago, it was decided to wash the walls and ceiling of a small cellar to make it lighter. That's why an appropriate quantity of lime was splashed. A worker who was to wear a common salt vase for another purpose stumbled on the lime drum and poured part of his salt into it. To hide all traces of his bad conduct, he agitated in the salt as quickly as possible. The circumstance came to my knowledge after, and this involuntary addition of salt to lime excited my keenest curiosity, because lime was not only irreproachable, but hard as cement, and would not wash. After this experience, I used a mixture of lime milk and salt (about three parts of stone lime to one part of salt), for a short or a light well."
"The Kimberley mine was the deepest and most regular. The deepest was De Beer, which was however very unevenly worked. Then followed that of Du Toit Pan and Bultfontein. The Du Toit Pan mine then ranked as important for the Kimberley mine. Diamonds were first discovered in 1867 by Mr. O'Reilley, a merchant and hunter, who visited a colonist named van Niekirk, residing in Griqua. The first diamond, after having been sent to the authorities, was estimated at 500 l. Great excitement was caused throughout the colony, and the American natives began to search for diamonds, and many were found, among which one of the eighty-three carats and a half, worth 15,000 l. In 1868, many enterprising settlers made their way up the Vaal River, and found a good number of diamonds."
"I cannot write you on any other subject at this time. There is not a thirty-hour railway trip in the world so full of great and beautiful views. I should perhaps qualify this statement by deducing the hours of darkness; but it is really a happy improvement in the enjoyment of the traveller; it seems providential that there is a part of the road just long enough and without interest to allow someone to go to sleep without being afraid to miss anything sublime. Exit Salt Lake City at noon, we accelerated through the fertile and populous valley of the Jordan, through the lake of fresh and charming Utah, and to the valley of the Spanish Fork. All the way the superb granite walls and the peaks of the Wahsatch accompanied us to the east, while to the west, through the great valley, were the blue contours of the Oquirrh range."
"The very high proportion of water contained in the sample is very remarkable. It has been so loosely combined, that even at ordinary temperature it has gradually escaped, the coal falling into small pieces. The large quantity as well as the high percentage of oxygen characterize the so-called coal as a lignite, with which conclusion the physical characteristics of the sample are in perfect harmony. The resin to which I referred has not been analysed further. It has been insoluble in all ordinary menstruals, such as alcohol, ether, carbon disulfide, benzene or chloroform, nor attacked by the boiling alcoholic potash or by the fusion of alkali."
"When tinned iron is used to contain food material, it is essential that the tin used is free of lead. The latter metal is rapidly oxidized on the surface and dissolves in this form in neutral acids of vegetables, meat, etc. The most accurate method to demonstrate the presence of lead is to treat alloy, called tin, with aqua regina containing relatively little nitric acid. The whole dissolves; excess acid is caused by evaporation at boiling heat, and the residue, diluted with water, is saturated with hydrogen sulfide. Iron remains in solution, while mixed lead and precipitated tin sulphides are allowed to digest for a long time in alkaline sulphide. Tin sulphide dissolves only; it is filtered and converted into stannic acid, while lead sulphide is transformed into sulphate and weighed as such."
"The crust of the clay earth is covered with a reddish brown cover of about half a millimetre thick. This cover proves to be composed, under microscope, of cell filaments and various bodies in the form of various compositions. They are composed of cells with densely and coarsely granulated reddish-coloured contents - the shape, size and composition are very variable. The cellular bodies constitute the essential organic part of the clay substance, and, without a doubt, if something of the organic compounds of the substance is genetically related to the disease, these bodies would have this role. The structure and coloration of the cell content show the closest alliance with the characteristics of the Chroolepideæ division and of this small division of Chlorophyllaceous Algæ, the closest to Gongrosira---a genus of which five to six species are inhabitants of fresh water, most attached to various aquatic minutes Algæ and mosses. Each cell of all plants of this kind produces a large number of mobile cells-----zoospores."
"And this birch sap contains sugar, the peasants of many countries, especially Russia, well aware of the art of making birch wine by fermenting its saccharin juice. But I do not find an hourly or daily record of the amount of sugar sap that can be extracted from birch, or from any tree, before it has acquired its great apparatus of digestion or rather of development and perspiration - its foliar system. And I do not know any extensive chemical analysis of sap, birch, or any other tree. Besides the sugar, which is present in this sap up to 616 grains - near an ounce and half a tonne, there is a simple trace of mucilage; no starch; no tannin; 31⁄2 grains per gallon of ammonia salts producing 10 percent nitrogen; 3 grains of albuminoid material producing 10 percent nitrogen; a separate trace of nitrites; 7.4 grains of nitrates containing 17 percent nitrogen; no salts; no salts of potassium; no salts; no salts of sodium; or meres;"
"The inhabitants - five men, one woman and two children, according to the census of the eclipse - are natives of Tahiti. The houses are structures of a history with sides of boards, probably cut out in California and brought in ships, to be erected on this island. The island on which they are built is about three-quarters of a thousand in diameter and almost circular in outline. The edge, rising five to twenty inches of the water, according to the phase of the tide, descends under the water at the same coral table running many feet in the sea; and is impossible to walk on it with bare feet. At the end of this table, the reef descends perpendicularly, an abrupt precipice, into the unfathomable sea. No ship can anchor here, and make a landing was an exciting matter. The island was approached in small boats on the side sheltered from the wind, and here, with the chance that characterized the voyage, was found the only opening in this coral barrier."
"The mounds of the earth here were known to cover an ancient city, for some sphinxes and statues had already been found; but what city it could be, the archaeologists were at a loss to be determined; although some, with Professor Lepsius at their head, believed that there was nothing other than the Rameses or the ""Raamses"", which the children of Israel built for Pharaoh, and from where they began on their last Exodus. However, any identification, of the location of the biblical cities in Egypt was so far from speculating. Practically nothing precise was known as the geography of the Israelite sojourn, except that the country of Goshen was doubtless in the eastern part of the Delta, and that Zoan was Tanis, whose immense mounds must form the subject following the operations of society."
"Nothing in the nature could surpass the affection that the kangaroo female manifests for her young girl. There is something quite touching in the anxious concern manifested by the dam while the young are at stake. On the least alarmed the young person is instantly bogged down in the pocket of his sweet mother, and if he, in the exuberance of his joy, took out his head from his place of refuge, he is immediately pushed back by his dam. I have, on several occasions, by the hard trick, pressed a string at the terrible end, and it is only when hope had completely abandoned him, or when his capture was inevitable, that she rejected the fawn. Their method of war often reminded me of the style of two pugilists practiced, the objective of each being firmly grasped his opponent by the shoulder, to accomplish what, the long back leg, with its heat-throwing blade of his ore, comes into play formidable."
"The next important but often overlooked precaution is to have a good wet course on all walls, internal as well as external. I know that to save a few books (most often they can be fractured in sensible and visionary features) it often happens, that even if a wet course is provided in the exterior walls, it is dispensed with with in the interior walls. This can only be done with impunity on a really dry ground, but in too many humid cases finds its way up, and, at least, disfigures the walls. Here, I would stop to ask: What is the main reason for building houses? I would reply that, in this country at least, it is to protect us from the wind and time. After going at great expense and having difficulty excluding cold and damp by walls and roofs, should we not take as much trouble to prevent them from using them from below and attack us in a more insidious way? Various materials can be used as wet courses."
"In Austria there is a large mining and manufacturing industry, that of the ozokerite, or of the earth wax, which has nothing similar in any other part of the world known, an industry that provides part of its beeswax to Europe, without the help of bees. It is perhaps not generally known that oil extraction was a profitable industry in Austria long before it was in that country. In 1852, a drug addict near Tarnow distilled the oil and made an exhibition of it at the first World Fair in London. In America, the first troubles were made in 1859. Indeed, the use of oil as an illuminator was common at a very young age in the history of the world. In Persia in Baku, India on Irawada, also in Crimea, and on the Kuban River in Russia, oil has been used in lamps for thousands of years."
"I prefer nitric acid for this purpose. I also found that some samples of bromide were being carried out in a very special way. Everything was going well until washing, when the silver bromide washed slowly, making the washing water slightly milky; it continued until all the silver bromide was discharged from gelatin, and the latter made it perfectly transparent as in the first case. I remember a gentleman mentioning at one of the meetings of the South London Photographic Society that he was troubled the same way I was at that time. I think if some experiments were made in this direction with zinc salt and worked, it would be a great advantage."
"It is indicated in Gewerbeblatte Hessen's fur that the paint can be renewed and refreshed as follows: When cracks and controls appear in the paint on wooden objects, this usually indicates that the varnish has cracked. If this is the case, the article can easily be prepared for a fresh layer by spongeding it with strong ammonia water, and two or three minutes later by scraping the varnish with the broad end of a spatula before the ammonia has dried. This way, the first layer is removed. If it is necessary to remove the following coating, the same operation is repeated. After the last layer has been scratched that needs to be removed, it must be washed with enough water to make the ammonia inactive, then the surface is rubbed with sprayed powder to make it smooth."
"Mr Perkin, an English chemist, and Mr Graebe and Mr Liebermann, German chemists, almost simultaneously applied for patents in 1869 in England, and since their methods were almost identical, they arranged the priorities through the exchange of licences. The German license became the property of the Badische Aniline Company, and the English license became the property of the predecessors of the North British Alizarine Company. These patents expire in about two months, and the speaker explained that an attempt by the German manufacturers to monopolize this industry further (even after the expiry of the patent) proved abortive. He also stated that the alizarine, 20 percent of the production, is now sold at 2s 6d. by lb., but that if the price has been reduced by half, there will still be a good profit for the manufacturers, and that the United Kingdom is the largest consumer, absorbing one third of the total production, and that England has advantages over all other countries for the manufacture of alizarine, the fifth, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, the first, and, the second, the first, the first, the first, the first, the second, the, the second, the second, the, the second, the second, the, the, the, the second, the, the second, the, the second, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the second, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the"
"St. Blaise, the property of Sir Frederick Johnstone, was raised by Lord Alington, and is by Hermit of Fusee. It is an indisputable pedigree, because Hermit is now such a successful and fashionable sire as Stockwell was even in his most palmy days, while Fusee was much more than a medium interpreter on the territory, and won several Queen's Plates and other races on a distance of ground. St. Blaise is in no case a big foal, standing considerably under sixteen hands. His color is about his worst point, as it is a light, chestnut, with a bald face and three white heels. He has a good head and neck, and very powerful back and muscular quarters, added to which his legs and feet are well shaped and perfectly sounded. His first appearance was made in the twenty-fourth Biennale Stockbridge at the Bibury Club meeting, when he won quite easily; but there were only four moderate animals behind him."
"In recent decades, the Bahama Islands sponge industry has grown at such a pace that it is the second largest on the island. Although the product is not of as excellent quality as that of the Mediterranean, it sells well and is in demand both in England and in America. For the sponge fishing of small vessels of ten tons of cargo are used and inhabited by six to twelve men. Sponges that are washed on rocks and reefs are caught with iron rakes attached to long poles, or are brought to the surface by divers and distributed on the deck of the boat. This kills their soft and viscous organisms, which are black as tar. Sponges are then beaten several times with sticks to remove this black viscose, and then washed well. Sponges are then sorted and softened for several hours in lime water, sun-dried and bleached."
"If the fertilized fish egg is placed in a solution of wine vinegar at 50 percent [any ordinary vinegar will probably answer as well] the embryo, even during the very first stages of development, will become apparent to the eye lying on the transparent egg. The acetic acid contained in the mixture, a water part to a part of wine vinegar, causes the embryo material to coagulate, while the egg remains clear. A short period of time after the egg is laid in this mixture, and in the first week after the impregnation, a white circle at a pole of the egg should become apparent, and during the second week a white cylindrical streak running from the edge of the circle towards its centre should be evident. If these characteristics are not developed by the test, the eggs have not been fertilized, and are therefore worthless."
"In September 1881, a national competition was opened by the central executive committee for the monument, and by the unanimous voice of the committee the premium plans of the architect, Don Cayetano Buigas Monraba, were adopted. Of these plans, which we find in La Ilustracion Española, we give an engraving. Richness, greatness and expression, usefully combined, are the characteristics of these plans. The landing structure is divided into three parts, a central and two sides, each extending forward, after the manner of a water cup, in the form of the arch of a 15th century ship, bearing in mind the two caravels, the Pinta and Niña; two large lights occupy the points of advance on each side; a rich balustrade and four statues of famous persons complete the magnificent facade. A noble monument, surmounted by a statue of the discoverer, is seen on the esplanade."
"It is an improved form of another stretching machine which had been produced in considerable numbers by Mr. Archibald Edmeston, an engineer from Salford, who manufactures a specialty of calico printing and finishing machines. The improvements consist mainly of a simplification of the work pieces and a deep construction of the machine. The adopted principle is well known. The selvages of the fabric, or more strictly the two edges of the fabric, of a width of about two inches, are caused by the passage and at the same time are held by the rims of two diving pulleys. The rims are farther away where the fabric leaves them than where they grasp it, hence the stretching is gradually, certainly, and uniformly performed. The fabric is seized by the pressure of an endless belt acting against the lower half of each pulley, the edges being held between them. In the engraving these stretching pulleys are indicated by the letters AA; the endless leather ribbon passes on the pulleys, CC, each pulley of which is equipped with a pulley."
"The mill shown in the perspective view is one of the twenty-six 41⁄2 foot saws long, 38 inches wide saddle in the light, and 20 inches running, capable of making 230 strokes per minute. The crankshaft is nine inches in diameter, of the best forged iron. The main pillow block has a base 61⁄2 feet long by 21 inches carrying, weighing 2,800 pounds. The stopper is fixed by two forged bolts 31⁄2 inches in diameter, and by this arrangement no uneven stress on the stopper is possible. A disc crank is used with appropriate counterweight, specifically adapted to the weight and speed of the saddle; a five-inch hammered steel wrist pin, and a forged pitman of the most approved model, with the best composition boxes."
"The gas producer is a brick cylinder enclosed in a malleable iron housing. It is 7'6"" deep, and 3' in diameter, which becomes reduced to 20' high, where it is closed by a cast iron lid, which is continuous with the floor of the retort house. There are no fire bars at the bottom, so that the fuel rests on a brick floor of fire. At the bottom of the producer's walls there are several holes about 1' in length per 6"" high. By means of these openings, any clinker that can form and the ashes of the spent fuel can easily be removed. They also allow the intake of air to maintain combustion in the lower part of the fuel mass; and at each opening there is a malleable iron tube to deliver a steam jet directly from a steam boiler."
"There are many other conditions that Mr. Booer, after consulting with practical bakers and others, has begun to fill up, the observance of which lends himself to the current Blackfriars experience a lot of his interesting character. Thus, it has been observed that, although it is not difficult to build an oven in a given place, and to cook bread in it, it can really not be called a baker's oven. By this term must be included in particular an oven in an ordinary bakehouse, put in the usual style and worked by a man with his life to pass there. Before the problem of extending gas to baker's ovens could be considered as solved, he had to be attacked of this aspect. Mr. Booer, to give him full credit, seems to have appreciated this fact early in all his bearings. He did not only see that it was necessary to save gas, as far as possible, by putting it inside the oven; but he was told that, in order to achieve a general success, the cost of converting a furnace must be strictly maintained to a ten-hole system."
"These houses are located in a pleasant part of Headingley, which is the preferred residential suburb in the locality of Leeds. As for the accommodation, the ground floor of each house includes drawing and catering rooms of good size, each with windows; entrance halls well lit, opening on wooden verandas; kitchen, pantry and cutlery; on the first floor are three good bedrooms, a bathroom, and other necessary dwellings; on the second floor are two additional bedrooms. The basement contains coal and larder. In these houses an attempt was made to produce well-appointed and well-appointed houses, combined with a pleasant and picturesque exterior, without implying a great expense of money. The materials used are the brick of a deep red color for the faces, red terracotta of Messers. Wilcock & Co., of Burmantofs, for moulded ropes, sills, etc., and a very spare use of stone from the Harehills quarries."
"The owners of the property are, as is the case in other places outside Paris, unscrupulous and striking to the last degree, and have not only divided and subdivided the housing whenever possible, but have even raised the rental in almost all cases. Whole families are congested in a small apartment, cold cold in winter, an oven in summer, the only air and light of day that reaches the interior coming from a window that looks at a dirty staircase or even more unsanitary court with wastewater. There are currently in Paris 3,000 dwellings that have neither stove nor fireplace; more than 5,000 lit only by a skylight; while in 4,282 rooms there are four children under 14 years old; 7,199 with three children; and 1,049 with four beds in each. The Parisian population has increased by only 15 per cent."
"Koenig has also discovered the laws of the resulting sounds produced by intervals other than octave, and has extended his research to different intervals of any number of vibrations, as can be seen in the table above. His conclusion is that the resulting rhythms and sounds are one and the same phenomenon. Thus, for example, the lowest number of vibrations capable of producing a musical sound is 32 per second; similarly, a clear musical sound is produced by two simple notes of sufficient intensity that produce 32 beats per second. Koenig has also made a very ingenious modification of the siren to allow Seebeck to sound simultaneously notes whose vibrations had a given ratio. It is provided for this purpose with eight discs, each of which contains a number of circles of holes arranged at different angular distances. A description of this instrument, which is also the property of the Stevens Institute, and of Seebeck's experiments is thus given in a letter from Koenig himself."
"The metal can be obtained by reducing its sesquioxide by carbon to an extreme heat. Manganese forms no less than six different oxides--viz., protoxide, sesquioxide red oxide, binoxide or peroxide, manganic acid and permanganic acid. Protoxide occurs as a green olive powder, and is obtained by inflammation of manganese carbonate in a hydrogen current. Its salts are colourless, or pale pink in colour, and have a strong tendency to form double salts with ammonia salts. Carbonate forms the mineral known as manganese epare. Sulfate is obtained by heating peroxide with sulphuric acid until there is a low inflammation, dissolution of the residue in water and crystallization. It is used in large part in the calico printing. Silicate occurs in various minerals."
"The Government of South Australia's resolution to encourage the reproduction of the ostrich came very opportunely for the merchants of Cape, and one or two shipments of birds were shipped to Adelaide. The climate of the two colonies is very similar, and the locality chosen for the imported birds (the Musgrave Ranges) resembles the drought and temperature of their native habitat. The first opposite sketch depicts the ostriches in farewell to their South African house. ""The dear old farm where we were raised, goodbye!"" One of the boxes, while being thrown from the cart to the hold, entered a inclined position. This scared one of the two inmates, a beautiful dick. He struck so hard that he opened the door of his cage, which was, of course, immediately descended on the bridge. Fortunately, there was a man who understood how to handle the ostriches."
"An ordinary mat with reference points may, in most cases, be sufficient for the observation of the wind during the day; but different means must be used to obtain automatic transmission of the van indications inside a building. The various systems used for this purpose consist of gears, or are accompanied by friction which reduces the sensitivity of the apparatus, in particular when the rod has to pass through several stories. Mr. Emile Richard, inspector of the Versailles waterworks, has just designed an ingenious system which, while considerably reducing the weight of the moving part, allows the mat to preserve all its sensitivity. This device consists of two main parts, one fixed and the other mobile. The stationary part is designated in the accompanying figure by the letters A and B and by the cross scratches. This forms the rod or the support. An iron tube, T, with clamps, P, at its lower end forms the base of the apparatus, and is hidden, after the installation of the apparatus, by the coating of zinc ornament, Z."
"In 1861, I used a horse fork for the first time. The hay season was not bright, and our clover was drawn a little greener than usual, and entered into the muzzle in large compact forks. The result was intense heating, and therefore very rapid evaporation and sweating of the muzzle. On a bay usually holding twenty tons, we put at least thirty tons, as each load at the top seemed to make room for another. The barn was rather open, which allowed a completely free evaporation from all sides as well as at the top. The result was that I had very bright and excellent hay at the bottom, top and sides of this muzzle, but several tons at the center were as carbonized as burned in a coal pit. What always prevented the combustion was a mystery for me."
"This beautiful Agave is now in bloom in the garden here, and I am happy to be able to send you pictures of it. This is the first time it has ever bloomed in cultivation, and it has never been seen in flower in a wild state. It is a mature native specimen cultivated, dense in clothing, and perfectly semi-spherical in shape, and the leaves are arranged spirally with as much regularity as those of a viscous pine. The circumference of the plant is 5 feet 1 in., and it has 268 leaves. Its flower stem appeared about the middle of June, grew quite fast until it was 7 feet high, then slowly enough until it reached its full development. The landscape is now 10 feet 4 in. high above the plant, 61⁄2 in. in circumference at the base, or 51⁄4 in. at one foot above the base; from there, it falls very gradually to near the apex. The flower spike is excessively dense, and 5 feet 8 in. at the bottom or naked part. 4 feet."
"The building known as Pantheon, in Rome, is one of the most preserved specimens of Roman architecture. It was erected in 26 B.C., and is now about nine hundred years old. It was consecrated as a Christian church in the year 608. Its rotunda is 143 feet in diameter and also 143 feet tall. Its portico is remarkable for the elegance and number of its Corinthian columns. Señor Felipe Poey, famous Cuban fishyologist, has recently done a comprehensive work on the fishes of Cuban waters, in which he describes and depicts no less than 782 distinct varieties, although he admits some doubts about 105 kinds, about which he has not yet obtained more accurate information. However, more than half of the remaining 677 species, which he first described in previous work on this subject, which was the study of his life."
"According to the Greek engineer, there were several kinds of puppet shows. The oldest and the simplest one consisted of a small stationary box, isolated on each side, in which the scene was closed by doors which automatically opened several times to display the various paintings. The program of the performance was generally as follows: The first painting showed a head, painted on the back of the scene, which moved the eyes, went down and raised them alternately. The door having been closed, and then opened again, one could see, instead of the head, a group of people. Finally, the scene opened a third time to show a new group, and this ended the performance. There were then only three movements to be made, that of the doors, that of the eyes, and that of the change of background. Since these representations were often given on the scenes of the great theatres, a method was devised later to start the case of the behind the scenes behind which he was asked of the spectators, and to move automatically to the front of the scene, where he successively displayed the various paintings; after which he automatically drove them back behind."
"The torpedo is placed in a tube located in the front part of the torpedo vessel, from which it is driven by compressed air. Once fired, it is headed under the surface to the point where the shock of its point is to cause an explosion, and the torpedo vessel is thus able to operate remotely and avoid the dangers of immediate contact with the enemy. Unfortunately, this advantage is compensated by serious disadvantages; because, first, each of the Whitehead torpedoes costs about ten thousand francs, not counting the costs of obtaining the right to use the patent, and, second, its action is very uncertain, since the currents change very easily of direction. However, this may be, the inventor has realized a considerable sum by selling his secret to the various maritime powers, most of which have adopted his system. All our ports are equipped with flotillas and torpedoes, and with schools in which officers and men in charge of this service are trained by frequent exercises."
"The friction of the water against the polished surfaces on the sides of the vessel has not yet been measured directly, but some indirect experiments allow us to consider the related resistances as weak. The total power spent on the progress of the vessel is then used only to move certain bodies of water and to give them some acceleration. The moving bodies of water depend on the submerged surface, and their acceleration depends on the speed of the vessel. Mr. Pictet has studied a form of vessel in which the greatest possible part of the bodies of water in motion must receive vertical acceleration, and the smallest possible part of a horizontal acceleration; and this is the reason why: All the bodies of water which must receive a vertical acceleration of the keel will tend to move downward and produce a vertical reaction applied to the very surface that gives rise to the movement."
"As the volume between the two pistons varies according to the position of the latter, annoying backpressures could result without the care being taken to connect the chamber with a tank of ten times more capacity, which is formed by the interior of the frame. This results in almost constant backpressure. The type of engine under consideration, which we represent in the accompanying plate, has remarkable simplicity. The number of parts is reduced to the most extreme limits; it operates at high speed without noticeable wear; it does not require these frequent repairs that many other cheap engines do; and the expansion of steam is used without causing violent shocks in the parts that transmit the movement. Finally, the clarity of the whole device is perfectly in line with the uses for which it was designed."
"The switch is unique, consisting of only three segments of a copper ring, while in the simplest of other DC generators several times that number exists, and often 120! segments are to be found. These three segments are made so that they can be removable in a moment for cleaning or replacement. They are mounted on a metal support, and are surrounded on all sides by a free air space, and therefore cannot lose their isolated state. This characteristic of air insulation is peculiar to this system, and is very important as a factor of durability of the switch. In addition, the switch is supported by supports worn in flanges on the shaft, which the flanges, as an additional safeguard, are coated with hard rubber, one of the best known insulations. It can be declared, without fear of contradiction, that no other switch made is so completely isolated and protected."
"As soon as the frame is drawn, the spring, R, which is attached to it presses against the fixed metal rod, T, and thus gives the electricity a shorter journey than it would preferably take. The current then stops passing through the bobbins, the demagnetization occurs, and the spring that holds the frame separates again. The current now passes for a second time in the bobbins and produces a new action, etc. There is no more, then, no interruption of the current, and the movements of the hammer are caused by the change in the direction of the current, which crosses alternately and leaves the bobbins. In a communication addressed to us on the subject of these bells, Mr. Lippens adds some details on how the earth pile is applied to the microtelephonic stations."
"The nature of the developer used has, of course, some influence on the sensitivity of the plates; but in the above cases, it is assumed that the oxalate developer, without any addition, is used; or pyro., to which ammonia is added at intervals of about thirty seconds, so as to produce a slight tendency to fog; the development time being three to four minutes. The figures are supposed to be read after fixation, the plate being kept against the sky. Schumann's assertion that a gelatine bromide plate is less sensitive when developed at 30°C. than when developed at 5°, is contested; Dr. Eder's more recent investigations to demonstrate that a developer at a high average temperature acts much faster than when the temperature is low; but when sufficient time is given to each developer to penetrate the film completely, the difference becomes less apparent."
"The demand for good carpet designs far exceeds the supply, and American manufacturers send hundreds of thousands of dollars of drawings to Europe, particularly to England and France. If the same quality of drawings could be made in this country, the manufacturers would be happy to sponsor home skills. A single carpet company pays $100,000 a year for its design department, and this sum goes to foreign markets. More technical knowledge is needed for carpet design than for any other industrial design. It is necessary to have a fair knowledge of the trades, colour currents, and how to weave. So far, this knowledge has been very difficult, if not impossible, for women to obtain."
"The Pintsch gas is prepared by distillation of heavy oils in an oven composed of two superimposed retorts. The oil to be volatilised is contained in a vertical tank, which carries a curved pipe which enters into the upper retort. The flow of the oil is regulated in this duct by means of a micrometric screw which allows to vary the supply according to the temperature of the retorts. In order to facilitate the vaporization, the oil flow begins from a cast-iron bowl, and from there extends into a thin and uniform layer in the retort. The distillation residue remains almost entirely in the reservoir, from which they are easily removed. The vapour of the oil which is untied in the vessel goes to the lower retort, in which the transformation of the material is completely completed. Leaving the latter, the gas enters the drum at the lower part of the furnace. To prevent the suffocation of the pipe, it is supplied with a joint authorization of dilation."
"The first principle is that the existence of the energy of the electric currents, as well as the energy of the magnetic attractions, must not be so sought in the wire that carries the current, or in the steel or iron bar that we call a magnet, as in the space that surrounds the wire or bar. 2. The second fundamental principle is that the electric current is, in a sense, as much a magnetic fact as an electric fact; and that the wire that carries a current through it has magnetic properties (as long as the current flows) and can attract pieces of iron to itself as a steel magnet. 3. The third principle to be taken into account is that to do any work, mechanical or electrical, one must spend energy to a certain amount."
"In the same way, the tidal wave produced by the moon is the means by which part of the energy stored in the earth is required to be spent in labor. Let me illustrate it by comparing the earth rotating on its axis with the flying wheel of an engine: The flying wheel is a kind of tank, in which the engine pours its power at each stroke of the piston. The various machines of the mill simply pull from the accumulated power in the flying wheel. The earth is like a gigantic flying wheel detached from the engine, but always connected with the machines of the mill. In this powerful flying wheel a large amount of energy is stored, and a large amount of energy would be given before this flying wheel stops. The rotation of the earth is a reservoir from which the tides draw the energy they need to do the work."
"The tube that communicates with the vessel, F, is put in communication, after the latter has been completely filled with water, with the point of the tail, B. Then, the latter is opened, as well as the tail of the clamp on the rubber tube, and the water is allowed to enter the burette from the bottom until the level is zero of the graduation. There are then 100 cubic centimetres in the burette. The superfluous gas escaped through the tail, A, and passed through the water in the funnel. The cock, A, is then closed by turning 90°. To pass the absorbent liquid into the burette, the water in the graduated cylinder is made to flow by connecting the rubber tube, S, from the bottle, S, with the point of the burette. The cock is opened, and the suction is carried out with the mouth of the tube, R. When the water is released to almost the last drop, B is closed and the suction bottle is removed."
"The problem of how coal waste is to be used has been solved in the manufacture of an artificial agglomerated fuel, which is increasingly used in railways and steamboats, in industries, and even in domestic heating. The qualities that a good agglomerated machine must have are as follows: 1. Very simple, to the extent that it is called to operate in an atmosphere full of coal dust, step and steam; and, under such conditions, it is important that it can be easily obtained for cleaning, and that the change of its parts (which wear quickly) can be carried out without, so to speak, interrupting its operation. 2. Compression must be powerful, and that the product can be homogeneous, must operate progressively and not by shocks. Above all, it must act as much as possible on the whole surface of the conglomerate, and this is something most machines cannot do. 3. The removal of the mould must be easily affected, and not dependent on a set of pistons or springs, which quickly becomes null, and whose operation is very irregular."
"It will not be exaggerated to say that this coke circuit breaker is by far the simplest, strongest and most economical device of its kind today manufactured. That it does its job well is proven by experience; and the advantages of its construction are immediately evident when comparing its simple drum and one pin with the flying hammers or flipping jaws, or double drums with toothed gear that characterize some other models of the same factory class. It should be noted, as already indicated, that it is not to be excluded from the size of the machine chosen here for illustration, that it can be made from any size up to manual power."
"But by taking the precaution of installing a simple automatic flush to divert the stream until the roofs have been completely washed, it becomes possible to ensure a good supply of clean and usable fresh water, even in London. Several forms of hunting have been designed, some of which are so complex that they offer any prospect of rapid disorganization; but a simple and efficient apparatus is depicted in Engineering by a correspondent who signifies himself as ""Millwright"", and as we have proven in depth the value of a device that is virtually identical, we reproduce the substance of his communication. A gentleman of Newcastle, a retired banker, having tried various filters to purify the rainwater collected on the roof of his house, had the idea of not allowing any water to flow into the tank until the roof was properly washed."
"One of the main drawbacks of the furnaces for the regeneration of animal coal was that they did not have an automatic dryer to dry the black at its outlet from the washing machine. To remedy this, Mr. Schreiber was led to invent the automatic drying system shown at the top of the oven, which consists of two undulating pipes, such as the retorts, with openings over their entire length for the evacuation of the steam. Between these pipes there is a closed space in which between the heat of the waste and the combustion products of the oven. The latter then escape through the chimney at the top. In order for the black to be placed in bags on the outlet of the oven, it must be cooled as far as possible. For this purpose there are two pieces of rectangular cast iron tubes on each side of the oven, forming an extension of the retorts and making with them an angle of about 45 degrees. The ends of these tubes end up in hollow rotary cylinders, which allows the flow of black to be regulated in a car running on rails."
"Wrap the tub or barrel in blankets or sheep skins, and store it for a week in a warm and dry place, during which the mixture slowly turns into soap, giving a product of about 120 pounds of excellent potash soap. If this soap is made with tallow or grease, it will be almost as hard as soda soap. When made by farmers or suif or fat households will usually be taken, as it is the cheapest, and ready to hand on site. For manufacturers, or to make soap of laundry, nothing could be better than seed cotton oil. A magnificent soap can be made with this item, lathering very freely. When made with oil it is better to remel in a kettle the potash soap, made in the above directions, with half of its water weight, using very little heat, constantly stirring, and removing the fire as soon as the water is mixed with and taken by the soap."
"At the end of the last century, Humphry Davy observed that by placing a very fine gauze of wire on a flame, it was cooled to a point where it could not cross the meshes. This phenomenon, which he attributed to the conductivity and radiant power of the metal, he soon used in the construction of a lamp for miners. A few years later, Chevalier Aldini of Milan designed the idea of making a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an envelope which should allow a man to enter the midst of the flames. This envelope, which was made of metal gauze with 1-25th of mesh inch, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between him and the inner hood of which I will speak; (2) a coirass with braces; (3) a skirt for the lower part of the belly and thighs; (4) a pair of boots formed by a double wire gauze; (5) a shield of five feet long and a half wide metal frame."
"Among the attractions of the festival was an apparatus for the concentration and use of solar heat, and, although the sun was not very bright, I saw this device move a printing machine that printed several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the Sun Journal. The rays of the sun are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the same rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting up the mobile steam engine at work. As it can be assumed, the only object was to demonstrate the possibility of using concentrated heat from solar rays; but I examined it closely, because the apparatus seems very useful in the existing circumstances. Here, in France, indeed, there is a radical disadvantage - the sun is often covered. Thousands of years ago the idea of using solar rays must have been suggested, and there are still wild tribes that do not know any other way of burning; but the scientific application was absent."
"The tree is dioecious, carrying male kittens on one plant, female on another. All the female trees in Europe are supposed to come from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secures the grafts and distributes them throughout the continent. Nevertheless, the female tree is rarely encountered, compared to the male; but it is quite possible that a tree that usually produces male flowers only sometimes carries female flowers. We have no evidence of this in the case of Gingkgo, but it is quite common in other dioecious plants, and the presence of a fruit specimen near Philadelphia, as Mr. Meehan recently noted, can be attributed to this cause. The tree whose figure we give Broadlands, Hants, grows, and is about 40 feet tall, with a trunk measuring 7 feet of circumference at 3 feet from the ground, with a propagation of branches measuring 45 feet. These dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases."
"The most interesting change reflected in the census is the increase in the number of farms, which has almost doubled in 20 years; the population of the country has not increased in the same proportion; much of the increase in the number of farms has been due to the division of large farms, and this has not been the case, as some imagine, exclusively in the southern states and in the states where immigration and migration have recently been directed; it is important to note that the increase in agricultural holdings has continued even in the older northern states, although the change has not been as significant in those states as in the distant western or southern states."
"It is therefore likely that a new bag of grapes, the invention of Mr. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque, Paris, intended to serve a double purpose, namely, to protect the fruit and to hasten its maturity, will be welcomed in this country when it is known. It consists of a square of curved glass so attached to the bag that the rays of the sun are concentrated on the fruit, thus making its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality in general. The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light wire support. It covers this part of it next to the sun, so that it increases the amount of light and warms the grapes without burning them, result due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it and the bag. Mr. Pelletier had the idea of making these bags cheaper by using simple squares rather than curved squares, but the advantage thus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative inefficiency."
"On August 15, ""Jack"" Shedd, the original discoverer of the Robinson mine in Colorado, was prospecting on the southern branch of the northern fork of the Perche River, when he made the first large strike in the district. On the top of a heavily wooded ridge, he found some small pieces of native silver, then a piece of ore containing very pure silver in the form of sulphides, weighing 150 pounds, and then proved to be on the average of 11 dollars a pound. All this was only float, simply lying on the surface of the ground. After that, another block, weighing 87 pounds, of horn silver, with specimens of nearly 75 percent of money. The strike was kept secret for a few days."
"Finally, we claim, through the use of this invention, to be able to rotate any fibrous material that can be drawn by air currents, of any required degree of softness of twist, as it can be spun by any mule, and to do so with the attention of only children aged 12 to 14 years. We also claim increased production, because of less breakage of ends, of the yarn not being too drawn into the spinning, and an improvement in the quality of the yarn of the same cause, which will increase the production of the craft, and finally will eliminate other reprehensible characteristics of the issue of work, which so often disturb the peaceful harmony between work and capital. Mr. Goulding asked whether it had been shown that more or less power was required for the same numbers as by other methods, and Col. Webber replied that no more power was needed to move the rings than was saved by friction on the ring and the saving of the weight of the coils."
"When the gas is lit at the burner and the glass is closed, the burner begins to act at once, although a few minutes are necessarily necessary to drain before it gets all its shine. The cold air passes through the tubes provided for this purpose, and when heated to the maximum outside, by the hot smokes of the burner, they separate so easily from their heat in the air that a temperature of 1000° to 1,200° Fahr. is easily obtained in the air when it arrives inside, and begins to heat the tubes of the burner. The air tubes are placed so as to intercept the hot gases as completely as possible; and, of course, obtain heat by conduction from the sides of the ring-box. It is evident that the number and dimensions of these tubes could be increased so as to remove almost all of the heat from the smokes that escape, but for the limitations imposed, first by consideration of the actual amount of air necessary to withstand the combustion, and secondly, by leaving them to exist through the pressure of the furnace."
"About a year ago, Dr. Quinlan had seen the chewed leaves of Plantago lanceolata successfully capture a dangerous hemorrhage caused by boar bites in a situation where pressure could not be used. He had looked for the subject's literature, and he found that, although this herb is very much spoken by Culpepper and other former writers as a styptic, and alludes as such in Shakespeare's rooms, his use seems to be dead. Professor Quinlan described the appropriate varieties of plantain, and exposed the preparations made to him by Dr. J. Evans of Dublin, a state apothecary. They dried leaves and powdered leaves, preserved with glycerin, for external use; the juice preserved by alcohol, as also by glycerin, for internal use; and a green extract. He gave an account of the chemistry of juice, from which it seemed that he was not a member of the liquid's physiological tendency; and he also described the liquid's partialness in the liquid's appearance; and he described the liquid's in the form in which caused it."
"When it becomes a question of practical lighting, it is very certain that the best electric lamp will be the one that is the simplest and requires the rarest mechanical parts. This is due to such simplicity which is due to the success of the Jablochkoff candle and the Reynier-Werdermann lamp. Yet, in the first of these lamps, it is regrettable that the somewhat large and variable resistance opposite the current in its passage through two carbons which continue to decrease in length, as they burn, proves a cause of loss of light and variation in it. And it is also regrettable that the duration of carbon combustion is not longer; and, finally, it is possible to believe that the power used to volatilize the insulation placed between carbons is detrimental to the economic use of this system."
"By way of the top, the woods soon disappear, and the visitor emerges on a wild desert of delicately tinted saffron, rising from the beach to the colors of slates in soft undulation, and falling asleep on the other side towards the green pastures and in the cedar woods. All the surface of this uncorrugated mountain desert is ribbed by small waves a few inches apart, but the general appearance is of perfect softness. The sand is almost as thin as flour, and contains no mixture of dust. The foot flows only one inch or two while walking on it; the children roll on it and on its slopes, and, rising, shake until their clothes lose any trace of sand. Sometimes the gusts flow on the wild waste, raising a dense drift at a height of foot or only two, and flow like a fringe over the steep north edge."
"The hue is exquisite, but likely to fade when exposed to the sun. It is made from the great conch, common to the south of Florida and the West Indies. The shells are imported into Europe by thousands, and cut into nails, sleeve buttons and various ornaments. These conches are supposed to be the producers of pink pearls, but I have opened hundreds of them and I have failed to find a single pearl. The shell of the conch is used by the cameo. Rome and Paris are the main seats of the trade, and a huge number of shell cameos are imported by England and America, and mounted in rings, pins, etc. The one that shows a pale salmon colour on an orange soil is widely used. In 1847, 300 people worked on these shells in Paris alone, the number of envelopes used being immense. In Paris, 300,000 helmet shells were used in one year, valued at $40,000 from the bull's mouth, or $80,000, or just over $3,000."
"The air, like any other gas or combination of gases, has weight; some people who have learned that air exerts a pressure of 14.7 lbs per square inch, however, cannot realize that a cubic foot of air at the same pressure and at a temperature of 62 degrees weighs the thirteenth part of a pound, or more than one ounce; 13.141 cubic feet of air weigh a pound. In round numbers, 30,000 cubic feet of air weigh a ton; it is a useful figure to remember, and it is easily carried in the mind. A hall of 61 feet long, 30 feet wide and 17 feet high will contain a ton of air. The work to be done by a fan consists of putting a weight - that of the air in motion. The resistances involved are due to the inertia of the air and various frictional influences; the nature and quantity of these influences vary with the construction of the fan."
"With pure wax, the solution remains white; when ceresin and paraffin are present, they float on the surface of the alkaline solution as an oily layer, and on cooling they appear lighter in colour than the saponified mass, and therefore they can be estimated quantitatively. The author also gives a superficial method for determining the purity of the beeswax. This depends on the formation of wax crystals when the melted wax solidifies. These crystals form on the surface on the cooling, and are still visible after solidification when examining the surface on the side. The test succeeds better when the liquid wax is poured into a shallow tin mould. After cooling, another particular property of the wax becomes apparent."
"Another striking difference between monkeys and men is that the first never walk easily in an upright posture, but always use their arms in climbing or walking on all four like most quadrupeds. The monkeys that we see in the streets dressed and walking erect, only after a lot of drilling and teaching, just as dogs can be taught to walk in the same way; and the posture is almost as unnatural to one of the animals that it is to the other. The largest and most man-like monkeys--the gorilla, chimpanzee and orangutan--walk also generally on all four; but in these arms are so long and legs so short that the body seems to be half erect during walking; and they are accustomed to resting on the joints of the hands, not on the palms like the little monkeys, whose arms and legs are closer to an equal length, which tends even further to give them a semi-upright position."
"The butterflies appeared from early March to 13 August, at intervals of a certain duration, or in lots of males or females. I obtained a pairing of Selene on 30 June 1881, and the worms began to hatch on 13 July. The larvæ in the first stage is fine red brown, with a large black band in the middle of the body. The second stage began on 20 July; larvæ, of a lighter reddish colour, without the black band; black tubers. Third stage began on 28 July; larvæ green; the first four yellow tubers, with a black ring at the base; other yellow tubers of orange. Fourth stage began on 6 August; larvæ green; the first four yellow tubers of gold, the other orange red tubers; the fifth stage began on 19 August; the first four yellow tubers, with a black ring at the base; the other yellow tubers, slightly shaded with orange; the first four yellow tubers of gold, the other orange red tubers; the fifth stage began on 19 August; the first four yellow tubers; the first four began on 19 August; the first four on 19 August; the fourth on 19 August."
"A novelty in the canal boats is found in Charles River, near the foot of Chestnut Street, which is calculated to attract considerable attention. It is called a pneumatic channel boat and was built in Wiscaset, Me., as designed by the owner, Mr. R.H. Tucker, of Boston, who claims to hold patents for its design in England and the United States. The specimen shown on Charles River, which is designed to be used on the canals without injuring the banks, is a simple structure, measuring sixty-two feet long and twenty wide. It is three feet deep and pulls 17 inches of water. It is driven entirely by the air, the fan of Root's No. 4 being used, the latter operating by an eight-horse motor. The air is forced to descend a central tree at the bottom, where it is diverted, and, being confined between the bowls, passes back and up, escaping at the rear through a wide orifice of nineteen feet, to form a sort of corner of air between the water and the surface of the boat."
"Very naturally, I first examined the print frame used in the ordinary photograph. This frame is extremely simple, and very well suited for its use. It is undoubtedly the best frame for the printing of blue process, when the surface of the glass is not too large. The glass is placed in an ordinary wooden frame, while the back is rigid and divided into two parts. A flat spring in the shape of an arc is fixed by a pivot at the center of each half of the back. The two halves of the back are articulated by ordinary buttocks. Four lugs are attached to the rear of the frame, and when the back is placed, the springs can be swinged, parallel to the line of the hinges, and pressed under the lugs, so that the back is pressed most severely in the centre of each half, while the glass is prevented from coming out from the rear by the resistance of the frame to its edges."
"L. Clemandot has developed a new method of treating metals, particularly steel, which consists of heating with a cherry red, compressing strongly and maintaining pressure until the metal is completely cooled. The results are so similar to those of tempering that it calls its temperance process by compression. The compressed metal becomes extremely hard, acquiring molecular contraction and grain finesse such as polishing gives it the appearance of polished nickel. Compressed steel, like tempered steel, acquires the coercive force that allows it to absorb magnetism. This property must be studied in relation to its durability; experiments have already shown that there is no loss of magnetism at the expiration of three months. This compression has no analogue but tempering. Phishing and hardening probably alters the molecular state of the metals, especially when they are practised on a metal that is almost cold, but the effect of hydraulic pressure is much greater."
"Among a cloud of proposals, experiences and inventions, two major systems are intermingled in length: the English construction of wrought iron coils, and the Prussian construction of solid steel castings. Crude iron, as you all know, is almost pure, containing but a trace of carbon. Steel, as used for cannons, contains 0.3 to 0.5% carbon; the greater the amount of carbon, the harder the steel is. Since the first days I am talking about, great improvements have taken place in the qualities of both materials, but more particularly in the qualities of steel. However, the same general characteristics were to be noted, and it can be said that England has admitted that the lower material, as being under control, less expensive and safer to rely on the lives of men; while Prussia has chosen the stronger but less manageable substance, in the hope of improving its uniformity, and making it perfectly trustworthy."
"The differences obtained in the estimation of nitrogen in the above substances are often the source of many problems. The cause of these differences is mainly due to the lack of uniformity in the material, and its being in a sufficiently fine state during combustion. The hair which is in the trade for the manufacture of fertilizer, is usually mixed with sand and dust. Wool dust often contains old buttons, wood pieces, ankles of shoes, and all kinds of things. The fertilizers of the flesh are composed of light particles of flesh mixed with the heavier bone dust. Even after taking all possible precautions for comincing these substances by mechanical means, although imperfect results are obtained, for impurities, i.e. sand, can never be mixed so intimately with particles lighter than a sample of 0.5 to 0.8 grams, as it is used in the determination of nitrogen, will correspond to the correct mean content."
"In the fall of this year, the woods and roadsides in this neighborhood (New Bloomfield) show a singular appearance due to the ravages of the black and yellow larva of the above species. It is more abundant, so I am informed, that it has never been. In some places, almost no tree of the two species to which its attack is limited has escaped. These are the black or yellow oak (Q. tinctoria) with its variety (coccinea), scarlet oak and oak scrub (Q. ilicifolia). These trees seem brown on the sides of hills a distance, because of being completely stripped of their leaves. The noise of the falling frawn of thousands of caterpillars resembles a rain. They crawl in thousands above the ground, ten or twelve being sometimes seen on a square courtyard. The springs and pools are populated by drowned specimens. They are also abundant in all parts of the county that I have visited in the past week or two------east."
"A copper wire passes to the bottom of the cell and links to mercury; this wire is covered with gutta-percha, except when immersed in mercury. The pores of the carbon plates are filled with paraffin wax. This battery was used for the first time for the purpose of using the waste solution of bichromatic batteries, a large quantity of which is disposed of before being completely exhausted. This waste is inevitable, because of the impossibility of allowing these batteries, when used for telegraphic purposes, to function until complete exhaustion or reduction of solutions has been carried out; therefore, certain precious chemicals must be sacrificed to ensure consistency in the work."
"He who feels, ""I am in possession of the truth"", how many possessions he does not give up to save this feeling! What would he not throw overboard to remain ""over,"" that is, above others who lack ""the truth""! The state in which we have done harm to others is certainly rarely as pleasant, in an unadulterated manner, as the one in which we benefit others; it is a sign that we still lack power, or that it betrays frustration in the face of this poverty; it brings new dangers and uncertainties to the power we possess and shades our horizon with the prospect of revenge, contempt, punishment, failure."
"Since the nature of the incrustation and the resulting evils have been stated, it is now necessary to consider the methods that have been designed to overcome them.These methods naturally resolve themselves in two kinds, chemical and mechanical. The chemical method has two modifications; in one the design is to purify the water in large tanks or tanks, by the addition of certain substances that precipitate all the ingredients forming the scale before the water is introduced into the boiler; in the other the chemical agent is introduced into the boiler from time to time, and the purpose is to carry out the precipitation of the saline material so as not to form solid masses of adherent scale. When chemical methods of purification are used, the latter plane is usually followed as the least annoying."
"Mr. Sauvage took the first gudgeon, Mr. Morissot the second, and almost every moment he raised his line with a small sparkling and silvery fish that was tearing at the end; they had an excellent sport. They slipped their catch delicately in a tight bag lying at their feet; they were filled with joy, the joy of having once again indulged themselves in a hobby that they had long been deprived of. The sun poured its rays on their backs; they no longer heard or thought of anything. They ignored the rest of the world; they were fishing. But suddenly, a noise of groaning, which seemed to come from the bowels of the earth, shook the ground under them: the cannon resumed its thunder. Morissot turned his head and could see to the left, beyond the banks of the river, the formidable contour of Mount Valérien, whose summit rose a puff of white smoke."
"In 1872 or around 1872, the burgers of the Republic elected Mr. Burgers their president. This remarkable man was originally from the Cape Colony, and spent the first sixteen or seventeen years of his life, he informed me once, on a herd of breeding. He later became an ecclesiastical noted for the eloquence of his preaching, but his ideas revealed themselves too broad for his congregation, he resigned from his treatment, and at a bad moment for him caught up in politics. President Burgers was a man of striking presence and striking talents, especially with regard to his oratory, which was truly of a very high class, and would have commanded attention in our own House of Commons. However, he possessed a spirit of this particularly volatile order, which is sometimes encountered in conjunction with great talents, and which seems to be completely unballasted. His intellect was of a balloon nature, and as incapable of being directed."
"For an easy and striking reading experience, I use an open tube at both ends and bent like a W. The two open arms are short and the platinum wires are attached to the highest bend. The tube is filled with hot mercury - one end being closed by a sauerkraut stopper for the purpose - and a dry mixture of 5 volumes of air and 2 volumes of carbonic oxide is introduced into the curved tube on the mercury. A little phosphoric oxide has passed an arm. After a few minutes the gases can be subjected to the spark without blowing. A little water can then be introduced by a pipette into the other arm; and if the spark is passed directly the gases ignite in the damp arm and not in the dry arm of the tube. Admixture of the inert nitrogen makes a greater amount of aqueous vapour necessary for the explosion than when only carbon oxide and oxygen in appropriate proportion are present."
"No one but a chemist can appreciate the full meaning of the short message that came to us a month ago without warning: ""Wöhler is dead!"" What should be added? No chemist has been better known or more honored than Wöhler, and no one has ever earned more distinction and honour than he. His life was composed of a series of brilliant successes, which not only forced the admiration of the world in general, but directed the thoughts of his fellow workers, and led to results of the utmost importance for science. It is impossible in a few words to give an accurate account of Wöhler's work, and to show how his life and work have been so valuable to chemistry."
"James Prescott Joule was born in Salford on Christmas Eve of the year 1818. His father and his grandfather before him were brewers, and the company, in due course, went down to Mr. Joule and his elder brother, and by them was successfully pursued until he was sold, in 1854. Mr. Joule's grandfather came from Elton, Derbyshire, settled near Manchester, where he founded the business, and died at the age of fifty-four in 1799. His father, one of many families, married a daughter of John Prescott of Wigan. They had five children, of whom James Prescott Joule was the second, and three of them were sons - Benjamin, the eldest, James, and Jean-and-two daughters---Alice and Mary. Mr. Joule's mother died in 1836 at the age of forty-eight; and his father, who was invalid for many years before his death, died at the age of seventy-six years."
"At a recent meeting of the London Physical Society, Professor Rowland of Baltimore presented a number of his new concave grids to give a spectrum of diffraction. He explained the theory of their action. Grids can be governed on any surface, if the lines are at an appropriate distance and of the appropriate shape. The best surface, however, is a cylindrical or spherical surface. Grids are solid slabs of polished speculum metal governed by lines equidistant by a special machine of the invention of Professor Rowland. A report of this machine will be published shortly. The number of lines per inch varies in the specimens shown from 5,000 to 42,000, but higher numbers can be engraved by the cutting diamond. The author designed an ingenious mechanical arrangement to keep photographic plates in sight."
"Bacteria, whether it is a major disease or a decline in health, are more or less numerous in everything we eat and drink. The germs or spores of all kinds, called termo, lineola, held, sprillum, vibriones, etc., exist in almost infinite numbers; some of the smallest are too small to be seen by the highest powers, which, being housed in all plant and animal substances, develop very quickly under favourable conditions. They develop most rapidly when decomposition begins, and seem to indicate the degree or activity of this decomposition, also precipitating. They are most numerous in faecal matter, and generally fully developed in the fresh evacuations of people of all ages. They can be clearly seen under a thin glass with high or clear light, when the material is much diluted with water."
"Most animal tissues decompose with great speed, and plant tissues, when not protected, decompose rapidly. This decomposition is essentially oxidation, since its final result is the restoration of the atmosphere of carbonic acid, which is broken in plant growth by the appropriation of its carbon. It is therefore a kind of combustion, although this term is more generally applied to very rapid oxidation, with the evolution of light and sensible heat. But, whether the process unfolds quickly or slowly, the same force is evolved which is absorbed in the growth of plant matter; and by accelerating and guiding its evolution, we are able to use this force in the production of heat, light, and their correlations, chemical affinity, motor power, electricity, and magnetism. However, the decomposition of plants may be more or less delayed, and then it takes the form of destructive distillation, the constituents reacting to one another, and forming temporary combinations, of which part is evolved, and part remains behind."
"Man is inclined to idealization. He cannot accept as ultimate the phenomena of the sensitive world, but looks behind this world in another that governs the sense. From this tendency of the human mind, the systems of mythology and scientific theories have also arisen. Through the ancient experiences of volition, passion, power and design, manifested between us, have been transplanted, with the necessary adaptations, into an invisible universe from which the influence and power of these magnified human qualities have been exercised. ""In the roaring of thunder and in the violence of the storm was felt the presence of a crier and angry strikers, and out of the rain has been created an Indra or gives rain."" It is substantially the same thing with science, whose main force is spent in the effort to bring down the veil that separates the sensitive world from an ultra-sensitive world. In both cases, our materials, drawn from the world of the senses, are modified by the imagination to meet the intellectual needs."
"As for the surface slope, it was found that its measurement, from nearly 600 tests, was so delicate that the result would be of questionable utility, which would have an impact on the application of all the formulae in which it entered. The water surface was established, on average, at a sensitive level through, non-convex, as claimed by some authors. There were 565 sets of vertical velocity measurements combined in forty-six series. The forty-six average curves were all very flat and convex downstream, except near an irregular bank, and were approximately parabolas with horizontal axes; the data determined the parameters only approximately; the maximum speed line was generally lower than the service, and was sinking into a rectangular channel, from the centre outwards to the middle of the depth near the banks. Its depression did not seem to depend on depth, slope, speed or wind; probably the air itself, being a source of continuous delay in the surface, did not cause any permanent loss of wind."
"No one in Europe dreamed that Columbus had discovered a new continent, and when Balbao, in 1513, discovered the South Sea, then it was known that Asia was beyond, and the navigators were heading their way there. On his deathbed, in 1506 Columbus still held to his illusion that he had reached Zipanga, Japan. In 1501 he explored the coast of Veragua, in Central America, still in search of the Ganges, and announced that he was informed on that coast of a sea that would carry ships at the mouth of that river, while the Cabots, under Henry VII, took possession of Newfoundland, believing that it was part of the island coast of China."
"The iron cylinder weighs 23 kilograms; but when the current has an intensity of 43 amperes and crosses 15 sections, the stress developed can reach 70 kilograms; that is, three times the weight of the hammer. Thus, the hammer obeys with absolute docility the movements of the operator's hands, as those present at the conference were allowed to see. I will add that this hammer was placed on a circuit derived from a circuit which also served to provide three Hefner-Alteneck machines (the Siemens D5) and a Gramme machine (the Breguet P.L. model). Each of these machines made 1,500 revolutions per minute and developed 25 kilograms per second, measured by a Carpenter brake. All of these devices operated with absolute independence, and had as generators the double excitation machine that was at the Exposition of Electricity."
"I saw Favre, for the first time, in Geneva, in 1872, a few days after he had assumed the responsibility of undertaking the great work. He had lived since the war on his magnificent domain of Plongeon, on the right bank of the lake. There was no need to attend the dance to reach the entrepreneur of the greatest work that had been done so far, because Mr. Favre was easy to access. We had barely spent five minutes together so we talked as we often did later after six years of knowledge. After having made known to him the subject of my visit, the desire to be counted among the staff of his company, the conversation quickly took on this tower of mirage which was at the bottom of Favre's character. ""This is the first time,"" he told me, ""I was working with the Germans, and I had not yet struck the first blow of choice on the Gotthard when they began to get rid of our contract of August 8th. Ah! this agreement of August 8th!"
"Of course, in the fluid steel poured into the mould, there is a larger stock of heat than is necessary for rolling or hammering. Not only is there the simple high apparent temperature of the fluid steel, but there is the latent heat stock in this fluid metal that is given when solidification takes place. There is no doubt, it has been suggested to many that this heat of the ingot should be used, and in fact, there have been attempts at different times and at different places to do so; but so far all these attempts have proved failures, and a kind of conviction established in the steel trade that the theory could not be achieved in practice."
"The crystals are included in the denser rock in great abundance; they are very small, rarely on a few lines of diameter, of a black iron colour, of a regular octahedral form; sometimes large crystals can be found in place or in loose disintegrated rock. I have seen them a half-inch of diameter, and a half-dozen in a small mass, thus forming an excellent specimen of cabinet. By observing where they are thickest in the rock, and cutting in this point, more or less thin crystals can be obtained. This is easily found where they are so abundant, near the equidistant points of the walk, that no difficulty should be encountered in doing so. These characteristics are interesting, and if large specimens cannot be obtained, no amount of small crystals can be split, and, as a group, used for at least one representative. Before the water jet, it is infusable, but if it is sprayed, it is slowly dissolved in the molten borix and gives a beautiful, specific globule, which is usually green."
"When we look at our atmosphere, we find that it is composed of oxygen and nitrogen. Nitrogen is not less than 80 percent of the atmosphere; the remaining 20 percent consists of oxygen, so that the atmosphere consists almost entirely of these two gases, odourless and colourless and invisible. However, the atmosphere is never free of moisture; a certain amount of aqueous vapour is always present. The quantity can hardly be indicated, because it varies from day to day and from month to month; it depends on temperature and other conditions. Then, we have the gas commonly called carbonic acid in extremely small quantities, about a part in 2500, or four hundredths of one percent. A small amount of ammonia and a small amount of ozone are also present."
"Now, modern science tells us that such changes are accompanied by manifestations of energy in one form or another, most often in that of heat, and we must therefore consider, on nitrogenous foods as contributing to the energy of the body in addition to its other functions. What are the substances that we can classify as nitrogenous? First, we have the typical example of the purest form in albumin, or egg white; and of this the name is now given to the class of albuminates. Animal albuminates are: egg albumin, muscle fibrin, or flesh, myosin, or synronin, also of animals, casein (or fat matter) of milk, and nitrogenous substances of blood. In the kingdom of vegetables, we have gluten, or vegetable fibrin, which is the nourishing constituent of wheat, barley, oats, etc.; and vegetable legumin, or casein, which is the particular substance found in peas and beans."
"The instrument consists of two permanent magnets made of horse iron, fixed parallel to each other and separated from one inch. An isolated coil or coil of wire is suspended, like the pendulum of a clock, between these permanent magnets, in such a way that the coil hangs directly in front of the four poles. A counterpoise is attached to the top of the pendulum bar, which allows to adjust the antagonistic forces represented by the action of the oscillating coil, and two springs, which are isolated from the mass, and which form an electrode of the local circuit or annunciator, while the pendulum bar forms the other. It will be easy to understand that since the coil freely cling to the center of a very strong magnetic field (formed by the four poles of the two permanent magnets), the least current sent through the coil will cause the coil to be drawn from one direction, while it will be pushed from the other, according to the polarity of the transmitted current."
"Having had the opportunity, over the last six years, to make lead plaster in considerable quantities, it has appeared to me that cotton seed oil could be used instead of olive oil, at a lower cost and with good results. The manufacture of this plaster with cotton seed oil has been called into question, because, according to some authorities, the product is not of good consistency and can be soft, sticky and dark in colour; but in my experience this is not the case. If the U.S.P. process is followed in the manufacture of this plaster, replacing the cotton seed oil with olive oil, and instead of half a pint of boiling water, one and a half pint is added, the product obtained will be as good as that of olive oil."
"Gilbert Brothers built a sawmill there three years ago. A year later, the Denison Paper Manufacturing Company, of Mechanic Falls, built a large pulp mill, which also voted for the tax exemption for ten years. The mills are valuable companions to each other. The pulp mill uses all the waste from the sawmill. A factory was quickly built by the operators. Gilbertville now boasts a post office, a store, several large boarding houses, a beautiful school house, and more than 500 inhabitants. The pulp mill employs seventy men. It operates by night and day. It manufactures 350 ropes of poplar and spruce in paste monthly. It consumes 500 ropes of wood for fuel, 45 barrels of soda ash, valued at $45 per barrel, nine loads of lime, 24,000 pounds in the car. It produces 1,000,000 pounds of wet fibre, valued at approximately $17,000 per month."
"At the time of publication of the report, the supply of farmed fish at the hatchery was estimated at 1,000 salmon trout, weighing between four and twelve pounds; ten thousand brook trout, weighing between half a pound and two pounds; thirty thousand California mountain trout, weighing between one quarter and three pounds; forty-seven hundred rainbow trout, weighing between one quarter and two pounds of weight; and a large number of hybrids produced by crossing and crossing different members of the salmon tribe. In this regard, reference is made to the interesting fact that hybrids in the fish family are not sterile."
"The parts to be assembled are made to fit precisely, either by the image or on a tower. The surfaces are moistened with the weld fluid, a smooth piece of pewter sheet placed, and the pieces pressed together and narrowly spun. The article is then heated over the fire or by means of a lamp until the sheet of tin melts. In this way, two pieces of brass can be welded together so well that the joint can hardly be found. With good soft solder, almost all kinds of solder can be made on a lamp without the use of a ""copper"". If several pias must be welded on the same piece, it is good to use the fusibility in a different way. If the first piece is welded with fine solder consisting of 2 parts of lead, 1 tin and 2 bismuth, there is no danger of fusion when another place near it is soldered with bismuth solder, made of 4 parts of lead, 4 tin, and 1 bismuth, for their first fusion can not be melted, for their first fusion only."
"When you want to place one of the telescopes in a given position (e.g. its zero position), without acting on the alidade, you can do so by acting directly on the telescope itself without the intermedium of the winch. For this reason, you must interrupt the communication with the mechanism by pressing the button, q. If the telescope is turned on one side or the other of its normal position, by having it describe an angle of 90°, it will not stop, and these two positions will allow to determine the direction of the base. The alidades themselves are equipped with a button that disables the toothed sector of the endless screw, and allows them to be turned towards a mark made on the table. A regulating screw allows this operation to be carried out very precisely. In the foregoing, we have assumed a case where the mobile point is seen by two observers, and in which the table, T, is stationed at a remote place from them. In some cases, only two stations are used."
"The problem thus proposed can be solved by means of electricity. Take a cup like the one that supports the pipe, and rub it quickly against your mantle sleeve, in order to electrify the glass by friction. After this, bring the cup inside about one centimeter of the pipe stem. The latter will then be seen to be strongly attracted, and will follow the glass around and finally fall from its support. This curious experience is a nice variation of the electric pendulum; and it shows that pipe-clay--a very bad conductor of the electricity--favours very well the attraction of an electrified body. Tumblers or cuplets are to be found in each house, and a clay pipe is easily bought anywhere. It would therefore be difficult to produce electricity manifestations more easily and at a lower cost than by the means described here."
"The surgeon Major Roehring, of Amberg, reports, in No. 32 of the Allg. Med. Centr. Zeit., April 22, 1882, a case of long-standing headaches, which he heals with sodium salicylate, which confirms the observations of Dr. Oehlschlager, of Dantzig, who first asserted that we possess in salicylic acid one of the most reliable remedies for neuralgia. It cannot surprise us if we remember that the action of salicylic acid is, in more than one respect, and especially in its influence on nerve centers, analogous to quinine."
"There was a considerable complaint last season from wheat farmers in the tributary sections in Minneapolis, due to the rigid grading standard adopted by millers in Minneapolis. It was stated that price differentiation between grades was unfairly large and out of proportion to the difference in actual value. To determine whether or not this was the case, the Blue Earth County Farmers' Association, Minn., decided to have samples of each grade analyzed by a competent chemist to determine their relative value. Therefore, samples were obtained, certified by the Minneapolis Millers Association agent, and sent to the University of Minnesota for analysis. The analysis was conducted by Professor Wm. A. Noyes, Ph.D., an experienced chemist, who recently reported the following: ""The wheat analyses given below were undertaken to determine whether miller grades corresponded to a real difference in the chemical character of wheat."
"A lecture on ancient Greek painting was recently given by Professor C.T. Newton, B.C., at the College University in London. The lecturer began by reminding his audience of the lectures on Greek sculpture, from the early days to the Roman period, which he completed this year. The main periods of the history of ancient sculpture had an intimate connection with the general history of the Greeks, with their intellectual, political and social development. We could not study favourably the history of ancient sculpture, except in the context of the collateral study of ancient life as a whole, and we could not obtain a clear idea of the history of ancient sculpture without tracing, to the extent our imperfect knowledge permits, the characteristics and successive stages of ancient painting."
"""The main incrustation generators in the boilers are gypsum and calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. If water can be extracted from it before it enters the boiler, the incrustation formation is made impossible; all disturbances and disturbances, derived from these incrustations, are eliminated with, and moreover, a considerable fuel saving is possible, because the clear iron leads the heat faster than that which is covered with incrustation."" J. Kolb, according to Dingler's Polyt. Journal, says: ""A boiler with clear sides delivered with 1 oven. coal 7.5 furnace. steam, after only two months 6.4 furnace. steam, or a decrease of 17 percent. At the same time the boiler has suffered from continuous work."" Suppose that a free boiler of the inside crust would produce a savings of only 5 percent. in the fuel (and this figure is taken very low compared to the practical experiments) it would be at the same time an economy of 3c. per cubic metre of water. So if the cleaning of 3c. costs less than a cubic metre."
"In the last part of April fifty-three granite masonry courses, rising to the height of seventy feet above the high water, had been laid, and thirty-six courses remained to be put. The old lighthouse had already been surmounted. As the work progressed towards completion the question arises: What will be done of the famous tower of John Smeaton, who has done such an admirable service for 120 years? One proposal is to bring it back to the top of the solid portion, and to leave the rest as a perpetual memory of the great work that Smeaton has accomplished in the face of much greater obstacles than those facing the modern architect."
"According to Alex. Guillaumot the aircraft was of a kind of railway on which the car was moved by manual work. In the car, which was decorated with royal colors, are seen sitting the ladies and children of the king's house, while the king himself stands at the back and seems to direct the operations. The remarkable feature to which we would direct the attention of the reader is that this document shows that the car was running on rails almost like those used on the railways of the time, and that a rotating table served to change the direction at a right angle in order to place the car under the shelter of a small building. The image that we reproduce, and whose authenticity is certain, then proves that at the time of Louis XIV. our current turning tables of railway had been designed and built--which is a historical fact worthy of note."
"From the tower, the veneer is moved to the cutting table, where it is cut in lengths and widths as desired. It is then transported to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, tight air, except when the air reaches them by the appropriate channels. The veneer is placed here in boxes, each room is separated and standing on the edge. The warm air is then lit. This comes from the iron sheet furnace fixed to the boiler in the engine room below, and is transported by large pipes regulated by shock absorbers to put or remove heat. There is also a fan attached that keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools through an exhaust pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is maintained at approximately 165°, and so fast is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green grume of the steam box is shaved, packed, packed, dried, and packed, and packed."
"The loss resulting from the charge and discharge of this battery is not great; for example, if a certain amount of energy is spent in the charge of the cells, 80 per cent. of this energy can be reproduced by the electricity resulting from the discharge of the cells; moreover, the battery can be transported from one place to another without injury. A battery was recently charged in Paris, then taken to Brussels, where it was used the next day without charging. The cost is also said to be very low. A quantity of electricity equal to a power of one horse for an hour can be produced, stored and delivered at any distance within a radius of 3 miles of the work for 11⁄2d. Therefore, these batteries can become useful in the production of electric light in private homes."
"To produce the electric current, all that is necessary is to lower these elements hanging down in the hollow, having previously connected the wires to the electric lamp. At the same time a light begins, between the carbon pencils of a power of a thousand candles or more. With a light of this power, a large head on cabinet or card of the size of the plate can be produced in three or four seconds. The generator occupies a floor space of three feet six inches by two feet, and stands two feet six inches high. The cells will cost 5s. to be charged, and will produce more than sixty negatives before being exhausted. All that is necessary, while recharging, is to lift the elements out of the road, remove the hollows by their handles and empty them, again load them by means of a pot of toilet. Once replaced, the entire device is able to be used again; the whole operation above occupies but a quarter of an hour, and since there are no used terracotta cells, there is no fear of rupture."
"If the weather conditions in the Northwest have allowed the breeding of winter wheat as good as that which was raised in the winter wheat sections in general, I doubt that we should hear so many new processes and progressive reduction systems today. As long as the vast majority of our bread supply came from winter wheat fields, progress was very slow; the mills of 1860, and I could even say from 1870, being little in advance, in terms of processes, of those built half a century earlier. The reason for this lack of progress can be found in the ease with which winter wheat could be transformed into good, white and merchant flour."
"Crafty studied the ways of the human race for many years. According to him, the man was created for the benefit of the rats. He had known men almost as devious as rats; but on the whole he looked at them as inferior beings. Simple, who lived near them, also had a great disdain for men and women. He often boasted that he had obtained his board and lodging all at their expense. But he did not know half as much as he thought; and many times he had been prevented from getting into a beating by his good friend Crafty. One evening, around twelve o'clock, Crafty and Simple began to see what they could find."
"Walter did not notice this until he was far enough from the shore; then, turning, he saw what had happened. Every moment the current carried him away from the house. Walter was not a shy boy, and instead of crying, he began to reason this way: ""The boat does not run away. It is safe and healthy. There are no waves to scare me. The wind does not blow. Here on a seat is a thick blanket. In this box is a bread and a knife. The water of the river is good to drink, and here is a tin cup. I think I will not cry, but I hope for the best."" Then he sat down. He called people on the shore; but they did not hear it. He rose up, and waved his hat to a man in a passing boat, and cried, ""Help, help!"" But the man thought he was a little boy who was mocking him."
"One night, after spending the day in the Catacombs, which are nothing more than the cities of the dead, under the ground, and having stumbled on my companions, and trampled on the heels of the guide, I came home in the hope of a quiet and peaceful evening. However, finding an invitation to spend this evening with a lady who lived at the other end of the palace, I felt obliged to accept it. As I passed along the dark and narrow entrance, which seemed to pass through the Catacombs again, I heard a beat, a beat, a beat, a beat, a beat, a beat, on the brick floor. I supported myself by putting my hands out until they touched the sides of the tube, for I was just the least frightened. The noise approached me; but I did not dare turn my back. He echoed from the walls and the high ceiling, and all the air seemed to be filled with a strange sound."
"In the first place, there was Rover, the big brown puppy. Georgie had not taken three steps, when Rover spyed on the bread, and, thinking that it was for him, began to jump after. Georgie thought that he should return home; but, seeing a stick on the ground, he brought it back, and shook it at Rover. Rover was afraid of the stick, and ran gently away. Nothing else happened to disturb Georgie until he reached half the walk. Then he encountered another difficulty. Two large turkey gobblers, looking very red around the head, and with feathers all stifled, rushed to him for the bread, shouting, ""Gobble, gobble!"" in a frightening way. Georgie hesitated. Osa did he overcome them? ""Gobble, gobble!"" squeaked the turkeys."
"After lunch, they ran for ""specmens"", by which they heard beautiful stones. They cut pieces of rocks with hammers, playing what they were miners finding gold and silver. They filled their baskets and claimed to have made great fortunes. They kept the sport until five o'clock, when their mothers said it was time to start at home, and counted the children to see if all were there. Only five could be found. There should have been six. Who was missing? It was four years old Willie. ""Willie, Willie!"" each shouted, and the great red rock came a weak answer. Then they began to ""cassing and looking"" seriously, and soon they spyed on the little boy sitting on the side of the rock five meters high. ""Why, Willie!"" called his mother. ""What are you doing here?"""
"Mrs. West looked into the crib and the rooms, but saw nothing of the little girl. Then she went down the stairs and looked into the living room and the room. Lily was not there. She opened the front door and called ""Lily, Lily!"" but still in vain. Finally, she went down to the dining room, and there, to be sure, Lily slept quickly in a large chair, with Dinah the kitten in her knees, and a small black paw wrapped in her potty hand. Mrs. West smiled and closed the door gently, saying, ""Dear child, she certainly does not hurt."" Then she called her sister to come to bed and pee the sleeping companions. Helen said, ""Is that not a nice picture? Suppose we take a big peach from this basket of fruit and put her gently next to her on the chair to surprise her when she woke up."" When Lily woke up a little later, she rubbed her eyes, and said, ""Why, where does this peach come from?"
"Edith was four years old, and she had come the day before, for the first time in her life, to stay on a large farm. She had never seen any young chickens, except in picture books: so you can imagine how happy she was to see real live chickens. She was soon on the farm, and after feeding the little things with food and water, — hastily pudding she called her, — she seemed so long to caress them, that her kind grandmother said, ""Well, my dear, hold your apron, and I'm going to put some chickens in; but you have to handle them very gently."" Edith was delighted, and begged to carry them in the house so mom could see them."
"They build their nests in the osier beds, at the edge of the river, but out of the reach of the water. These nests are compact, beautiful, formed of wickers, or reeds. Each pair of swans has its own promenade, or district, in which no other swans are allowed to build. Each pair has a guardian designated to take over all of them. The guardian receives a small sum for each swan that is raised; and it is his duty to see that the nest is not disturbed. Sometimes he helps these seigneurial birds by building the nest foundation for them. Once a year, in August, the swans are counted and marked. This is called ""swan-upping"" and a good time that he was."
"One day a man came with a rope, and before the donkeys knew what he was doing, he threw it on the neck of the poor little Jack, and he tried to get him out. But Jack had no intention of going. Oh, my dear, no! He planted his feet firmly on the ground, while the man pulled, pulled, and pulled, but could not move him a step. Finally, the man abandoned and left; but he returned the next day with two other men. Then, despite Jack's firmness, his legs were tied, and he was laid in a wagon, and carried miles and miles away from all his dear companions. His new house was a little farm where there were no friends for him. Jack soon became so alone, that he even felt impatient to scrape the knowledge of the chickens and chickens."
"I was a negligent young child, and one day, when I was at stake on the bank of the river, I went too close to the steep bank, I fell on it, and I sank into the water. It was very deep, and there was a strong current. I had never learned to swim. I was in such a fear that I could not even cry for help. The water stifled me, and I was almost drowned, when a good logger came to float for my help. It seemed like a friend sent from my home. I was scrambling at the top of it, gagged by my sister, who was crying on the shore, and was going to drift on the river."
"On March 10, 1880, the Hebe elephant gave birth to the America of the female calf. Hebe is now twenty-eight years old, and the father of the calf, Mandrie, thirty-two. Since the birth of the ""Baby"", the mother has been in excellent health, except for ten days, when she suffered a slight indisposition, which soon left her. When the calf was born weighed 2131⁄2 lbs., and in April 1881 he weighed 900 lbs. A very fair year of growth on a milk diet. At the time, I bought the samples both mother and calf were in good health. To obtain the milk was a matter of difficulty. The calf was constantly breastfeeding, breastfeeding two or three times an hour, morning, noon and night. The milk could be drawn from one of the two trayons, but only in small quantities."
"The child's mind has the receptive side, the sensitivity, the most prominent. His senses are alert. He manipulates and examines the objects about him. He sees more, and he learns more from the sight, than he will in the years to come, unless his perceptual powers are definitely formed and they become a habit. His judgment and his will are weak. He reason imperfectly. He chooses without proper motives. He needs the edification and development given by the educational formation. Nature emphasizes the method. Sensitivity being the characteristic of his mind, we must appeal to him by his senses. We must use the concrete; through this we must act on his weak will and immature judgment. From his natural curiosity, we must develop attention. His naturally strong perceptive powers must be made stronger; they must be led in appropriate directions and fixed on suitable objects. He must be led to appreciate the relationship between the cause and the effects - to associate related facts - and to state what he knows in a precise, clear and forcible manner."
"Near the bottom of the tree, branches are removed to illuminate the main roads and the transport machinery room, the main cables being transported in one of the sections of the mine at a distance of half a mile. After a careful inspection of the lamps at the bottom of the pit, the party was photographed in three groups, using electric light, by Mr. Annan of Glasgow, who may well be credited with the distinction of being the first to exercise his competence in the bowels of the earth. They were then taken to the transport machinery room and in the works, where they witnessed the effects of light."
"The same master of engineers has undertaken a series of very interesting experiments on the sensitivity to light of one or two substances to which bitumen probably owes its sensitivity, but which, contrary to what happens with bitumen, are able to make very beautiful half-tons, both on polished zinc and on albumenized paper. These sensitive substances are extracted by dissolution of sea glue or benzine coal-tar. By exposure to light, sea glue and round coal-tar in a sepia colour, and, in a print frame, they make a visible image, which is not the case with bitumen; their solvents are in the order of their energy; chloroform, ether, benzine, terpentine, petroleum essence, and alcohol. Of these solvents, benzine is the best suited to reduce substances to a fluid state, in order to allow them to flow on zinc."
"After searching through the house, Nellie ran to the barn to look for the lost animal. Of course, there was the kitten, not taking any care of her tie, just ready to vomit on a large mouse. Nellie's voice surprised her so that she would not catch the mouse, after all. The little thug snorted in a hole before Kitty could even get her paw on her tail. But the cherry bow was still safe and without defilement. So, after giving a talk to the pussy about her disobedience, Nellie took her to the house. She met Belle at the door, and told her what she had done with a search; while the puss, cuddled in her arms, continued to purify, as much as to say, ""I'm sorry that you were displeased with me. I really thought you were congratulating me for trying to catch this great mouse; for I am not even more than a kitten."""
"One day, Susan had two girlfriends who visited her, Willy and Bessie Hill; and, as they had never seen a parrot, she proposed to take them to the bird shop; they were both delighted to go there; and Bessie took her doll and dog Snip with her. In her right hand, she wore a cake; and the first thing that the parrot said when she was going to him was: ""Polly wants a cake."" It made the little girl laugh. She laughed even more when the parrot took a piece of cake in her claw, and ate it, little by little, as pleasantly as she could. But when Snip barked at the parrot, and the parrot barked, she thought it was the most funny thing, and laughed until the tears came."
"From the balloon of fire invented by the brothers Montgolfier, in 1782 to the upper hydrogen balloon of M.M. Charles and Robert, no material progress was made, except the use of coal gas, suggested first by Mr. Green. The vast surface presented to the wind makes the balloon ingestable in each breeze, and the aircraft can only let it float with the current. It is a difficulty that has been partially overcome, as we saw during the recent electric exhibition in Paris; but no one can guide it in a direction opposite to a current of air. The aircraft must always be able to float in the direction of the current or at certain angles of its course; but doing this is even a question that has not been successfully accomplished."
"They lived in Sunland, a small town a few kilometres from Boston; and every morning Parley-voo rushed to kiss his father before he went to his business in the city. Then, when the train passed, he stood at the window, and waved his little white handkerchief, and his father returned to him, as if to say, ""Hello, again, my dear little Parley-voo, hello!"" But one morning he was so asleep, that he could not open his eyes when his nurse told him that it was time to get up. He called the nurse a maid, as they did in Paris. He pushed her, and went to sleep again, and the first thing he heard was the train that passed with a ""choo, choo, choo"", and his father went without kissing."
"Early a bright morning, three little girls who spent the summer in their uncle's farm went out to pick up wild flowers in the woods not far from the house. Just as they came to the edge of the wood, they heard the slight tangle of a lamb. They listened, keeping very still, but could not make out where the sound came from. Then Mary, the eldest of the three, said, ""Let's go each other in another way, and let's hunt until we find the poor little thing."" They did so; and in a few minutes, Lulu the youngest called the others: ""I found it! I found it! I found it! Come, Mollie and Bessie, come and help me quickly; for the dear little lamb is wounded, and I am afraid that he will die."" You can be sure that they were all running fast, and it was good that they did it; for the lamb had broken his leg, and could not have lived much more if someone had not taken care of it."
"Jimmy's dad has a hundred horses, as many cows, and a hundred sheep. He doesn't keep them in the barns, nor feed them hay, but they wander on the hills, and feed on grass in winter and summer. Mason's house is five miles from any neighbour, and fifteen miles from the city. There is no garden or fence around, and there are no trees to see anywhere near. But there are wild flowers in abundance. One of them is a species of cactus. He carries beautiful yellow flowers in summer, after which the fruit comes, a prickly pear, not good to eat."
"The great advantages of this device are as follows: 1. From the moment the lid is closed, it is possible to work in daylight. 2. The method of washing in the moving water is combined with that of complete water change. 3. The emulsion never comes into contact with the metal. 4. Anyone who wishes to prepare the dry gelatine does not need, when the washing is complete and the container is perfectly emptied, to let the emulsion flow for a period of time, then to lift the sieve and its contents and to place it in an appropriate container with absolute alcohol. The latter must be changed once, and when sufficient water has been extracted, the sieve must be removed from the container and the emulsion allowed to dry spontaneously."
"This house has no roof, no fireplace, no windows, no front door, no back door. However, it was once the home of a happy family; and if you were near it, you heard their soft low voices from morning to night. This was this little house when I visited it one day last summer. Today I called again. Everything was still. Not a voice I heard. The house without a roof was filled with snow. The walls seemed dark and sad. The leaves that once cast beautiful shadows on them had gone. As I was keen to look at the empty house, Ethel, who is very young but very wise, exclaimed: ""The family went south for the winter, but are sure to return to spring. There will be happy moments here very soon."""
"He patiently waits for the bones that reward his obedience. When they have been put on the clean ""clothing table"", he begins his pleasant feast. Dinner on, Flash takes the paper cloth, and the door out of the room for the cook to burn. Ethel says that Flash can say the hour; for just one minute of all the day, the dog comes to his master, sits straight, with his front legs crumbling gracefully, and asks, in his stupid way, something to eat. And when the time comes for his master to go down the city for business, Flash is sure to give him a tip; for Flash is very punctual, you see, and does not approve of delay. One Flash day brought an intimate friend, a red setter, and introduced him to his master. Flash stands up jerking his tail, while the caller was politely caresssed."
"We know quite well what forms the main material of thought with bees and flies, and these are visible objects. For you have to think of something if you think at all; and you can hardly imagine a contemplative breath to sit down to reflect, like a Hindu devotee, on the syllable Om, or on the uniqueness of existence. Abstract ideas are not likely to play a great role in Apian consciousness. A bee has a very perfect eye, and with this eye it can see not only the shape, but also the color, as Sir John Lubbock's experiences have shown us. The information she obtains through her eye, coupled with other ideas derived from touch, smell and taste, no doubt makes the main thinker universe and known as it is to Apian intelligence. For us and for bees as the world as a whole is a colorful image, with the notions of distance and strength launched by touch and muscle effort; but the view undoubtedly plays the first role in the overall design of things."
"Zip had a long body, low, covered with stiff yellowish hair. His nose was pointed, and his eyes were shiny like buttons. His legs were small regular hands, and he used them as hands. He was very tame. He climbed on the chair of Isabella, and scrambled on his shoulder. Then he painted his hair with his fingers, picked up his earrings, and smelled his collar, pin and buttons. Isabella's mother was very sick, but sometimes could sit on her chair and eat her dinner from a tray on her knees. She liked to have Zip in her room; but if she stayed alone with her, Zip would jump into the chair behind her, and try to trample her."
"One day Lisa was alone in the house. Her sister had fled to spend the day, and her father had gone out fishing. A strong storm went up. She rocked the house and blew the shutters, but Lisa never listened to her, because she thought of her father. After the storm, she went to the door and looked outside. An old fisherman passed by with her son. She asked him where he had seen his father before the storm, and said, ""I fear that your father's boat was driven on the rocks, for it is no longer to see."""
"MASTER BABY played in the park all morning. He chased a butterfly. He didn't catch the butterfly. But he came home with two pink cheeks and a good appetite. Now he must have his dinner. Tie him around his neck. Sit him at the table. Give him soup. Now cut him off meat and potatoes, and let him eat. He's a little awkward; but a hungry boy will soon learn how to handle a fork. Leave him for that. It won't take long to teach him how to use a knife too. Boys need a good amount of food to make them strong and hearty. Give them a lot of fresh air. Let the sun shine on them. Then they will be sure to eat with a relish."
"In order to accumulate electricity for the production of light or motor electricity, the author has disposed of secondary batteries, which differ from those of M.G. Planté. At the negative pole, he uses a sheet of palladium which, during electrolysis, absorbs more than 900 times his hydrogen volume. At the positive pole, he uses a sheet of lead. The electrolyzed liquid is sulfuric acid at a tenth. This element is very powerful, even when it is small. Another secondary element, which has also given good results, forms at the negative pole of a thin plate of iron sheet. This plate absorbs more than 200 times its hydrogen volume when it is electrolyzed in an ammonium sulphate solution. The positive pole is formed by a plate of lead, pure or covered with a layer of litharge, or pure oxide, or all these substances. These metal plates are immersed in a solution containing 50 percent ammonium sulphate. Another arrangement is at the negative pole, iron sheet; at the positive pole, iron cylinder."
"The amount of woody fibre or cellulose is considerable for rice with its snout, but only light for samples without snout. The seat of the mineral material of the rice grain is mainly in the snout, and since this ash is very valuable as a food for yeast, it is an open question if it would not be preferable to use to brew rice with its snout. The relatively larger amount of fat is contained in corn; and since this oil is not desirable for brewing, various recommendations have been advanced to release the grain from it. In the following table, some of the mineral constituents of the three types of grain are compared to each other. These data refer to 100 parts of ash, and are derived from the analysis given by Dr. Emil Wolf. The excessive amount of ash in rice with its snout is very remarkable, and since this mineral material consists of a large part of phosphoric acid and potash, most of it is soluble in water."
"The young man and the young woman spoke and laughed together while walking. They seemed to be very good friends. But what happened to the child in the car? Poor child! She fell from the seat. Her head hung on the side of the car, just in front of the wheel, and there she lay crying for help. I could not hear her screams, for I was a mile away; but the sight was sufficient for me. I seized my trumpet. ""Shipmate, hoy!"" I cried to the sailor-chap. No answer. It was obvious that the sailor-chap did not care for the slightest degree for this poor suffering child. No one offered to help him. ""Steer for the shore!"" I said to my helmsman."
"It is now a well-established fact that matter, in itself, is inert, and that its energy is derived from physical forces; therefore all the chemical and physical phenomena observed in the universe are caused by and due to the operations of physical forces, and matter, regardless of the state or state in which it is found, is only the vehicle through or through which the physical forces operate to produce the phenomena. There are only two physical forces, that is, the attraction force and the caloric force. The attraction force is inherent in matter, and tends to attract particles together and maintain them in a state of rest. The caloric force accompanies matter and tends to push particles outwards in a state of activity. The attraction force being inherent, it remains in matter permanently and cannot increase or decrease; however, it is present in different elementary bodies at different degrees, and in bodies composed in relation to the elements of which they are composed."
"I'm going to tell you what stopped him. While the ducks were swimming for the expensive life, the old mother duck came to the sail boldly, with his great yellow beak, and faced Master Carlo. She looked like a war-sloop ready for action. Carlo was a brave dog; but he was afraid of her, for all that. Then he was still and barked. Mrs. Duck didn't worry about her noise in the least. She splashed over him fiercely. That's what she wanted to say: ""Look, my young friend, you are a dog, and I'm a duck. You're home on the earth, but I'm home on the water. Bark as much as you want, but if you know what's good for your health, stay out of this pond, and let my ducks alone."" ""Do you hear that, Carlo?"" says Jane."
"After breakfast, she went to the field where the hay was doing, and she helped her with her little rake to throw it and spread it. But at eleven o'clock, her mother called her, put her night dress on, and put her in her bed for a nap, and at that time, the little girl was usually tired enough to be happy to go to sleep. But one day, she was having such a good time with a few little cousins who had come to play with her, that when her mother called her for her nap, she said, ""Oh, please, mom, don't make me go to sleep today; I'm not a little asleep. See how big my eyes are!"" Her mother laughed and said, ""Well, honey, we're going to try it once, but I'm afraid you're tired before the night."""
"She's a little English girl. Her name is Mildred, but she's usually called Milly. She's always lived in a beautiful old house, with beautiful grounds, not far from London. But now she's going, with her father and mother, in India. She thinks it'll be very nice to travel so far with them; but she's sorry to leave her good grandmother, and all her aunts and cousins. She couldn't help crying when she said good to them. ""I can't go without my Jip,"" she said to her mother the day before she left. ""Oh, no, honey!"" said her mother. ""I wouldn't want to leave the little dog behind him. He'll be a great player for you on board the ship."""
"The proclamation of the emancipation of Mr. Lincoln, who, when published, admitted with humour that he was null and void, had acquired the validity by the action of the highest authority known to our institutions, the people gathered in their various State conventions. The soldiers of the Confederation had laid down their arms, had committed themselves in good faith to refrain from further hostile operations and had dispersed peacefully in their homes; therefore, there would have been no further fears on the part of the Government of the United States. Therefore, the call for necessity could no longer exist for a hostile demonstration against the people and the States of the deceased Confederation. Did vengeance, which stops at the grave, collapse? Did the real peace and the restoration of the States to their old rights and positions follow, as promised on the restoration of the Union?"
"On a beautiful summer day, a very hungry fox went in search of his dinner. After a while, his eye rested on a young cock, which he thought he would eat well. So he lay under a wall and hid himself in the high grass, waiting for the cock to approach him sufficiently, and then he went out on him, and carried him. Suddenly, however, the cock saw him and flew away, in great fear, to the top of the wall. The fox could not bring him there, and he knew it. He went out of his hiding place, and thus spoke to the cock: ""Dear me!"" he cried, how well dressed you are! I came to invite your magnificence to a great baptism feast. The duck and the goose promised to come, and the turkey, although slightly ill, will try to come too."
"The sparrow looks up at him, saying, ""Ah, ha, Sir Hawk! You have scared me many times with your sharp claws and your hooked beak; but now I am a match for you. It was very fun for you to kill little chickens. Now you see what's coming."" ""Yes, scream the turkey, he killed seven dear chickens. How happy I am that he is finally caught! I'm going to give him a piece of my mind now, but he can't have chickens anymore."" ""Ah!"" said the sparrow, you speak very courageously; but if I had come out of this cage, you wouldn't look at me much longer."""
"In the spring, they lay their eggs. They live mainly on insects; but I have heard of a person living a whole year without eating anything. They are very patient, and I have seen a person try for hours to cross a wall that one would think he could never pass; and yet he would succeed. I have a turtle now that will have a funny story to tell his friends, if he arrives again at his native home. That's what I did: I once took him to school with me, and I left him in a box, with the cover half open, on a table in the dressing room. In about an hour I heard a laugh removed from one of the girls, and looking up, I saw Mr. Turtle walk quietly to school. He wanted to learn something as well as the rest of us."
"Jack and Fred sat on the steps, trying to think of something to do. They had spent their morning digging wells and ditches in the sand; for it was the time of the holidays, and they lived by the sea. Just before dinner, they had been swimming. Since dinner, they had been in the fields, collecting long feathery herbs to put in mom's vases. And now, what should they do next? Finally, Jack thought it would be nice to make a big kite, much bigger than any one they had ever seen. Fred said he would help; and they were running for sticks, bags, paper, dough, and rope, to have everything ready. When they could think of anything else that was necessary, they started to work. Jack cut and trampled the sticks together, as the little ones were in his little kite; while Fred cut the papers, and lined up."
"Bertie is a brave little boy: so he walks straight to the door, which stands open, and looks outside. Then he slams his chubby hands, and shouts, ""Oh, he was my uncle Frank under the table. I forgot that he was such a funny man. Oh, Uncle Frank! How can you get into the house and get out of the house, and no one sees you?"" ""Look at me here!"" said a strange barking voice from the bottom of the steps. Bertie looks, and sees something that makes her eyes brighter than ever. It's a dog big, black, chamois, attached to such a nice little express wagon. The harness adapts to its wearer as well as possible, and has rings of silver and buckles. The reins are red, white and blue. A nice whip is found through the seat of the wagon. On the sides of the wagon, in great golden letters, are the words, ""City Express""."
"The first use of alizarins for reds was for the application of styles, i.e. colors containing both biting and colouring material and fixed on the fabric by the action of steam. The good red-vapour were easily obtained using receipts originally designed for flaking extracts (mixtures of alizarin and purpurin). On the other hand, the first attempts to dye red patterns and red pieces were not crowned with success. The custom of dyeing up to a brown with flower then clearing the shade by a succession of soaps and cleanings had much to do with this failure."
"As soon as the plate is dry, a positive cliché of the drawing to be reproduced is placed on it, and the whole exposed to the sun for one minute, or to the electric light for three minutes. The reaction produced is the same as with the iron citrate, but much faster; the exposed parts are no longer hygroscopic, but in the parts protected by the lines of the drawing the sensitive coating has retained its stick, and will hold any powder that can be passed on, thus producing a very clear image of the drawing. The coating being excessively thin, the little moisture it holds and the powder applied suffices to break its continuity, especially if the powder is slightly alkaline. If the rest of the surface is sufficiently resistant, the plate could be bitten at once; but the light alone is not enough to produce a complete waterproofness: the action of the heat must be combined with it. The plate is therefore placed on a grid, with wide openings, a large flame is applied below, and it is heated until the edges where the copper is naked show iridescent colors."
"One day, when Sam was playing in the courtyard, his dad would come home from the city, with something attached to the bottom of the wagon. When he saw Sam, he stopped the horse and called, ""Sam, come here, I have something for you."" Sam ran there as fast as he could, and – what do you think? – Dad lifted up two little goats from the wagon, and put them down. A goat was black and one was white. Sam was so happy that he didn't know what to do. He just jumped up and down with pleasure. Then the dog Jack went out to see the goats too; but he didn't like them very much. He barked at them as hard as he could; but the goats didn't bother him at all. Soon Mom came to see what Sam had. When she saw the goats, she said, ""Why dad, what will be with us if we have two goats at the place?"" But she was happy because Sam was happy; and Sam gave her dad a hundred kisses to thank the goats."
"On one side of his house, there was a door that opened in a pen. The pen was in the orchard where the sweet apples were growing. Sometimes, in the summer, the apples fell from the trees in the enclosure; then the pigsty picked them up and ate them. Sometimes, they hit him on the back when they fell; but he didn't care; he was always happy to get them. He had his bed of straw warm to sleep at night, and every day he had as much as he wanted to eat. He had a whole pig that he could wish. So he was happy. One morning, farmer Jackson brought a heap of milk for the pig's breakfast. He poured the milk into the pot, and the pigry rushed to eat it. While he was eating, something hard and cold came into his mouth. He bit it, but found it not good: he left it. He ate all the milk."
"""Enter!"" said Grandma. ""What does that mean? A new expression. I have no doubt, that I have never heard before; but an old lady of eighty years cannot expect to follow the times. It is something horrible, of course."" But what was the surprise of the old lady when the boys threw their blue jackets, and two of them began to throw the ""stone"" forward and backward, one to the other; while the third boy stood between the two, striking as he was flying in the air, and sometimes striking him and sometimes not. There, they staid all afternoon doing the same thing. ""Why,"" said Grandma, putting on his glasses, and looking closer. ""I declare! they play only with the ball, after all. Well, I am glad that they are not so cruel as I thought them."
"The hulls, shaped and having a flat bottom, are constructed of iron plate of one tenth of an inch and of iron of angle 40x40. Their dimensions are: Length, 33 feet; width, 31⁄4 feet; and depth, 5 feet. The internal distance between the two hulls is 71⁄4 feet. These hulls, having bridges absolutely watertight, are connected below by flat iron fastening bars, and above by vertical stays 1 foot in length, which are used to support the boards of the floor of the deck and the boiler room floor of the engine room. The engine room, which is 191⁄2 feet long by 5 feet wide, is constructed in varnished pitch-pine, with movable shutters of teak. The roof, of thin iron plate, is supplied with a fan to allow the escape of the hot air."
"The nature of the fuel required depends on the object for which the gas is used. If for heating boilers, ovens, etc., coke or any type of coal can be used; but for gas engines or any application of gas requiring great cleanliness and the absence of sulphur and ammonia, it is preferable to use anthracite, because it does not give condensable vapours, and is very free of impurities. Good qualities of this fuel contain more than 90% carbon and so little sulphur that, for some reasons, purification is not necessary. For gas engines, etc., however, it is preferable to pass the gas through a certain hydrated iron oxide to remove hydrogen sulfide. Oxide can be used repeatedly after exposure to air, and therefore purification is carried out without odor or appreciable costs."
"This resin is a very beautiful red substance that communicates its particular color to the leather. We must mention here that in these calculations we assume that the skin is perfectly dry, water being a changing element that does not allow to achieve a precise result. These figures show the huge differences resulting from various tanning methods. Hemlock, which threatens to inundate the European markets, stands out above all. The high results attributable to the high proportion of resin that the skin assimilates, explain in part the weakness of its price, which makes it so fearsome a competitor. It is also surprised by the great return of the skins of sumac-tanned when it is recalled in how little time the tanning was carried out, which in this case took only half an hour. The figures show that the greatest yield is obtained by means of these tanning substances which are rich in resin. In short, hemlock, sumac, and pine, which give the greatest yield, are those which contain the greatest amount of resin."
"Buckwheat can be made profitable on a rough or freshly cleared piece of land: no other crop is so effective in rough and stony soil. Seeds in northern localities should be sown before July 12th; otherwise, early frosts can catch crops. Grass and clover can sometimes be successfully sown with buckwheat. London News says: ""Of all poultry farms, goose farming in favorable situations is said to be the least embarrassing and most profitable. It is not surprising that trade has been developed extensively in recent years. Geese will live and, to some extent, thrive on the most rude of grasses."" When a cow has a depraved appetite, chewing coarse, indigestible or licks the soil, it indicates indigestion, and it should have a little physics."
"In order to produce relatively strong currents, even in the event of a minimal sound force, Franz Kröttlinger of Vienna has made an interesting experiment to use thermoelectric currents for the transmission of sound at a distance. The apparatus he has built is extremely simple. A hot stream of air flowing from the bottom to the top is diverted more or less from its direction by the human voice. By its action, an adjacent thermo-battery is excited, whose current passes through the spiral of an ordinary telephone, which serves as a receiver instrument. As a source of heat, the inventor uses a common stearine candle, whose flame is held at one level and at the same means by a spring similar to those used in the transport lamps. On one side of the candle is a metal funnel fixed on a support, its mouth being covered with a sliding mobile disk, equipped with an appropriate number of small openings. On the other side, a similar medium holds a thermo-battery in the shape of a funnel."
"The container is closed by a well-fitted cork that passes through the glass tube that forms an end of the pump. The cork around the tube and up to the edge of the first one is painted with a soft cement. The tube casts 40 mm. into the mercury and passes through a small piece of watch glass sheet, W, Figure 1, which prevents the small air bubbles that crawl upwards along the tube from reaching its open end; the small cup is firmly cemented in its place. The flux of mercury is controlled by the steel rod and cylinder, CR, Figure 1. The bottom of the steel cylinder is filled with a circular piece of pure, properly cemented Indian rubber; this soon adapts to the required use and responds beautifully. The pressure of the cylinder at the end of the tube is regulated by the lever; this is attached to a circular board that is again firmly fixed on the open end of the glass."
"The water is abundant in many states and contributes greatly to their prosperity. Its development requires the services of the civil engineer, and since it is the branch of the profession that I know the most, I propose to make some remarks about it. The first applications were to scratch and sawmill; the cartage and mills to be filled soon followed; these were essential for the comfort of the first settlers who relied on the domestic industries for housing, food and clothing, but with the progress of the country came from other requirements. The first application of water energy for general manufacturing purposes seems to have been in Paterson, New Jersey, where ""the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufacturing"" was formed in 1791. The River Passaic at this point provides, when at least eleven hundred horses continuously night and day. The energy of water in Lowell, Massachusetts, began to be improved for general manufacturing purposes in 1822. The River Merrimack at this point has a drop of thirty-five hours, for at least thirty-five feet, for at least thirty-five hours, provides the usual work."
"The authors described their experiments on metal fluid density as a follow-up to those submitted to Section B at the Swansea meeting of the Association. Some time after one of the authors reported on the results of experiments to determine the density of metal silver, and of certain alloys of silver and copper when molten. The method adopted was that designed by Mr. R. Mallet, and the details were as follows: A conical container with a thinr Lowmoor plate (1 millimetre thick), about 16 centimetres high, with an inner volume of approximately 540 cubic centimetres, was weighed, first empty, and then filled with distilled water at a known temperature. The necessary data were thus given to accurately determine its capacity at air temperature."
"The thin hair, soft on the obstacle part of the slate of a cow, for the most part, turns upwards. This hair that grows upwards extends in most cases on the whole part of the slate visible between the hind legs, but is sometimes marked by spots or simple lines, usually oval thin, in which the hair grows downwards. This tendency of the hair to grow upwards is not confined to the udder proper; but extends on the thighs and upwards to the tail. The edges of this space on which the hair rises are generally clearly marked, and, as a general rule, the more the area of this space, which is called the ""miror"" or ""scutcheon"", the more milk the cow will give, and the more it will continue in the milk. This part of the scuton that covers the leudder and extends inside each thigh, has been designated as the mirror of the oudder or breast; which rises towards the top of the tail, the mirror of the tail."
"I said this to my boys, Roy and Fred, a cold night, when we were all gathered around the open fire.""No,"" said Fred, ""it's a new story. Does it tell the time when you were a little girl?"" and about the farm and living room with the big fireplace, and the bellows, and the glass of the hour more than more, and the old iron tampons in a red tray?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, ""that's about everything you like to hear so well."" Then I told the story as follows: ""My story begins in the living room long, low and pleasant of the farm, with its large beam that crosses the low ceiling. There was also a large fireplace, and a large stone fireplace. There, we children were fenestling our nuts, and there, on winter evenings, a large basket of Rhode-Island Greenings always stood warming in the corner."
"In 1831, there were a considerable number of pallet vapours running along certain rivers in England that crossed the canal to the mainland. But there were no ocean vapours, which are called well-known, and there were no vapours used for warfare purposes. As in the case of wagon boilers, the boilers of the pallet vapours of 1831 were the most inadequate to withstand pressure."
"There was no playmate for Charley at Grandpa's, but with a calf in the barn, several broods of chickens, and four kittens, he found enough to occupy his mind. He was standing very early in the morning, and he was after ten o'clock when he came into the kitchen rather hungry. ""Look under the cloth on the table, Charley, called his grandmother in the living room. You will find a little cake that I cooked for you. Don't you see it?"" she asked, coming into the kitchen. ""There, that one."" ""Oh!"" said Charley, I thought it was a bread."" Then, taking the cake in his hand, he sat on a rock at the foot of a tree a little distance from the house, and began to eat with a lot of relish. Not far from him, and a little away from the other buildings, was corn bread, and at one end of his roof, he was a house bird, which had been taken by two small birds for their house."
"Coal is an impure form of carbon derived from the progressive oxidation and destruction of plant materials by natural causes; for example, wood is first transformed into a peaty substance, then into a body called lignite, which in turn is transformed into different varieties of coal; these changes, which have led to the accumulation of vast layers of coal in the crust of the earth, have continued for years. There are many different types of coal; some are hydrogen-rich and are therefore well adapted to produce illuminating gas, while others, such as anthracite, are very carbon-rich and contain little hydrogen; the last variety of coal is smoke-free and is therefore widely used for drying malt."
"Among the older varieties of the apple, he strongly recommended Button Beauty, which had proved so excellent in Massachusetts, and which had also succeeded in the nursery of Mount Hope in Rochester; the fine growth of the tree and its high productivity being strongly in his favour. Wagener and Northern Spy are among the finer kinds. Melon is one of the best among the older kinds; the fruit being quite tender will not carry a long expedition, but it has great value for domestic use, and being a bad farmer, it has been set aside by nurseries and orchards. It should be grafted on more vigorous kinds. Jonathan is another beautiful kind of thin growth, which should be grafted to the top. Among the new pears, Hoosic and Frederic Clapp have been strongly praised for their excellence."
"Colonel Bob's firestick rose and plunged, as if he were eager to crash on the enemy. The drum roll made a frightening sound. The banner holder waved his flag. The army came to rush. Snap the dog barked furiously. But above all the dinner was heard Colonel Bob's cry, ""Forward, my brave boy!"" Not a picture started from his frame. Not a chair moved. But suddenly the door opened, and a face looked inside. It was Colonel Bob's dad. ""What's all that noise, Robert?"" he said. This is not the place for such games. Exiting doors if you want to play soldier. I can't have such a drum and scream in the house."""
"Since the gelatin emulsion came into service one of the biggest problems in its manufacture was that of washing. According to the first methods, the time taken for this part of the process was, I believe, about twenty-four hours. It was very reduced and the ease of manufacture greatly facilitated by the methods now most commonly used, and which were, I believe, first communicated by Mr. Wratten and Mr. Wainright. I am talking about those of rushing with alcohol and forcing the emulsion, when it is put, through canvas, in order to divide it very finely. When this last method is used at a relatively short time is sufficient to wash it. This method, although a great improvement on the older ones, leaves much to be desired, especially for those who are not accustomed to do the emulsion regularly, but only a casual lot."
"In a good soil and a partially shaded spot, we do not have a more beautiful plant in flowers than the large grove (Cimicifuga racemosa); a bouquet of shimmering leaves pop up a dozen landscapes of racems, creamy white, and six feet high. The scarlet lychnis and its many varieties have almost passed, but the large flowers, Haag, and others of this section, are in their prime and visionary plants, they are. They are true and durable perennial, bloom well the first season from seeds, fairly rustic, copious, and effective; any ordinary garden soil."
"The copper itself of such a conductor was melted by the powerful current he carried. In the telephone central offices, Mr. Bede saw all the signals of a row of telephone wires fall at the same time, proving that an electric discharge had fallen on the wires, and that they had been transmitted to the earth. This fact shows that the wires, even without points, are capable of attracting atmospheric electricity; but it must be remembered that there are two points at each joint in the wire. Mr. Bede strongly insists on the inutility of lightning conductors by finishing in the wells, or even larger pieces of water. Mr. Becquerel and Mr. Pouillet's experiments have shown that the resistance of water to the passage of electricity is a thousand million times greater than that of iron; therefore, if the current transmitted by a wire one mm squared thickness was to be carried away by water without increased resistance, a surface of contact between the wire and water of at least 1000 square meters must be established."
"Our plaque illustrates the residence of Mr. J. E. Boehm, A.R.A., the sculptor. Bent's Brook is located in Holmwood, not far south of Dorking, on the Mid-Soussex line, and commands some beautiful views of the country well wooded. The site itself is relatively low, and the ground being clayy, it was advisable to keep the building well off the ground, and in this way a rather unusually high elevation for such a house was obtained. The plan is very compact, with an ingenious approach to the well centered room and staircase, on which, by a mezzanine contrivance, a good store is secured. The drawing room has a bay of gazebo, reached from the garden by an outside staircase, under which is a covered garden seat. A balcony overlooking the garden also leads from the living room, and a billiard room is arranged at the level of the basement with a separate entrance from the porch."
"The authors give two different processes for the determination of animal or vegetable oils or fats and of hydrocarbons or other neutral oils. They take a certain weight of the sample and boil it with twice its weight of a caustic soda solution in alcohol. Soda combines with the fatty acids of animal or vegetable oils forming soaps; soda bicarbonate is then added to neutralize the excess caustic soda; and, finally, the sand; and the whole is evaporated at the dry temperature of boiling water. The dry mixture is then transferred into a large tube of glass, having a small hole in the clogged bottom with glass wool to act as a filter, and light petroleum gasoline---which boils at about 150° to 180° Fhr.---- is poured on it, until all neutral or non-saponifiable oil is dissolved."
"One of the most important indications for the use of drugs threatens the paralysis of the heart with insufficient compensation. In such cases, it is necessary to save time until digitalis and alcoholics can deploy their action, and here amyl nitrite stands preeminent. Only one case in point will suffice to illustrate this. The patient suffered from mitral insufficiency, with irregular pulse, loss of appetite, enlargement of the liver, and light jaundice. Temporary relief had been provided several times by infusion of digitalis. In February 1879, the patient's condition suddenly worsened. The pulse became very irregular and intermittent. The state described as delirium cordis appeared, with epigastric pulsation and vomiting. Vigorous counter-irritation, with hot bottles and sinapisms at the ends, etc., proved useless. Digitalis and champagne, when administered, were immediately vomited. The pulse increased by seventy until it could no longer be counted on the wrist, while the heart beats increased to twenty minutes."
"The Mill House--This consists of a central room, 262 feet long, 98 feet wide, 68 feet high, with two appendices of 16 feet lean, which makes the total width 100 feet. The structure is entirely metal, and is arranged in such a way as to allow to take advantage of each foot of undercover space. For this reason, the construction system without connecting beams, known as the ""Dion type"", has been adopted. The binding-arrels are composed of four angled irons connected by cross bars of flat iron. The corrugated galvanized iron coating rests directly on the binding-arrels, whose upper parts are covered with wood for fastening the corrugated metal. The spacing of these rafts is calculated according to the length of the corrugated iron sheets, thus dissipating with the use of ordinary rafts, and making a roof that is both very light and very durable, and therefore very economical."
"The length of the city of Rome, relative to the width, ensures long and easy lines for the required high speed; and the depth of the hold is only 37 feet, compared to the 52-foot beam, ensures great stability and the resulting comfort of the passengers. One point calling for a special opinion is the large number of separate compartments formed by watertight bulkheads, each extending to the main deck. The largest of these compartments is only about 60 feet long; and assuming that, by collision or other cause, one of them was filled with water, the vessel's trim would not be physically affected. In order to give even greater safety in the event of a collision or swim, the boilers are arranged in two boilers, completely separated from one another by a watertight iron bulkhead."
"The object of this new machine, which has done its wonderful work for only a few days, is to artificially reproduce the caterpillar embroidered on light fabrics, cutting mechanically and sticking small circles of velvet on these fabrics. For this, all kinds of velvet can be used, and, to facilitate the cutting, they are pre-coated on the opposite side of any glue or gum, which gives the velvet a stiffness favorable to the action of the punch. To realize the desired object, the apparatus has three successive operations to perform: first, cut the circles; second, humidify; and third, fix the points on the fabric in a defined order and spacing. The machine can be built on any scale, although at present it is only done to operate on 31 inches wide pieces, which is the normal width of the points of pointing."
"The Japanese chronicles claim that the first pottery was made in the year 660 B.C.; it was only in the Christian era that considerable progress was made in the art. In 1223 B.C., great improvements were made in the manufacture and decoration of the dishes. From this date to the sixteenth century the great pottery of Owari, Hizen, Mino, Kioto, Kaga and Satsuma were established. The Rahn-Yaki, or the crepitated dishes, was made for the first time in Kioto, in the early sixteenth century. The best old Hizen dishes, which is still most admired, was made in Arita Hizen, in 1580-1585; the former Satsuma dates from 1592. Consul General Van Buren states that porcelain clays are found in almost all regions of the country, and the various kinds are generally found nearby, and near the canals and rivers, which is of considerable advantage, as a means of transport."
"From the location of this building, magnificent views are obtained on the island-pointed sea and the continent of Asia Minor: but, ""although all perspectives please"", it is an earth of earthquakes, and unfortunately, the work at the castle has been suspended, because of the terrible calamity that has recently fallen on the neighborhood. The building is intended for the residence of an English lady of high rank. It must be built of local white stone, the hall, staircase, etc., being bordered and paved with marble. The hall is a large apartment of about 25 feet high, with walled ceiling, having galleries on two sides, giving access to the rooms surrounding it on the first floor, and to the tower staircase leading to the roofs, etc. With the exception of sanitary appliances, painted windows, etc. (which will be provided by English companies), all the work will be carried out by indigenous workers. The architect is Mr. Edwin T. Hall, London."
"No one currently knows what electricity is; but for our present purpose, we can consider it as a fluid, non-elastic, and weightless, and universally diffused throughout the universe. To judge by recent published statements, a large part of the reading public is taught that this fluid is a source of energy, and that it can be done to do the work of coal. It is an illusion. As long as electricity remains in what we can call a normal state of rest, it is inert. Before we can get any work of electricity a little more work must be done on it. If this fundamental truth and the most important being kept in sight it will not be easy to make a serious mistake in estimating the value of one of the many systems to make the electricity that will be carried long before the public."
"At the recent Medical Congress in London, Professor Klebs undertook to answer the question: ""Is there any specific organized causes of the disease?"" A brief historical examination of humanity's various opinions on the origin of the disease led, the speaker thought, to the presumption that these causes were specific and organized. If we now consider the current state of this question, the following three points of view are presented as those whose subject may be considered: I.-- We must ask ourselves whether the lower organisms, which are in the sick body, can appear spontaneously; or whether they can even be considered as regular constituents of the body. II.--The morphological relations of these organisms must be studied, and their specific nature in the various morbid processes must be determined. III.-- We must inquire about their biological relations, their development inside and outside the body, and the conditions under which they may enter the body, and there to establish a disease."
"The real social peril, hardly discovered before we know how to conjure it, lies in the legions of animals or microbes that surround us and in the midst of which we live. Mr. Pasteur has revealed them to us as the factors of infectious diseases. Claude Bernard has demonstrated the community that exists between animals and vegetables--phenomene of movement, sensitivity, heat production, breathing, digestion even, because there is the Drosera and the carnivorous plants. Iron heals chlorosis in vegetables as well as in animals, and chloroform and ether make the two insensitive. There are even more striking similarities between animals. After Baudrimont, insects are, in the presence of alcohol, chloroform and irrespirable gas, also affected as man."
"By choosing a tower an amateur can exercise more or less taste, and it can be governed somewhat by the length of his purse; it is the same with respect to the mandrels; but when it comes to choosing or making shooting tools, it must conform to the fundamental principles; it must take advantage of the experience of others as far as possible and, after all, find enough to be learned by practice. The tools of almost all the descriptions can be purchased at reasonable prices, but the practice of making its own tools cannot be too strongly recommended. It allows for the exit of many emergency situations, and when time is not too precious, a saving will be achieved. A few fine tool bars, a hammer and a small anvil are all that is necessary, with the exception of fire and water. Steel must be heated to a low red and shaped with the least possible hammers; it can then be allowed to cool slowly, when it can be deposited or crushed to give it the required shape."
"Petit Sutton was an old house, parts of which were in existence before Cromwell's time. It is located in an old picturesque garden, surrounded by ivy walls and fine trees, one of the cedars being extraordinarily large and perfect, its huge branches covering a space of more than 90 feet in diameter. The greater part of the old house, being uninhabitable by decomposition, was pulled down; the old parts are shown in black on the plane, and the new hatch. It is confronted with red bricks, and red Corsehill stone dressings, and covered with tiles. The plan was arranged in such a way as to preserve the old kitchen, billiard room, morning room, and conservatory. The hall, entered from a veranda in relation to the entrance porch, is surrounded by a dado, the height of the doors; the lower panels are filled with tiles made at the design by the School of Art in Bombay. The wood is painted a soft blue color, harmonising with the general tone of the tiles, the general tone of the tiles."
"In his remarks on the synopsis of one hundred and eleven experiments, made in Washington, D.C., he said: ""As one can notice, thirty-five of them would give zero. If we take the average of the one hundred and eleven experiments, we find a yield of 4.5 percent, which cannot be accepted practically. In other words, our government, despite the favourable conditions under which they were made, will prove that the use of sorghum is misleading in all senses of the word.""... ""If sorghum is to be grown for its sirup, or for fodder, it will obviously do an excellent service."" It seems that less than four percent. of crystallisable sugar in sorghum juice will not pay the cost of making sugar, because it will not crystallize in a reasonable time, because of the glucose in the juice, which, along with the other impurities, will prevent the ready crystallization of four or five times their own weight of sucrose."
"Now, it had happened three years before, that a poor young man named Simpson had been rescued from drowning by Amy's father. I fear that the young man had thrown himself into the water because he was sick of life, but I dare say that he was quite happy to have gone out. Mr. Cooper took him home, gave him a room and a bed, and there Mr. Simpson stayed for a while. He was what is called an artist. He had a great talent to draw with a pen and ink. He taught Amy to do so. She soon did so well, that he told him: ""Continue trying, my dear, and this can be a great help to you by and by."""
"It was enough for Carlo, as we called it. He had found a good master, and my father a faithful friend. Of course, it would not do to keep the dog without trying to find his owner: so the next day it was announced; and for several days after, each ring at the bell would make us start the children, and would feel afraid that someone had come to take him. But no one came for him; and loved and robbed us our new treasure to the neglect of wooden horses and dolls, and all our other toys. Sometimes he came to the living room door with his very wet and muddy feet to run through the street gutters."
"Until that time, I had believed that the only effect of rapid inhalation was the simple deviation of the will, and that was the only way that nature could exercise itself so violently - that of controlling the involuntary action of the lungs to its uses by the safety valve, or the voluntary movement. The patient's constant breathing for 30 seconds at a minute left him in a condition of body and mind resembling the effects of ether and chloroform in their primary phases. I could only argue that prolonged breathing had done so each time; and, if so, there must be a specific effect beyond mere diversion by the will. What could be the reason for this? To the air alone, who went in excess in the lungs within a minute! Why did I not immediately grasp the idea of his wider application as it is now claimed for her? It was too, gentlemen, for that hour."
"He was only twenty years old, his brother Ivan was in his twenty-fourth year at the time, while their older brother Dmitri was twenty-seven years old. First, I have to explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion, was not even a mystic. I could as well give my full opinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted monastic life was simply because at that time he struck him, so to speak, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling with the darkness of worldly wickedness in the light of love. And the reason why this life struck him in this way was that he found there at that time, as he thought, an extraordinary being, our famous elder, Zossima, to whom he attached himself with all the first warm love of his burning heart."
"So Aunt Patience gave her chef a vigorous handkerchief, and went in her own way – the good old soul – even then considering how she should better prepare a real surprise for her young master in the form of daily feasts for a dozen guests. I'm not going to stop here to detail the character of this preparation or to linger on her success. It's enough to say that Tom Tunison praised Aunt Patience to heaven; and, as if that wasn't enough to make her happy, he produced a large clay pipe, three plugs of true ""manufac terbacker"", which was difficult to get in those times, a red shawl, and twelve yards of calico. The fifteen that followed Tom's guests' arrival was a long time to remember, not only in the annals of the Rockville Hunting Club, but in the annals of Rockville itself."
"She said goodbye to Heidi and to ""Goodbye"" to the uncle, and began to go down the mountain. As the steam of her excitement seemed to push her forward, and she ran at a huge pace. The people of the village now called her more than they had done when they went up, because they were all wondering where she had left the child. They knew both well and knew their story. When she heard from the door and windows: ""Where is the child?"" ""Where did you leave her, Deta?"" and so on, she replied more and more reluctantly: ""With the Alm-Uncle,—with the Alm-Uncle!"" She was very angry because the women called her from all sides: ""How can you do it?"" ""The poor little creature!"" ""The idea of leaving a child up there without help!"" and again and again: ""The poor little dear girl!"" Deta ran as fast as she could and was happy when she heard no more calls, because she was worried, because, for no reason, she said, ""The poor little dear girl was running as quickly as she could and was happy when she heard no more calls, because, because, for no reason."
"He was six years old, had red cheeks and blue eyes, and hair so curly that he was still in a buzz, no matter how brushed he was. One summer, his mother took him to the country to spend a few weeks on a farm. The farmer's wife, Mrs Hill, was very happy to see him coming, because she had no daughters or boys to make the house pleasant. She liked to see Willie running, and to hear her voice call after the great house dog Bruno. One morning Willie had been as busy as ever in his room: he had been in the orchard, hunting for ripe apples; he had been in the barn, looking for chicken eggs in the sweet hay; he had come down to the stream, sailing his boat; and he had played as a merchant, with Bruno harassed for a horse."
"Our Ned is a brave little boy of about eight years old. He is full of fun, and likes to play out of doors in all sorts of times. But what a little boy can be happy when he has a mad toothache! Ned has worn like a hero; but he had to give up at last, and he was happy to take refuge in his mother's knees, and be a baby again for a while. With his head pillow on his mother's chest, the little boy found some relief; but he was still in great pain. His sister was there, trying to think of some way to help him. Ned could not help herself cry; but he said to his mother, ""I want you to tell me a story."" ""What will there be, darling?"" said his mother. ""Tell me about Harry and his dog Jack."" This story had been told to Ned when he was very, very little boy, and many times since."
"Now, when a person leaves to discuss the relationship between electricity and light, it is very natural and very appropriate to do so short with the following two questions: ""What do you mean by electricity?"" and ""What do you mean by light?"" These two questions that I intend to try to answer briefly. And then, let me observe that by answering these fundamental questions, I do not necessarily assume a fundamental ignorance on your part of these two agents, but rather the contrary; and I beg you to remember that if I repeat well-known and simple experiences before you, it is with the aim of drawing attention to their true meaning and meaning, and not to their obvious and superficial characteristics; in the same way that I could repeat the extremely familiar experience of throwing a stone on the earth if we were to define what we mean by gravitation."
"The foundation of success in life is good health. It is the fortune of the substrate; it is also the basis of happiness. A person cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick. He has no ambition; no incentive; no strength. Of course, there are those who have poor health and cannot help him: one cannot expect that these people can accumulate wealth, but there are many in poor health that do not need it. If, then, healthy health is the foundation of success and happiness in life, how important it is that we study the laws of health, which is only another expression for the laws of nature! The more we keep the laws of nature, the closer we are to good health, and yet how many people there are not attention to natural laws, but absolutely transgress them, even against their own natural inclination."
"While I write this, seven little boys and nine little girls (how much does it all do?) are busy writing on their slates. These children have no books to study. I tell them what I want to teach them, and they write it, and try to remember it. But I teach them without saying a word. I speak with their fingers. You have already guessed, I dare say, that these dear little children are deaf and mute; that is, they cannot hear or speak. They cannot go to school and live at home, and see dad and mom night and morning, as you can; for there are no schools for them near them. They must go away from home, and stay in school for long weeks without seeing father or mother, brother or sister."
"The ants, therefore, mount trees on the leaves of which the aphids have picked up. Then an ant approaches one of these insects for a drop of sweet juice. If it will not soon be given, the ant will gently tap the aphid's body, and thus obtain a supply of mild fluid. After feasting on it, the ant will pass to another small aphid and treat it in the same way for another drop. But the ant has enough meaning to treat the aphid as we treat our cows. Our farmers, you know, keep the cows in the closed meadows, and reserve hay and turnips to them when the grass fails. The ants also take a number of aphids near their nests, and there keep them safe and provide them with appropriate food. Now the coccillies also love the aphids, and eat them hundreds."
"""Why do flowers always grow so well for Mary? I often plant seeds, but nothing comes from them. They will not grow for me. But the flowers seem to spring out wherever she goes. They must have a special taste for her."" That's what Tom once said, as he saw Mary water the flowers. Well, it's not surprising, Tom, if the flowers have a taste for such a lovely little girl. There's nothing very strange about that. How could they help to love her? But, after all, maybe the secret of the question is, that Mary loves the flowers, and never forgets to take care of them. She takes care of them every day, and not by adjustments and starts, as some do. So she has good luck with her flowers and is always able to make a beautiful bouquet. And she does not only take advantage of the flowers herself but, which is even better, she takes pleasure in having them with her."
"Colonel Higginson's lecture was for me a green oasis in the arid desert of metaphysics, but it was considered by the fervent researchers of truth in the class as completely irrelevant for the purpose of the course. The speaker himself gave me at the end of the session a suspicion that his audience was more concerned with philosophy than with literature. Once or twice Mr. Emerson went to school, not taking part in his work, but sitting patiently on time, and bearing what a journalist described as his ""sage memory."" After the conference for the session, the topic was thrown into discussion and there was an opportunity to ask questions. Most of us were shy to express ourselves in this presence, feeling in a state of instruction. Usually, there was a silence of several minutes, as at a Quaker meeting waiting for the spirit of movement; then Mr. Alcott announced in his solemn musical tonalities ""I have a thought""; and after an important pause he spoke of Orphic."
"From Caesar, it can be said that he came into the world at a special moment and for a special object. The ancient religions were dead, from the Pillars of Hercules to the Euphrates and the Nile, and the principles on which human society had been built were also dead. There remained of spiritual conviction only the common and human sense of justice and morality; and in this sense an orderly system of government had to be built, under which quiet men could live, work, and eat the fruits of their industry. Under a rule of this kind, there can be no enthusiasm, no chivalry, no holy aspirations, no heroic patriotism."
"The young Gill, son of the great master, Milton's school Fellow, went up to Trinity, Oxford, where he was in trouble by being informed by Chillingworth, who brought in incaudible political speeches from Gill to his godfather, Laud. With Gill, Milton corresponded; they exchanged their verses, Greek, Latin and English, with a confession from Milton that he preferred the English and Latin composition to Greek; this to write Greek verses at this age is to sing to the deaf. Gill, Milton found ""a severe critique of poetry, though willing to be gracious to his friend's attempts."" If Milton's genius did not speak in his paraphrases of Psalms, he did so in his impetuousness to learn, ""that I grasped so eagerly that from the twelfth year of my age, I never went to bed before midnight."""
"In every part of the earth, man's first struggle was for his daily food. With only a rough instrument of stone or bone, he had to get fish from the sea, from the bird of the air, from the beast of the forest. For centuries, with such bad equipment, he had to rip out a precarious livelihood from nature. He also saw any form of life around him trying to satisfy his hunger. There seemed to be a spirit of hunger abroad. At the same time, there was such resistance to the satisfaction of man of his needs — the bird and the fish so hard to get, the prickly earth so ready to give him a stone when he asked for bread — that it came to the conclusion that there must be invisible voracious beings who want all the good things for themselves."
"During the years spent in Europe writing his first story, from 1851 to 1856, Mr. Motley had lived a life of great retreat and simplicity, devoted to his work and to the education of his children, to which he was always ready to give the most careful supervision. He was still unknown beyond the circle of his friends, and he was not looking for society. In this quiet way, he had spent the two years of residence in Dresden, the year divided between Brussels and The Hague, and a very quiet year spent in Vevay on Lake Geneva. His health at that time was tolerably good, except for nervous headaches, which often recursed and were of great gravity. His visit to England with his manuscript in search of an editor was already mentioned. In 1858, he revisited England. His reputation as an author was there before him, and he naturally became the subject of many attentions."
"Mr. Charles Darwin and his disciples deny design as having an appreciable part in the formation of the organism at all. Paley and the theologians insist on design, but on a designer outside the universe and the body. The third opinion is that suggested in the first case, and carried out at a very high degree of development by Buffon. It was improved, and indeed made almost perfect by Dr. Erasmus Darwin, but too neglected by him after he introduced it. It was borrowed, as I think we can say with some confidence, from Dr. Darwin by Lamarck, and was followed by him ardently from there, for the rest of his life, although somewhat less perfectly understood by him than by Dr. Darwin. It is that the design that designed the organisms, resided in, and was embodied in the organizations themselves."
"Mrs. S. had a new cook; and one day she put a saucepan of cream on the back porch to refresh herself. When she went out to get it, an hour or two later, she found nothing but the empty saucepan. Molly ran to Mrs. S. in great distress, and told her of the loss of cream. ""Ah!"" said Ms. S., ""then Daisy ate it."" And, of course, Daisy was the thief. Another time, the naughty girl put her head in the kitchen window, and ate apple pies that were on the table. All this was very bad indeed, but Daisy was always forgiven because she was so nice and sweet. She followed any family about the field, and rubbed her head against them to show how much she loved them. One day a man came to Mr. S.'s house to make a visit. He was not used to visiting the family, and so did not meet Daisy."
"George is never happier than when he's on Grandfather's knee; and the first thing Grandpa has to do, when little George is sitting there, is to take out his watch. ""Look, look!"" shouts little George; and Grandpa opens it, and lets him see all the little wheels and brilliant works, which shine and shine so, and continue the rapid movements, and make him say to the watch, ""Cic, cic!"" Grandpa and George are good friends, because Grandpa is trying to explain things to him. One day he brought back a watch and gave it to the little boy for himself, and showed him how to raise it up, and to tick it. George is very proud of it, and will soon learn to say the time of the day. He now knows how to count ten."
"The reader may think that the collections made by the dustman are worthless, but this is not the case. There are more than 300,000 inhabited houses in London, consuming more than 3,500,000 tons of coal per year, and in addition to the ashes of this large quantity of fuel, the dustman gathers the other waste from the houses. He is employed by an entrepreneur, who agrees with the company to remove the ashes, etc., from the city, and the contractor divides each load into six parts, as follows: soil, or fine dust, which is sold to brick manufacturers for manure and farmers; brishes, or cinders, sold to brick manufacturers for combustion; rags, bones and old metals, sold to seamen's shops; old iron and tin ships, sold to trunk manufacturers for claws; bricks, oysters and other shells, sold to foundations and to road construction; and old boots and shoes, sold to Prussian blue manufacturers."
"The one we have illustrated is a good example, but despite its poor appearance, its torn sleeves and its useless boots, it is not at all disgusting. His face tells the need and the pain; he threw an old basket on his shoulders, in which he carries his load, and, with a pile in his hand, he saunters along the street, proclaiming his profession, ""Grun-salt, grun-salt, grun-salt!"" Besides the soil and the snow grass, he has small pieces of grass for sale, whose larks are very expensive. Birds in their cages with open windows dog and put their pretty little heads aside when they hear it come; they know perfectly who it is and what it brings, and their twitter is formed in a greeting. The old raven perched on the edge of the basket feels like a superior being and wonders why other birds do such a rest on a little green things, but it is only because he has more coarse tastes."
"But everything was useless: the sleeping eyes were wide open, as if they wanted to remain open in spite of all of us. But when aunte noticed that she was going to her room to sharpen her pencil, and draw some pictures of a cat, or a dog, or a rabbit, Edith's eyes were shining; and she said, ""Let me go too?"" So Edith sat on her aunt's knees, and asked her to draw a rabbit, — a ""jabbit,"" Edith called her, and to begin with her ears. ""Yes, little animal. Here are her ears, and here is her body, and here is her tail, and here are her feet, and here are some glasses for him to see through,"" said aunt, drawing every item as she called her. ""And here are some pretty red pearls around her neck, and some rings."
"I then visited the chapel of Islip, built by the former abbot of Islip, who consecrated him to Saint John the Baptist. A very interesting monument was in the memory of General Wolfe, who fell, you remember, at the Battle of Quebec. His monument is a beautiful piece of art. He depicts him falling in the arms of one of his own soldiers, who points to Glory, who comes in the form of an angel of the clouds, holding a crown with which to crown the hero. A sergeant of the Highlands looks sadly at the dying warrior, while two lions sleep at his feet. The inscription reads as follows: ""In memory of James Wolfe, Major-General and Commander-in-Chief of the British Land Forces during an expedition against Quebec, who, having overcome, by ability and value, all the obstacles of art and nature, was destroyed at the time of victory, on September 13, 1759, the king and the parliament of Great Britain dedicated this monument."""
"Sixty years ago, when grandfather was a little boy, he had a dog called Romeo, which was made to do the work of butter. I never saw a churn that went by the dog's power; but it had to be a awkward affair. The task could not have been pleasant, and I don't wonder that Romeo didn't like it. One morning, when the churn was out, and the cream was ready to be made in butter, there was no Romeo to find. Long and noisy were the calls made for him; but he didn't answer his name. The churning was done that day without his help. Nothing was seen from him until just before the night, when he entered the house with the air of a prodigal son. He didn't walk like an honest dog to get his dinner, but sank under a table."
"""I think Pansy has nothing to say,"" said his mother. ""It's not that,"" said Pansy. ""It's an important secret: a secret my mother will like to hear."" ""Oh, it's important,"" said Dad?"" ""I wonder what it can be."" ""Mother, what day did you lose your wedding ring?"" said John. ""Don't talk about that, John. It was over a month ago. I chased up and down, and I can't find it. I would have given all my other jewels rather than losing it."" Here Pansy turned red to his face, came down from his high chair, and ran out of the room."
"She looked for them all about the menagerie, and asked all the animals if they had seen her two pretty yellow-striped lions. No one had seen them, and almost everyone was sorry, and had something nice to say, because Juno was a favorite with a lot. To be sure, the wolf attacked her, and he told her that she was right to think that she, a miserable baited dog, could raise young lions. But Juno knew that she had only done what she had been told, so she didn't worry about the wolf. The monkeys broke jokes, and teased her, saying that they were guessing that they would give her another family to look after the sea lions, probably, and that she had to live in the water to keep them in order."
"In some schools, where such a plan was adopted, the boys were inclined to consider it a great boredom, and feared the return of the so-called social evening, when they should be, for a few hours, in a state of nervous anxiety, for fear that they would be catechized in a corner, or betrayed in something they would be sorry for afterwards. But, with one exception, this was not the case with the Blackrock boys; the reception on Tuesday was always a day of red letters with them, and if ever, by bad behavior, an invitation was refused, it was considered one of the most severe punishments inflicted on the school."
"As for the potatoes, they were so small, and the corn was so short in the ear, that the earth only knew where the money came from to provide them with all that needed to be worn. Not that she took care of the dress, for she had not worn the same hood and shawl in the church until she was ashamed to show her face there? As for the sewing company, she was a master hand to cut and plan, and she could go as well as not, now that Debby was old enough to take care of the baby, and prepare the supper for her father and the boys; but not a step would sit next to Mrs. Williams with her black silk, and Mrs. White with her beautiful alpaca, although their husband's farms were not bigger than those of Mr. Blanchard; and for her life, she could not understand why she should not dress as well when she worked twice as hard as they were."
"The beautiful pine that listened to the whisper of the south wind and swept into the cold of the north explosion was so divided that we could take it slowly and lightly turn it between two fingers. But what it lost in size that it gained in use. The small flame that it carries, and which looks so harmless, flashing in short existence, has a latent power more terrible than the whirlwind that may have sent the big pine tree crash to the ground. But the story is not yet closed. From the machine that finished the matches, they are taken to the ""boxers"" - especially the girls and the women - who place them in small boxes. The speed with which this is done is surprising. With one hand they take an empty box and remove the cover, while on the other they just grab a sufficient number of matches, and by a particular movement arrange them evenly, then—'t is done!"
"Many times, I have heard the English say, as if they really pity us: ""Your country has no monuments yet; but then it is so young — only two hundred years — and, of course, we can't expect to have any monuments or history."" Yet, we have some monuments, and a chapter or two of history, that the homeland doesn't remember too much or often. But I'm not going to write now about the Bunker Hill monument, neither the realization in New Orleans, nor the surrender of Lord Cornwallis to Yorktown. I mean another land closer to his childhood than ours, with a story barely three-quarters of a century, but with a monument, at least, that is worth seeing, and that can't be thought of without emotions of loving admiration and veneration. The memorial is bronze, and tells a story of deprivation and suffering, but of glorious heroism, and victory even in death."
"More than one hundred and sixty-eight years ago, he lived a curious character called ""Old Riddler"". His real name was unknown to people in that part of the country where he lived; but it didn't make any difference, because the name given to him was probably as good as his. Indeed, I'm quite sure it was better, because it meant something, and very few people have names that mean anything. He was called Old Riddler for two reasons. First, he was an elderly man; second, he was the greatest man to ask for riddles that you've ever heard of. So, that name was very well suited to him. Old Riddler had some very special characteristics — among others, he was a gnome."
"My dear Cousins: Will I really speak to you as I sit here in my study with the Thames flowing now, now flowing, in front of my window? I don't speak a word, I write only; and you don't listen, do not read, for long ago I think will reach you on the millions of waves that swell and flow between us. And yet I will speak to you in truth. Likewise, with divine differences, God began to speak to us centuries before our birth: I won't say until we began to be, for, in a certain sense, God began to think of us, for what God thinks we have begun to exist. We have been lying in his heart for centuries without knowing it. But now we have begun to know it. We are here, with a great beginning, and before us such a great end that there is no end. But we must beware, for otherwise, the great greatness will turn to confusion and terror."
"Annie could only wonder what a pipe would be for, but she had been taught to be patient and to wait for things to be explained to her; then she stood very quiet, and soon saw the fairy in yellow floating on the earth. Behind her came another little creature all in red, and still behind her a third in a beautiful blue dress. Between them, they wore a long pipe, like that Roger, the gardener, smoked; and when they were in front of the little girl, they began to blow through her very hard, and Annie soon found herself inside a big soap bubble, and felt that she was gently floating up in her fairy ball."
"One day, Mr. Little drew their attention to the wood that the carpenters had thrown aside like garbage, and told them that he was going to pick up some of it, and send it home to burn it; ""and now, the boys,"" said Mr. Little, ""if you want to help your mother, here's a chance to get her some firewood. You can come every day, and get everything you can carry home."" They came home delighted with the plan; and the next morning, as soon as breakfast was done, they were ready to start their work. The two older boys took their wheelbarrows, and the youngest his cart, and they started. I could see them from my window, working very diligently, and they quickly came back, each with a good load. They hit the back door, and asked me where I could put my wood. I told them they could put it in the cellar, and they opened the outside cellar for them."
"Mrs. Somerby no longer said, sure that she had awakened him from his torrid state. She put Joe up to the point of departure, just like she did her kitchen guard, and he kept his way as regularly as this old timepiece. She was just the woman to relax Joe, that her bright ways were never hurting, because he knew that his heart was full of tenderness for him. An hour later, Joe went into the yard. Mrs. Somerby flew away with a piece of sugar for a jaded horse, bought by Joe to speculate, and who ate everything he could get, including his bedding, and never grew up.""I'm going to make a trotter of him in a month, and sell it to some of the great ones!"" Joe said, but his system failed or the material was poor, old Jack slipped along as if every step was likely to be his last."
"For a long time, they continued their neck and neck, and the excitement went up to the heat of the fever. At that time, a mouse tried to cross the course, and was immediately devoured by an owl, who acted as the police of the course. Finally, the two riders reappeared towards the big stand, that is, the place where the Cassowary stood with the signal rifle or rather a pistol. The screams and shouts became more agitated and violent; there was no doubt about it, the Stork was in front of it! It was in vain that the gallant little Crane stretched all the nerves; the Stork entered the stand three good lengths before his opponent. Bang! went the gun, and the Stork had won."
"""You must lose your sight,"" said the cook, taking a spoon. ""Now I'm going to stir the eggs, and now I'm going to put on a little flour; and now I'm going to grill a little nutmeg.""""I think you better put on milk,"" said Jenny.""Of course, I will,"" replied the cook. ""Where is the milk pool?""""You will find it on the floor,"" said Jenny. ""Albert looked, and cried, ""Go, Snap!""""See, Jenny, this greedy dog put all the milk!"" ""No matter,"" said Jenny. ""You can get more where you got the eggs."" Albert therefore seized the little pitcher, he went through the movement to empty it, stirring the pudding once again, then the place on the little doll."""
"And they made tarts, and dug holes, and filled them with water for the wells; and they made mountains with caves on their sides, and all that they could think. And it came to pass, that it came to pass, that Jamie had to be far from her lopin of sand; and she said that she thought he would sleep there, if he could. And after dinner, as soon as he woke up from his nap, he went straight to his sand. Freddy was there before him; and soon Minnie Rich, an eleven-year-old girl, went out, and played with them. And she knew how to work better than any of them. And first she made him a house with holes in the sides for doors and windows, and a chip for the chimney. Then she made a smooth lawn in front of the house, and a few hills and valleys in the back, fenced in a courtyard, and put flowers."
"""You big, horrible thing! Each berry has gone now, for I will not eat them after you. And now!"" But, so far from being penitent or scared, the bear took this interference, and especially the blow, in very bad part, and after a moment of flashing astonishment, he sat on his axes, scolded a little, showed his teeth, and very clearly intimidated that, unless this bucket of berries was restored at once, there would be trouble for someone. But it was not the first bear bucket that Roxie had seen, and his temperament was raised as well as that of the bear. Thus, firmly seizing the bucket, she began to retreat, at the beginning slowly, but as the bear landed on his feet and seemed inclined to follow it, or rather the bucket of berries, she lost courage, and turned, began to run, not worrying or noting in which direction, and always mechanically grasping the bucket of berries."
"Her cage was placed on her table near her bed, and she always began the day by having a little conversation with Chirp. There was no risk of opening the cage, and letting him go out into the room; for he was flying to Helen as soon as she called her. So for years, the little bird and the little girl lived happily together. One day in November, when Helen was almost eleven years old, she had made a call, and on her return, Chirp was missing. Helen saw that a window had been left open, and knew that he had to fly away. ""Oh, honey!"" she said, in great distress, ""my poor little Chirp left, and I will not see him again."" Her mother tried to comfort her by saying that he had not gone long, and could not be far away. ""But,"" said Helen, ""it's cold, and it's snowing, too, and it must be refrigerated to death."""
"The ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is a real ghost story. It is not very surprising, but very, very funny, when you know that poor Ichabod Crane scared during his midnight turn that last time he went to court the unique daughter of Governor Wouter Van Twiller. You have to read for yourself the famous story of Rip Van Winkle and the nap he took. It is too long for me to give in the words of Irving, and ""Rip Van Winkle"" is just such a story as no one, but Irving knows how to tell. In another of his interesting stories in the ""Sketch Book"", he says, by an old strange traveller to such a strange company gathered in a large inn-kit, Irving describes the busy time to prepare a wedding. The father of the bride, he says, ""had nothing exactly to do."""
"Bentleyville and Bentley were connected by a line of houses that made it difficult to say where the village ended up and the city started. Ambitious young villagers took advantage of this to talk about ""we city dwellers"", while the older ones talked about themselves as ""the people of the countryside."" Nannie didn't care at least what she was, and she didn't care much about walking, although the feet that had raced so much started to get tired. If only she could carry a peace offering to Aunt Samantha! That would do straight, and her bright little world again, she was sure. ""I can't have candy or slate pencils forever; but I don't care, because I love her, and she will know it — of course, if I buy her a handkerchief, and she told me that I've all made mussolés,"" she said."
"A board strip, a half-inch thick, five inches wide and twenty-two inches long, has notches cut on one side, two inches wide at the bottom, and collapses as shown. Short pieces of board nailed on each end keep the strip standing. Then, it is placed on the floor less than two feet from the wall. Each player is provided with the same number of marbles (three to five, or as much as the players wish), and on the other side of the coin, he rolls to the board, the object being to roll through the arches, which have numbers immediately above them in the way shown. The one who counts most after rolling all the marbles is entitled to a single game. Or, if you have only five or six marbles, each part rolls the whole number by itself, and should have a tie between those who make the largest aggregate number, they must roll again, the one who then has the largest number winning the game."
"There is here a great park, known as Maidan, where dogs run with bones to pick; and this habit of dogs is perfectly suited to crows, for they always try to escape from the bones, and often also succeed. This is the way they usually go to work. The first crow who sees a dog with a bone calls all his friends, and they fly to the place where the dog is located. There, they light up and stand around him. Then they talk to each other. Perhaps one said, in crow's tongue, ""It's a bad heart;"" another said, ""He has twisted legs;"" another, ""His tail is cut;"" and therefore they continue to talk until the dog gets angry, and with a blow and bark, tries to hunt them. It only makes them laugh; and they start to torment the dog by talking, and even jumping on his back, and pulling his tail."
"Now, that there was nothing to say, Mabel could not think of anything else. She climbed on her knee, and sat down so silent, that her dad said, ""Well, pus, do you have nothing to say to Dad for the night?"" ""Oh, I don't have to tell you my secrets, Dad,"" said the wise little Mabel: ""I have them a lot, and one is for you; and if I say, you will know everything about it."" Now that the ice was broken, Mabel chatted, innocently thinking that his secrets were safe in her little wise head. ""Mamma knows,"" she continued; but you must not know; and we are going to have a Christmas tree to put them on, and everyone will be so surprised."""
"""Tell us a story, Kate,"" said Emma. ""Yes, do,"" cried Bertha. ""Do you want to tell us a story?"" said Herbert. Thus, mistreated by these dear, good children, I could not refuse. So, while their three heads, close together, with their bright faces shining on me and on the other, formed a beautiful image, I told them this story of two shepherd dogs, Bravo and Rory:—When farmer John and his bride moved into their small white house, one kilometer from the old house, they took with them the young dog Bravo, and left Rory to keep the old house. Bravo was great and great awake, but he was only five months old. He seemed very happy in his new house. His master taught him many curious things; and for a week or more, he showed no sign of harm at home."
"One of them, the mother, of course, approached more and more small circles, at the same time as he called his baby by encouraging the little chiropters. Birdie on her pole seemed very excited, turning her head from one side to the other in the most cunning way. But when her mother approached him, only to dart him and call him to follow him, he seemed so disappointed that I really felt like I had to comfort him. The mother came back very quickly and resumed her flight lesson, and the very hard work she found too, because the little boy was shy and refused to follow her, despite all his coaxises and rumblings. After having worked a long time, she flew away, letting her baby tremble on her pole."
"The ground was covered with snow, and now it had begun to rain. There was no prospect of change in time, which made Fred's face rather dark as he looked out of the window. Harry was turning the leaves of a history book. You could see that they were both disappointed that the morning was stormy; for when they arrived at grandfather in winter, they were waiting for bright days and a lot of fun.""What should we do?"" said Fred. ""Let's go into the garland!"" cried Harry. ""This plan obviously suited them both, because they were rushing towards the door; and the dog, waking up from his nap, entered into the idea, too. At this moment, Aunt Carrie entered the room."
"So, the next day, the sugar came out, she bought two dollars from Teddy was at school, and without even telling her mother, she searched the house to find a hiding place. She shook her head at the pantry and in the cellar, but she visited the garland, and the emergency front room; she looked into the camphor-chier, she looked at a barrel of potatoes, she moved on things in her pantry, and finally, she hid the sugar! No danger of Teddy finding it this time! Aunt Ann could not repress a triumph smile while sitting at her knitting."
"On a number of hills there were old solemn owls, trying to look very wise. Most of these owls sat perfectly as we were rolling; but I saw two or three fly slowly, as if they were half asleep. I wonder if these old sober birds teach the little prairie dogs all their wisdom. All the meadows of this part of Kansas are covered with a short and thick grass, called ""buffalo-grass"", and the dogs live on its roots. These roots are small bulbs, and make good food rich for the funny little guys. A gentleman who has been living here for many years tells me that all their houses are connected underground by halls or passages, so that they can travel a mile or so without coming to the top of the ground. Wherever you see a village of prairie dogs, you will find water digging a few feet."
"He understands fishing much better than most boys, for he rarely misses his game. He takes a stand on the ramp, stares at the finny tribes below, and when a fish that suits him comes into his range, he plunges into the water and brings it with his strong beak, then beats him on the ramp to make him lame and tender before swallowing. It is not so surprising that he is such an expert fisherman, for during the winter it is his only occupation; he has no family to take care of now, and he is so selfish and quarrely that he will not allow any of his brothers to fish near him. He considers the length of the wharf his fishing station, and his brothers must not attack his land; if they do so, he hunts them with a squeaking noise, enough to scare any fisher not stronger than himself."
"When I look at images of people from the past, I often think it's a curious thing that the only apparent difference between them and the people of today is to be seen in their clothes. If we could take a dozen ancient Greeks and Romans; some gentlemen and ladies of the Middle Ages; a party of our great-grandfathers and mothers, and some nice people who now live on the next street, and had to dress all women in calico pants and suncaps, and all men in linen coats and wide trousers and straw hats, with their short cut hair; and then had to buzz them all together, and keep them quiet, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for a committee, without knowledge of either party, to choose the elders, the middle-aged, or the modern."
"Then he smiled (of course it wasn't very beautiful, because he was in a hurry, but it was the best he could do), and looked straight into the eyes of the cow. She saw this smile, and he touched it so much that it stopped a little. Then she turned around a little, but the thought of this aggravating fly, and this horrible frog, was too much for her poor nerves, and turned wildly. In another minute, the poor old man – cane, small legs, smile and all – rose up in the air. He turned it on into the top of a hickory-tree. One branch grinned his eye, two ran in his legs, while another held his stiff and straight smile. So he remained until an eagle saw the way, threw and flew with him to his nest, which was on a huge rock that rose directly in the cold air and made the top of a mountain."
"I have known several cases where treasures lost by piracy or shipwreck were recovered after a century or more. A few years ago, a company of Boston men made two cruises to the benches of the silver key on the benches of Bahama, a place noted for the shipwrecks. They had a clue to a ship loaded with treasures that had failed a long time ago. The first voyage was unsuccessful, but on the second voyage the wreck was found. Various, armed with modern aircraft, spent several days in the quest, but in vain, until, finally, just as the last diver was about to give the signal to be set up, he leaned against what seemed only the inlaid end of a barnacle of a beam; but suddenly he gave up the place, and numbers of doublons of gold rolled at his feet."
"As with consciousness and volition, so with sudden ignorance. It impresses us more and more deeply, the more it is not, until it reaches a point of impression so impressive that we cannot make more impression at all, on which we die then and there. For death kills only by ignorance, that is, because the new position, whatever it is, is so wide that it is a cross compared to the old one, that we cannot merge the two to understand the combination; hence the loss of all recognition and faith in ourselves and in our environment. But, even if we remember about the details of any remarkable impression that has been made to us by one blow, we do not remember as much as we think."
"Crip was eleven years old, it was his birthday, and Crip was in shame, in a garland. Was it not terrible? It was so: Crip's father was a shoemaker. The bench where he worked and the little end of a shop, about eight feet on each side, in which he worked, was standing on a street leading to the quay of the city, and the name of the city we will say was Barkhampstead, on Cape Cod Bay. Now, and then — that is, once or twice a year — a whaler ship sailed from the wharf, and sometimes, not always, the same ships returned to the wharf. To go and the arrival of a ""whaler"" made Crip's father, Mr. John Allen, happy. It was his busy season, for when the sailors were going, they always wanted to take off new boots and shoes, and when they arrived, they always needed new blankets on their feet to return home."
"Johnny was in shame. ""Drandma"" had put him uncomfortably hard in his little wooden chair near the fireplace, and had told him not to move an inch to the right or to the left until she returned; she had also told him to think about how bad he had been all day, but in a way it seemed easier to think about his grandmother's shortcomings. He looked through his candle tears in the large silver candlestick, and by closing half his eyes he could make three candles, and flashing a little he could see pretty colors; but the fun tended to dry tears, and Johnny wanted to cry. He caught the old cat and watched his tears slip from his smooth fur, but when he held his head on one side and let a large round tear run into his ear, she left him in indignation."
"The largest desert in the world is in Africa, and it is called the Sahara. It is almost as big as the Atlantic Ocean, but instead of the water it is all sands and rocks. As the ocean, it is visited with storms, terrible storms, when the wind rises thousands of tons of sand and pushes them forward, bury and crush everything they encounter. And it has islands, too – small green plots, where the springs bubble through the ground, and ferns and acacias and palm trees grow. When a traveller sees one of these fertile places far away, he feels like a seaman beaten by the storm in sight of the earth. It is delicious to leave the warm sun, cooking, sitting in the shade under the trees, and resting his eyes, long tired of dazzling sands, on the soft green and clear spring. Oases, these islands are called. Long distances divide them. It is often a race for life to cross with one another."
"When my mother was sick, he flew around her, and made a big buzz; and when the girl raised her dinner, he crawled around the tray as if he were hungry. Mamma gave him sugar, which he loved a lot. We missed him once for a whole week. We looked all over the room, but we couldn't find him anywhere. Finally, one day we saw him on the window trying to fly, and what do you think? The poor man had lost one of his wings. Mamma said that he had to fly in the gas light, and burned himself. She gave him sugar, and he seemed better to eat. I looked at him for a long time, and when he had eaten enough he crawled on my hand. I took him off, and I put him back in the window; but he always came back to my hand, and I think that if he could speak, he would have said, ""Thank you, little girl, for my good dinner."""
"Near the south end of the west coast of Ireland, there is a small port called Valentia, as you will see from a map. It faces the Atlantic Ocean, and the nearest point on the opposite bank is a sheltered bay, beautifully called Heart's Content, in Newfoundland. The waters between the two are the most agitated in the world, the anger with hurricanes and cyclones, and rarely smooth even in the calm months of mid-summer. The distance across is nearly two thousand miles, and the depth gradually increases to a maximum of three miles. Between these two points of land — Valentia in Ireland and Heart's Content in Newfoundland — a magic rope is laid, linking America to Europe with a firm link, and allowing the people of London to send instant messages to those of New York."
"There were once three little foxes who lived in a hole in a bank. It was a big comfortable hole, and these three little foxes (two of them were brothers and one was a sister) could lie down and put their heads out of the hole, and see what was happening in the neighborhood. One afternoon, one of the fox brothers slipped by himself for a little walk, and when he came back, he called the other two, and said, ""Oh, come here, I will show you something, and tell you all this."" Then they all lay down together, and looked out of the hole."" Now,"" said the fox brother who had been outside, ""you see this fence there?"" ""Oh yes,"" said his brother and his sister. ""Well, on the other side of this fence is a splendid hen. I went down there and saw it myself."
"Here's a boy drawing on a wall. He's a shoemaker boy. His name is Bob. Tom, the baker's boy, and a little girl named Ann look. ""What is it?"" asks Ann in view of the picture. ""She's a beautiful lady, of course,"" said Tom. ""Do you not see his hair and sun shadow?"" Bob is so busy that he can't stop talking. He's very happy about his work. But the man looking around the corner of the wall doesn't look happy in the least. It's obvious that he doesn't have love for the beautiful arts. Or he may not like to see a sketch so hard on his wall. Maybe he thinks that when boys are sent on a wanderer, they shouldn't be flirting in the way."
"Emma put her Flora doll against the pillow. She said, ""Now, my dear Flora, I want you to be very good tomorrow, because I must have company. It's my birthday."" Emma sat in a chair and said, ""Why, what an old person I will be! I will be four years old; and I will have to go to school soon, and read in my books. I love to look at the pictures now."" Emma went down from the chair, and put Flora there, and said, ""I want you to be very calm now, my child, for I will say my evening prayers. You must not cry; you must not stir; for I will not at all love if you make the least noise."" Emma then said her prayers, and Flora kept all the time."
"I discovered that standing on my toes, halfway through the steps, I could see in the next courtyard, where there were flowers so different from ours, and where there was often a little girl of six or seven years old – about my age – to gather bouquets. She didn't see me first: therefore, for many days I was quietly looking at the amazing little figure. During one of my observations, her mother called her, and a name as she had done! The call, as I heard it, was ""Tobacco, my daughter!"" I felt deeply for the girl who was afflicted by such a name. I decided to throw her by consolation the most beautiful bouquet of grapes on our vineyard. A few days later, when I gave my great family of dolls an air in the garden, I saw a small face looking at me just above the fence."
"Many years ago, when I was a little man, I went on a sail with my uncle Ralph on one of the most beautiful lakes in the north. The day was beautiful, the air was soft but fresh, and the hills and banks around us were dressed in green. Besides Uncle Ralph, in the boat were my aunt Mary, and cousins Walter and Susan Brent. Uncle Ralph was a sportsman, and he had a gun, with which he hoped to bring down a deer, in case he should see one. I did not at all like this part of his plan. I knew that it would be for me and the pleasure of my aunt, if we were made to see the death of a noble deer or a soft fawn. But I loved too much a veil to express my disaffection for Uncle Ralph's plan. At the foot of a hill we stopped in our little boat to pick up bays. Aunt Mary said she would stay and read."
"For a while, the other bears were simple enough to take him to his word. They thought, because he said, that he should be a very large bear. He was never at a loss when they asked him a question, never confessed his ignorance, and many things had to be said that were not true. Dandy boasted so much of the respect that men had given him, that he made them believe that he was giving them a great honor by living with them. He made them all wait on him. But finally, a young bear, who had escaped from a trap that men had set for him, said to Dandy: ""Is this a ring in your nose for ornamentation or for use?"" ""For the ornament, of course,"" said Dandy."
"But the crowd behind him grew and grew, and turned on them, and made them run, all laughing and shouting, in various directions. Finally, as if he had had enough of this kind of fun, he activated his rhythm, driving five or six companions in a saloon, while he was approaching their heels. The boys on the other side of the street laughed at this: he crossed the street quickly, and put them on the run; and the way in which they ran was fun for those who were by the saloon, who were now laughing, in turn. Finally, a man with whom Bruin knew well, and in good conditions, went up, with a chain in his hand, and threw away the neck of the bear; and as if he had had had had had enough walk, Bruin followed his guide quietly, and was brought back to his owner."
"For two or three months, I kept his wings cut off, so that he could not fly away. When I went out for a walk, I usually took him, either in my arms, or perched on my hand; and so I and my pet were known throughout the neighborhood; and when my little playmates invited me to visit them, an invitation was always sent for ""Lillie and his pigeon."" He followed me everywhere. If I read, he was resting on my chair; if he played on the piano, he would listen attentively: indeed, he acquired such a taste for music, that the only time he seemed willing to leave me was to perch me on the foot of a man who sang very finely. I taught him a number of tricks, like bringing me something he could wear, lying down for a long time until I told him to stand up, and run over the keyboards to make music for himself."
"""Let's go find her,"" cried James, the eldest of the three boys. ""Let's all go!"" said Susan, his youngest sister. ""Shall Sport goes with us?"" Emma asked. ""By all means,"" said James. ""Behold, Sport, Sport! Where are you, old man?"" A great black and white Newfoundlander rushed into the shop soon, curling his tail and appearing ready to eat all the children, just to show them how much he was of them all. Then the children all went to Mr. Spicer's shop. There, they learned that no Elfrida had been seen in the shop that afternoon. ""Where could she be?"" cried James, a little anxious. ""Sport, where is Elfrida?"" The sport stopped his nonsense to play with a stick and began to sound serious."
"My friend John lives in Colorado, not far from Denver; and he writes to me, that he and his sister, not long ago, have gone out to see some prairie dogs. The prairie dog is about the size of a complete squirrel, and of a similar color. He makes a hole for himself in the ground. This hole is in the shape of a tunnel, and as large as a man's hat. Now, this little dog is so sweet, that he lets the owl and rattle come and live with him, if they want it. All three are often found to live together. For my part, I shouldn't much like these neighbors. Prairie dogs live on the roots of the grass. Scattered all around the entrance of their houses, you can see the remains of the dry roots they got for food. They are fast in their movements, and very fun."
"The chestnut logs, you know, are covered with sharp thorns; and yet the bear, who loved chestnuts very much, tried to reach the nuts that he knew about them, mocking themselves and making very comic faces, because the logs were stinging his mouth. Solomon looked at him, looked at him, and thought it was a nice pleasure. But he approached to do it too often; for one day, when he had worn the bear a hat of logs, with the intention of having a good laugh on him, the chain that held the bear was not as firmly attached as usual. After trying two or three logs, the bear made a spring to Solomon, withdrew from his chain, and began after him with seriousness. Solomon soon decided that he had something to do that time, besides the laugh, and began to hurry out of the way of the bear. Now, there was a ladder on the barn, and there was a ladder on the side of Solomon's barn."
"We, the children, were far from danger; and another man and Henry, chopped and chopped, until he was almost ready to fall, when they retreated, and, in less than a minute, there was such a whistling in the air, such an accident, and a break of branches, and then a loud noise! The tree had come down. I felt quite inhaled by the excitement; and the others also; for a few minutes before we ran to see how many nuts there were. Oh, so many things! all lay down, and fought out of the prickly loggers, all ready for us. I don't remember how much we were gathered, but it was a few bushels; and we couldn't take all that day; so we concluded to return the next afternoon after school. And what do you think?"
"I first told my story, as moms usually do, and it was about a little naughty pig, who didn't care about her mother when she told her to stay in the sty, but he crawled into a hole in the wall. Of course this pig came into the garden, and was whipped by the farmer, and bitten by the dog, and had all sorts of unpleasant things happen to her, until he was happy to come back to the sty. ""Now I'm going to tell you a story of pig,"" said Birdie, with a very wise look. ""Once there was a great pig mother, and she had a lot of child-pigs. One was spotted, and her name was Spotty; the tail of one was frown, and he was Curly; another was white, and he was white; another was Browny; and another was Greeny."""
"She had an affectionate look at her fawn, she continued to have breakfast. But suddenly she began, with her head raised, her eyes dilated, a trembling in her limbs. She turned her head southward; she listened intensely. There was a sound, a distinct note, prolonged, invading the woods. He repeated himself. The doe had no doubt now. It was the robbery of a dog – far from there, at the foot of the mountain. Enough time to fly; enough time to put miles between her and the dog before he came on his fresh track; yes, enough time. But there was the fawn; the dog's cry was repeated, more distinct this time. The mother read a few steps; the fawn began with an anxious buzz; she came back; she could not leave him. She was moving away from the west, and the little beast was moving away from her legs."
"In his habits he is shy; and his voice can often be heard while the eye seeks in vain to find the bird himself. His food consists of caterpillars and various insects. The female cuckoo does not make a nest, and does not take care of his youth. How do you think she does it? Having a big beak, she takes in him one of her eggs, which she puts in the nest of another bird that feeds on insects. The strange nurses to whom the cuckoo entrusts his youth become not only good mothers for them, but neglect their own children to take care of the young cuckoos. As the young cuckoo prospers and grows strong, he pushes the other birds out of the nest, so that he can have all the room for himself. For five weeks or more his adoptive mother provides him with food."
"So Mr. Starling stole from Mrs. Sparrow. Mr. Sparrow, without further delay, went to Mr. Starling. Mrs. Sparrow's brother-in-law paid tribute to Mrs. Starling. There was a lively fight. It ended in the defeat of the sparrows. The sparrows were too big for them. The sparrows folded in good order, and let the sparrows enjoy their triumph. ""Now, my dear,"" said Mr. Starling, ""enter, and put the house in order. I will assure you that these vulgar sparrows have made a nice mess in there."
"One day, as the train passed through the woods at high speed, a partridge, flying from one part of the forest to another, scared and stunned by the noise, fell against the fireplace and fell at the engineer's feet. The engineer, whose name was Nathaniel Grant, took the poor bird scared, gently caressed his stifled feathers, and carried him carefully to his house. There, the partridge was treated with the greatest kindness, and soon she resumed her bruises. But she wanted the quiet woods, where her life had passed. She could not eat, and seemed almost to break her heart with a lot of house. The next day, when Mr. Grant resumed the engine, he took the bird with him."
"As soon as she could see her funny little grey eyes, she began to try to get out of the box. She wanted to see what was out there, where Malta was going. She climbed a little way, then returned to Miss Tittens and Coudle, which made them say, ""Mew,"" and make Teddikins laugh; but Spitfire always said, ""Spts!"" and tried again. Finally, one day we heard a gourd; and we looked around us, and there was Spitfire on the ground. She climbed up to the top of the box, and she groaned over the edge, and there she stood, with her right tail in the air, and her legs apart, looking at us, and saying, ""Spts!"" Maltie was very proud of her kittens, and used to take Cudle and Miss Tittens in her mouth, and carry them in the dining room when we ate our breakfast, to show them to us."
"I leaned closer to the ground to see if I could find a clue to the mystery, and I discovered that the dust all around the great spider was alive with little ones that she had just shaken. And how did they ever get up on her back? Did they run on her thin legs, and the crowd and squat? How would I have wanted to know the language of the spider, that I could find out why this mother weighed herself with such a burden of little ones as she walked in the street! Did she give them an air, and showed them the world? or had a housewife's broom sweep her canvas, and thus forced her to take the plane to save her family from destruction? Maybe she had been burned. Or was it the first day of May for her? and her owner had driven her out of her house because she couldn't pay the rent? Alas! she couldn't tell me; and I left her there with all her little ones around her."
"Aunt Minnie couldn't coax him with green leaves or seeds. He insisted on making himself unhappy until the baby came out for a diffusion. Then he exploded again in song, and seemed to feel that he was in his old place, — the only treasure. It was long before the poor little bird discovered that Aunt Minnie's heart was big enough to love him and his precious baby too. But he now learns it, and likes to have baby held up to his cage. When Aunt Minnie lets him out in the room, he jumps near the baby; and baby laughs, and spreads his pit hands to catch him; but he is wise enough to stand out of the baby's way. Don't you think it's nice for Aunt Minnie to have such treasures?"
"Billy was the old family horse, kind, sweet and loving. Anyone could catch him, or drive him, or drive him. He liked to be robbed, and in return seemed to take the pride of being kind to all in the family. Tom was also a good horse; but we had not possessed him so long, and he didn't care much about having someone burglary. Billy was a little lame; and although he worked everywhere on the farm, and drawing loads on the road, but he was usually excused to go with the car, except when it was necessary for some of us children to drive. One day my father went to the village with Tom, leaving Billy alone at home, in a field near the house. His old friend Tom was missing. They had so much worked together, that they had become great friends; and one of them was very lonely without the other."
"One day, when my father wanted to go to the mill, he sent my brother Robert to the pasture to catch Billy. Robert brought the horse home, bound him to the fence in the garden, and gave him oats in a bucket. In a pen of the house, we kept three pigs: two of them were white; and the other was spotted, black and white. These pigs came out of the enclosure, pushing a board on one side of this one. Shortly after Billy had begun to eat his dinner, the two white pigs came to run into the garden. They saw Billy eating his oats; and, thinking that it would be nice for them to have as much as he could, they ran to his bucket, and without even saying, ""By your permission,"" began to help themselves. Billy had no idea of sharing his dinner with such a company as this one: he took off his ears, looked at the cross as he could, threw himself at the pigs with his teeth, hit them with his feet, hit them with his teeth."
"One pleasant and dry day, last fall, I saw her sitting on the grass. I went up to tell her not to sit there, for he is not sure whether to sit on the ground, even in dry weather. As I approached Jessie from behind, I heard her speak. Who could she speak to? There was no one by her side; that is, no human being. But soon I found that she was talking to a wasp who was coming like to sting her."
"General Tommy felt a weight of responsibility on his shoulders, and, like a prudent soldier, he resolved not to go to battle until his army was large enough to ensure victory. So he entered Queen Lucy the first as a recruit. Queen Lucy looked very large in her paper hat with a feather at the top. She wore a weapon; and General Tommy taught him how to shoot. When all were ready for the beginning, he sounded trumpet. The army walked in an excellent order along the entrance, into the playroom; and not a soldier retreated as they came to the sight of the enemy. ""Halt!"" cried General Tommy. The army stopped. The traitor, ""Dandy Jim,"" stood in a state, pointing his sword, and the dolls stood still."
"To tell the truth, my sympathies were divided. The bright-eyed little mouse was so cunning and fast, that I thought to myself, ""What a pity to kill such a brilliant little guy!"" But then I knew how disappointed poor Breezy would be, if she had to wake up, and learn in one way or another that a mouse had run over the ground while she was sleeping in an inglorious sleep. I came to mouse quite boldly, and, finding some crumbs under the table, nibbling them in great haste. Poor little guy, if I had had some cheese, I would have been tempted to give her, there and then. But suddenly, Breezy woke up, and saw what was happening. Musie, however, had not been so stupid, while making her meal, as not to keep an eye open on her enemy. Quick as a flash, he ran for the little crack that was leading under the closet, and thus made his escape."
"One day, Freddie got his father to build him a small shelf on the tree, about four feet from the ground, so that he could put nuts on it to feed the squirrels. First, the little people were very shy, and did not approach the shelf, but sat on the branches of the tree; and we thought that we would hear them say to each other: ""Do you think that this little boy would hurt us, if we had to go down and take one of these nuts?"" But, after a while, they went down, one to another, took the nuts, and went up to the upper branches; and in a few minutes, they went down empty shells."
"Dodger is a Scottish terrier full of blood. His eyes are the brightest of all bright eyes; and he acts as one might assume from his name. He does not move here and there, under the couch, and behind the stove, and in a chair, and he sometimes puts his legs on the baby's cradle. The other day, the baby's red sock fell off his foot; and Dodger picked it up with elegance, and, going to a corner of the room, ate the red cups that were on it. I don't think he will do it again; for he didn't act as if they had tasted very good. Dodger has a lot of crafty manners. He will bring his master's slippers, sit straight, pretend to be dead, and do many other funny things."
"One day last summer, during the great Centenary exhibition in Philadelphia, I heard a conversation that interested me a lot. The subject was a strange little animal called a ""gopher"", who was stuck in a business with his little comic head perched in the air; for he was not even alive, but was a poor little teddy gopher. In front of the case, I noticed two farmers, who were talking about my boyfriend in a very serious way: so I listened to their remarks. ""Yes,"" said one, ""I tell you that he is a terrible creature to dig. Why, he gives us a view of troubles out of our way! Can't keep anything he can dig, away from him."" ""Is that right?"" said the other man."
"One evening, the man who was sleeping on the floor of the machinery house, to be ready for everything if there was a fire alarm, heard a great noise down, a stamp and a jump, as if the horses were preparing to go to a fire, when there was no alarm. He went slowly to the stairs, and looked down; and he shoved Jim, jumping over the trees of the pipe carriage, first in one way and then in another, just for fun. One day, Jim was in the courtyard behind the machinery house, and a man went out to catch him, and drove him. But he rushed and penetrated into the courtyard, and would not let himself be caught. Then the man went to drive him; and what do you think Jim would have done? Instead of entering the open door, he made a jump, and entered the open window, without breaking a glass, or hurt himself at least."
"""Why, when a guy says that he has the best marbles, and the best kite, and the fastest sled, and the most beautiful velocipede, and the best known dog, anywhere in town, we say that he speaks is very big me and small you. That is, we mean that he still boasts; and a braggart is a very unpleasant person,"" said Wallace. ""Herbie looked at Georgie, and the two of them blushed a bit. The boys had a lot of fun with their kites; and when they came home, Wallace and Herbie went up stairs to keep the kite away,"" said Herbie, ""Well, my kite beat Georgie, just like I told him."" ""It's true,"" said Wallace; ""but you said the other day that you loved Georgie, and didn't love him, because he always said that his things were much bigger and better than yours; you didn't have to give you, you didn't have to give you, you didn't have to, you had to give you, you had to give you, you didn't you, you had to give you."
"One night came a terrible storm of wind and rain. When I woke up in the morning, and opened my window, there were the old pebbles flying around the garden in great distress, making such a terrible cry, that I went out to see what was going on. What do you think I saw? The pretty nest was on the ground, torn apart by the wind; and the little baby birds were lying in the cold wet grass, crying pitifully. The old birds were flying, and beating the grass with their wings. I ran home, and found an old pewter bucket. I lined it with beautiful hay from Billy's stable, took the poor little pebbles, and put them in the hot dry hay. Then I leaned the bucket on a branch of the bush, tied it firmly with a little string, and I went into the house to look at the old birds from my window."
"We keep crickets in a box, and find them very interesting. They are very active, and they take care of laying eggs, digging holes, eating, singing and running. Only the males sing, and their wings are very rough, and curiously marked. The crickets have four kinds of different wings,—yellow, brown, black and brownish-red. Those with yellow wings seem less resistant than the others. They do not sing so well, but lay and eat more. Brown-winged crickets are quite common, but not as common as black-winged crickets, which are the most common of all kinds. Brown-winged crickets are very rare. Those who are black with yellow spots where the wings come out, sing the best. The eggs are yellow, about an eighth inch long, and oval in shape."
"What a power there is in goodness! It is very pleasant to form these friendships with birds, so that they learn to trust you and to love you. The sound of the human voice often seems to have a strange effect on animals, as if they almost understood your words. My sister would say: ""Hello, sir! Come in! Don't make a stranger. These difficult moments; but you will find a lot of crumbs on the table. Don't be snoring. You don't steal from us. Try, you can't eat us out of home and home. You have a great appetite, right? Oh, well, eat away! No cat walks around. The little bird, as if he knew my sister was talking to him, would be boring, and seems quite happy. As soon as the hot weather came, his visits were not so frequent; but, from time to time, he would make his appearance, as if to say: ""Don't forget me, Helen."
"Jenny and Eva did not know how to swim: they jumped in the water, while Dora took Kate on her back, and swam after Tom. She soon lifted her head under the water; but Tom climbed up like a cork, and slammed all the water on Dora. ""It will do, Tom,"" she said, ""Now Andy, come here, and take this little girl on your back, and carry her on the dry sand."" Dora placed Kate on the back of the good dog, and the little girl threw her arms around her neck, and swam with her through the deep water, and carried her high on the dry and warm sand, where a lady and a gentleman were sitting, and another lady sat down with a sunburn on her head. But when Kate saw Tom and the girls falling in the water, she shouted, ""Oh, give me more of the Atlantic Ocean. I like her."""
"One day, the aunt heard a great crowd in the barn, and went out to see what was going on. When she opened the door, the two horses were in their cabins, and everything was quiet. She noticed that the lunch-box was open; she shut it, and went out. Before she came home, the noise started again, and she returned quietly, and threw herself into the window. There was Billy, who was dipping his nose in the lunch-box, which he had opened. ""Billy, what are you doing?"" said the aunt; and it was quite fun to see him whipping in his cabin, and standing there as quiet and standing as a cat that had just been taken by eating the cream. Billy had slipped the stop, and had therefore released himself. Since then, he was attached more safely; but he still managed to get free from time to time."
"Among the Azores, there is the beautiful island of Fayal, with its orange groves and its profusion of flowers. But, despite the fruits and flowers, there is one thing that the Americans who live there sadly lack, and it is fresh and fresh water. There are no lakes or ponds, as we have here; and so people have to use rainwater, whether they save in large tanks or cisterns. There are some wells on the island, which, as the water rises and falls into them twice every twenty-four hours, are called ""tide wells."" But a time ago, several years ago, people had no tanks or wells, and were forced to get water from the hollows in the rocks. And that's the story of the first well. The year 1699 was a year when little rain fell."
"Louise was a sweet little girl, and Fanny was a very muscular pony; therefore Fanny had all her way. When she walked along the road, with Louise on her back, if she had had the opportunity to spy on a nice thistle on a bank, she scrambled, as fast as she could go, the sand and gravel rolling under her hooves; and, no matter how Louise shot at the reins, she would stay there until she ate the thistle to the roots. Then she would go back to the bank, and trot on. Fanny liked other good things outside of the thistles. She would spy on an apple on a tree, no matter how thick the leaves were; and, without waiting to ask for permission from Louise, she ran under the tree, stretched her head in the branches, and even got up on her hind legs, like a dog, to reach the apple."
"One day, last summer, while I was sitting on the edge of the river, looking at the beautiful blue water that shoved proudly to the edge of the water, but Mrs. Hen, with another brood of small yellow ducks, who were running behind her! She took them to the edge of the water, saw them start, and, turning aside, was content to scratch some weeds on the shore, no longer knowing her little family. She had come to consider this swim thing as a matter of course. Now, a little duck, for some reason, — maybe he wasn't so strong as the others, — had not gone into the water with the rest, but was sitting on the shore. Currently, the mother-hen, turning around, came to spy on her. She stopped scratching, and looked at it as if she were saying, ""All my chickens were swimming: now, what are you? I know that's parse; and I didn't win."""
"He read the letters. One of them was very unpleasant, on the part of a merchant who bought a forest on his wife's property. The sale of this forest was absolutely essential; but, until he was reconciled with his wife, the subject could not be discussed. The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests had to enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife. And the idea that he could be directed by his interests, that he could seek reconciliation with his wife because of the sale of the forest — this idea hurt him. When he finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevich moved the office newspapers near him, looked quickly through two pieces of business, made some notes with a large pencil, and pushed the papers back, turned to his coffee."
"One summer afternoon, when the grassy slope before the house was untied with fallen leaves, sticks, and wilted flowers, I asked Garry to go and bring the rake so that we could clear the garbage. So he ran, and soon came back with an iron rake. Now, if you have tried one, you will know that an iron rake is not as good for it as a wooden rake, as it is heavy, and the teeth are so sharp that they tear the roots of the grass. I used it for a while; but despite all that I could do, the teeth would grab the roots. Finally Garry exclaimed, ""Great mother, let me take it. I can do it well."" I gave it to him, and the dear little boy took it behind a log, and I was very busy and quiet for several minutes."
"Davie and Harold are two little boys from Boston. They are brothers. Last summer they had two nice little yachts given by a friend. Then they had a launch in the bathtub; and their mamma named the yachts, breaking a bottle of water (a small bottle of medicine) on the bows. Davie's yacht was called the ""West Wind"" and Harold's, the ""Flyaway"". One afternoon, the boys went to City Point, rented a rowboat, and rowed towards half of Fort Independence, where they put the small boats in the water for a try-trip. It was a nice view to see the sails fill with the wind, and the small yachts ride the waves as if they wanted to go to China before they stopped. The ""West Wind"" beat the ""Flyaway"", and I regret to say that Davie hit his brother with the fact, and made him cry; for Harold is a boy who takes all things to heart."
"One day, Fred found an old saddle in the stable; and he proposed to Bertie to help him put it on the calf, and to have a turn of the rope. They managed to fix it on Buttercup's smooth back; and Freddie exclaimed with pleasure: ""Now we will have a first-class circus!"" They brought a chair from the house, and placed it on Miss Cow's side, and looked at them with great eyes. The two boys stood in the chair, and Fred said: ""Now, I count, and when I say four, we must go out on the saddle. One—two—three—four;"" and they went away. But, before they could say ""five"" heels of Miss Buttercup were in the air, and his head descended so quickly, that Master Fred suddenly felt cold, and found himself in a bathtub of rain water that was under the logs of the wood; while Bertie went the furthest into a pot of food and water."
"Once a fly lighted up on one of the boats, and took a long journey. This made Emma think of trying to find other passengers; and she took a large beetle from the ground, and put it on board. Poor beetle! he didn't want to go, and he wasn't used to it. He shoved on the bridge; the boat ran down under him, and the following thing Emma knew he was overboard. ""Oh, he shouldn't drown!"" she exclaimed. I have to get him out! And she threw herself in great haste to save the poor beetle. But it was a big bathtub, and a very deep one too; and what did Emma know to be careful? She lost her balance, and she descended into the water, with a great splash that destroyed all the boats in the same moment."
"Sometimes she goes out with her uncle behind her black ponies; and, if the road is smooth and flat, he lets Madie hold the reins. But she prefers to go with him on the water, in her beautiful sailboat, ""Ildrian"", which is a Spanish name, and means ""fleet like lightning."" When the weather is beautiful, and the water is calm, her aunts take her row in their pretty boat, ""Echo."" While they raze on the shore, stopping from time to time to gather water lilies, Madie looks at the pretty cottages and white tents nestled among the green trees, where the people of the city spend their summer. They pass a lot of boats on the way, filled with ladies and gentlemen, who greet them; and Madie floats her handkerchief, and her small flag in the other, as they pass. Sometimes they go to land in a shaded cove; and Aunt Clara fills her basket with ferns and mosses, while Madie takes up the rocks and rocks."
"One morning in September, before breakfast, Ned and Harry went to the canker hunt. They took Dick, who is a great coach dog, big, spotted, and Gyp, a little black-and-tan, with short ears, and fear of a mouse, both ""these splendid hunters,"" said Harry. Gyp ran in front of three legs; and Dick walked sedatively behind. Ned wore the bow, and Harry, the three arrows; and it was enough to shake any wise canker to see them. At first they crossed a field of potatoes, then a meadow where there was a stream, and where they lost Gyp so often in the peatlands, that Harry finally carried it to know where he was. Dick ran into the stream, and shook himself on Ned's new combination; but it was not serious."
"What should we do in our house if it wasn't for our aunt Matilda? She is the first out of bed in the morning, and the last to go to bed at night. She sees that things are just in the kitchen, and just in the living room. Father wants her breakfast at six and a half this summer time. Aunt Matilda gets up before five, and calls the girls, and sees that the rooms are in order. Then she calls the children to be washed and dressed. Yes, it is a good resemblance of her, as you see she combs my hair. She is not young, you see, nor even very old. Sometimes I am a little impatient, and fidget, because she is so special; but our quarrels always end up kissing her, and say, ""You are an aunt dear, after all."""
"This summer, he visited his aunt in the city, and was very interested in the curiosities and sounds abounding in it. A few days after he returned home, when his mother sat in the square with some friends, Willie climbed the gravel road with his little wheelbarrow on his back. He stopped at the foot of the steps, put his burden, rested him on the handles, so that he stood up. Then, holding him with one hand, and rolling the wheel with the other, he kept his foot standing and falling, as if he were at work with a real foot. He looked very sober, and said, ""Please, ma'am, do you have scissors to sharpen?"" The ladies handed him several pairs, which he melted in the best style, trying the edge with his finger, and finally passing them to the owner with the request of ten hundred."
"One day, Uncle Wash was ploughing, and he put me on Old Whitey's back. Well, I liked it very much, and I started to grin, and jerk off the reins, to make him go; when in an instant, without any warning, he raised his ears, he hit his heels, and fled, leaving the plough behind. I can't tell you how scared I was. I stood as long as I could; but it was useless. The old horse ran into the marshes and peat bogs, and dumped me, head to head, in the mud and dirt. I was wounded on the head and side, but I didn't want to cry because I was too tall for that."
"When she goes out to walk, she finds her way as well as she can by groping with her great umbrella. Very often she loses her way, and goes in the wrong direction; and sometimes she disorients herself; but I have never known her to be really lost or injured. There is always someone to straighten her up; and it is nice to see how good everyone is for her. A lot of time I have seen a gentleman, while rushing to catch her train, stopping to help her on the crossing; or a well dressed lady takes her by the arm, and the place, when she goes astray. But the best thing is to see the children so kind to her. She comes to our place every Saturday; and, as she is very fit to go to the wrong door, the little girls — without their dear hearts! — seem to consider their duty to guide her, and to help her in slipper places."
"She began to put a small tin plate on the top of the pot, kissed the precious baby, and then went out again. The baby Lila used to be left alone, although rarely out of the mamma's hearing. She then sat among the pillows, throwing her trinkets all around, and crunching at her own performances. Sometimes she fell against a pillow, and fell asleep. But this morning Lila did not intend to go to sleep. She prospered the pusher, and laughed at the pin; then meditatively looked at the bright window, and seriously reflected on the wide sun belt that was across the ground."
"About three years ago, a lady gave me a small safe, and I kept my magazines there since. Last winter, when the snow was on the floor, and I had to stay in the house a good deal, I used to take my safe and sit on the floor by mommy, and look at my ""Nursery"" through almost every day. So mom thought she would like my picture to be taken this way. Now I have to introduce my dog, Beauty, who is sitting by my side in the picture. You see that he is a Spitz; but don't be afraid: he will never have any hydrophobia. I can't think of making him muzzle, because one of his charms is the way he opens and closes his mouth when he barks. Oh, no, Beauty! I'm never going to hurt your feelings by making you wear a muzzle."
"It is on these islands that their nests are built, they take a lot of time and trouble to make them, and they use beautiful algae, mosses and dry sticks, in order to make them as strong as they can. When the mother laid four or five eggs, which are of a beautiful green colour, she removes some of the soft grey that grows on her chest, to cover them, and keep them warm, while she leaves to find food. And now, what do you think? Why, when she comes back to sit on her eggs, she finds that all her eggs and beautiful down have been removed! Oh, how she cries, and beats her wings, to find her cherished eggs gone!"
"So, on a day when Mr. Topliff, who runs a big toy store, told Edwin, ""I'll pay you well for the most of those toy houses you can do,"" Edwin replied, ""I'm going to work as soon as I finish this hook; because a little money is exactly what I want."" Edwin had learned by practice to use his saw with great skill, and he always took pains to do his job well. Little by little, he learned to do the finer kind of cabinet work; and then he perplexed his mind to invent new varieties of toys, and other things often sought as Christmas gifts. Mr. Topliff said, ""You can earn your life by this kind of work, if you choose Edwin."" But no! Edwin had decided to go to college; and so he replied, ""If I can pay my university fees by working on odd hours, Mr. Topliff, I want to do it."""
"She was very vain, that is, she had a very good opinion of herself. She was always jerking herself off while walking. Indeed, it was difficult for her to pick up corn grains like other chickens. I think she never saw her feet in her life: she certainly didn't look where she was walking. Worse than all that, when she saw anyone in the yard, instead of going away, as a modest chicken should, she was jerking herself to such a person, and looking up in her face as if she were asking, ""Who are you? Where are you going? Why? Why? Why? Finally? However, Strut received a severe reprimand for her bad ways. Cousin William Bird, who will soon be a doctor, was visiting Father Nunn. Having the opportunity to climb the ladder at the barn-loft, he saw Strut on the other side. He knew that she would come directly to him; and he also knew that she would not look where she would walk."
"""Well, Murphy & Flynn, I'm going to use you to do my shovel today, and I'll give you fifty cents for work; but I'm very special. You don't have to leave a little snow somewhere on the steps or the sidewalk."" ""Very well, sir,"" said the boys; ""and they went to work, while Mr. Prim went back to his newspaper. He didn't read much minutes, when a loud cry in front of the house led him to look out the window. The picture shows what he saw. There were the two boys, each mounted on one of the stone lions at the head of the steps, and shouting at the top of his lungs in the excitement of an imaginary race. Mr. Prim was first surprised, then angry, then amused, at this performance. He opened the window, and suddenly called, ""Look, boys! Call this work, or play?"""
"Wallace, being a little boy, calls for his help the saddle horse of his father. This horse is a nice and gentle creature, and as wise as he is good. He and Wallace are at about the same age, and have always been good friends. So, when Wallace puts the saddle on him every night, just before night, the horse knows exactly what will be done. He looks at the boy with his big bright eyes, as much as saying, ""We have our evening work to do, right, Wallace? Well, I'm ready: jump on."" Wallace climbs the horse; and they go straight to the nearest pole. Here the horse stops by the pole, and stands as still and stable as the pole itself. Then Wallace stands on the saddle, takes a match from his pocket, lights the lamp, quickly falls into his seat, takes the bridle, gives the word to the horse, and on they go to the next pole."
"When he was only a few months old, he followed us to the church without us knowing him; and we did not see him, until, in the most solemn part of the service, we heard a drummer, a drummer, a drummer, who climbed the alley, and there stood Phantom at the door of our bench. In his mouth was a long-handed feather pusher, which he had found in a dark corner of the building, and where he had been carefully put (as he was supposed) out of the way of everyone. Phantom is very intelligent, and has learned a number of tricks. He can understand what is said to him better than any dog I have ever known; but he is better known among the children here for his love of music and singing. He has yet learned only one song; but he knows that as soon as he hears it."
"She wore the kitten in the kitchen, and quickly got from the cook a nice saucepan of milk. Her little brother Harry came to run to see the new kitten eat her dinner, and with him came the old family cat, Mouser, who rubbed and sprayed against Alice, as if he wanted her to caress him too. The next thing was to find a name, ""pretty, and not too common,"" Alice said. While she was trying to think of one, she went up to her own little room and looked among her ribbons for a piece to tie around the neck of the kitten. She quickly found one that was just the thing. In one of her drawers, she found a little bell that someone had given her and thought it would be a good plan to hang that around Kitty's neck by the ribbon. Kitty has no objection to be so decorated, and a happy thought hit Alice; ""Kitty Bell would just be the name for her!"" and Kitty Bell it was."
"""But why?"" he exclaimed, while the handmaid was throwing an earbrush at her head. No one yet told her why. But a man just came upstairs. ""Why, what a mess!"" he said. ""Oh, I see! It's this puppy. I thought he knew he shouldn't come in."" ""So I did it; but I didn't know why,"" the puppy grunted, like, with the painful back and the lame foot, he crept under a chair. ""Come, go out!"" cried the man. ""I won't have you in the house at all. Out with you!"" And he grabbed him with a strong hand and chained him in a stall. ""You could have stopped, and played on the grass if you had stayed there,"" said the man. ""But, as you will come into the house when you shouldn't, you must be kept where you can't do it."""
"The horse and the cow, in great pain, came to stand beside the white sheep while lying on the grass. They loved him despite all his faults. ""Oh, why!"" cried the cow, with tears in the eyes (and the bell that was hanging around his neck trembled and sounded as it leaned on him), ""Why did you leave the field with the black sheep?"" ""He did it first,"" said the white with a weak voice. ""Then why did you jump on this abrupt place? Do you not see that it was a pit? ""I did not stop seeing it. He did it first,"" said the white sheep. ""Then, with a groaning, he continued to ask, ""How are the black sheep? Is he also there? And what does the man who comes to see us think?"""
"At nightfall, the boat, taking advantage of the darkness, rose to the surface of the sea and sailed without light. Andrey was standing on the bridge all night long. The water was calm, the stars were projected by a light mist, and far south, the pale blue glow of an enemy projector was moving through the clouds. The ship was now approaching a minefield. At dawn, when the green-orange light began to slowly invade the polar clouds, Kate sank to a great depth at a point permanently fixed in the sea. Going only by compass and map, she began to take her way under the mines. Yakovlev was in charge of the steering apparatus, while Prince Bylopolsky calculated the lateral drift and brought back to the chief engineer in charge of the engines. Andrey, leaning on the map, gave orders to the man at the wheel. There was no feeling of movement, and it seemed that the Kate was still standing in the middle of the darkness."
"Mr. D. had promised to give his wife a beautiful rattan chair as a Christmas present. It was her job to sell these items. In due course, Mrs. D. called her place of business, and chose a chair; but while she sat and enjoyed for a few minutes, a new idea came to her mind, and she told her husband that she would gladly do without her present if he would give Jennie and Alice (their two little daughters) each a chair. Her husband accepted this; and on Christmas evening, he took with him two elegant little rocking chairs. Leaving them in his garden, he went into tea, and, after taking a seat at the table, said to his children, ""I have a story to tell you, and that's a true story. Do you want to hear it?"""
"An old duck wandered into the barn and saw himself in the mirror. ""There's another duck,"" she said. ""I wonder who she is."" And she walked towards the reflection. ""She's rather friendly,"" continued the duck. ""She walks towards me. What big feet she has, but her feathers are very beautiful."" Just then she hit herself in the mirror. ""Well!"" she exclaimed; ""if this duck isn't in a glass box! Why are you in there?"" ""Well, you don't have to answer if you don't want to,"" she said, walking. ""A glass box is a good place for you."" Just then a pig came, and her nose bewitched, he came in front of the mirror. ""What are you doing here?"""
"At that time, there were no steam ships and no regular packages from Europe. The only way to come was by a merchant-ship. Bernard, who sought and desired the arrival of his brother, did not think it was strange when six weeks passed without bringing him. But when two months passed, and he did not appear, poor Bernard began to worry. Four months, five months, six months passed. Nothing was heard from John. There did not come a word from Mr. Trainer. More than a year passed, and again there was no news. Bernard was in despair. One day in August (he must have been, I think, in the year 1805), when my father had the opportunity to visit Boston, he took Bernard with him; and while there he went with him to call Mr. Duprez, from whom they hoped to hear good news."
"I like babies very much. One of the reasons, I think, is that they can't hurt me with their little hands. They pull my ears, but not as hard as to make me suffer. Once, a hot day, when my mouth was open, and my tongue was outside, Dot took my tongue, and pulled it as hard as possible. I didn't even say Bow-wow. I didn't even let him get away. I would have all the people know that this baby shouldn't be touched while I'm here. If you come near to disturb baby, I will abode; but, if you try to touch him, I will bite. So, be careful. You don't even have to touch the baby rattle on the floor. I hear my mistress tell people what I'm a good dog, and how she can trust me to take care of a baby. Yes, I'm proud to say that I'm doing my duty."
"The Easter egg is a painted or coloured egg used for an Easter gift, a day that occurs on Sunday, the second day after Friday. The term ""Egg of Easter"" is supposed to derive from a Saxon word meaning rising; and Easter is a feast of the Christian Church to commemorate the resurrection. In the picture, the children hunt the Easter eggs, which the good mother has hidden in different parts of the room. The child who finds the most eggs will have the pleasure of making gifts from them to whom he or she can choose. Baby has put her eyes on the egg that is on the ground. If he takes it, I hope he will not let it fall, and break it. The other children will not be slow to find the painted eggs. There must be a dozen, or more, of them hidden away."
"Arthur had looked at some photos in a book; but he did not quite understand what they were: so he called Uncle Oscar to explain. Uncle Oscar took it on his knee, and said, ""This, Arthur, is an image of the flax plant, a very useful plant indeed; for of him we make linen. Your apron is linen: so are the collar and bracelets on my shirt. ""The flax plant carries delicate blue flowers, which seem very pretty when in flower. The linen is raised very widely in Kentucky, and other states in the Union. Do you know what part of the plant is the stem? I will point it out to you in the photo. Well, from this stem the yarn, or fibres, are obtained, from which the linen fabric is made. The linen is drawn a little before the seeds are ripe: it is stripped, and the stems are soaked in the water. The linen is then dried, and broken and beaten to the yarns, or fibres, to turn the bark."
"We thought that she could not have done everything, but that a negligent person had left the chest open, and the door was not fixed. So Jenny was brought back to her display and tied; the lid of the chest was closed, and the door closed and tied with a hook. About an hour later, by entering the stable again, Ms. Jenny was found as before, with her nose deep in the lunch box, munching away with great pleasure. Then we knew that she had to pick up and open the door, and lifted the cover, as well as picked up her stop. Don't you think she was smart enough for a horse? Dad says it was smarter than honest to steal the meal that way. But I guess the horses don't know much about honesty. Jenny all the better for her intelligence, and I made a great animal of her ever since. As she likes so much food, I take care to give her so much that she won't have to steal it."
"The other children laughed; but a movement of the master's hand restored silence, and, turning to Katie, he said: ""Now, my child, for your delay, you will have a black mark, and descend into your class; but, Katie, for lying, you will lose your place in my heart, and I cannot so much love you. But I will forgive you, if you will stand in the corner of your own accord. What will you do, - lose your place in my heart, or will you stand in the corner for a quarter of an hour? The child burst into a stream of tears, and sobbing, ""I prefer to go to the corner,"" went there instantly, and turned his dear little face towards the wall. In a few minutes, the master called her, and, as she came to run to him, he said: ""Do you promise me, Katie, never again say what is not true?"""
"Boy Blue's father went to the men who made hay, and said, ""Men, the men, have you seen my Boy Blue?"" But the men answered, ""No, no, we didn't see Boy Blue. But just then they looked under a woodcock; and there, all wrapped up, the blue boy, and his dog Tray, asleep; his father shook him by his arm, saying, ""Boy Blue, wake up, wake up! The sheep are in the meadow, and the cows are in the corn."" The boy Blue threw himself at his feet, grabbed his tin horn, and ran as fast as he could to the corn field, with his little dog running by his side. He blew on his horn, ""Tot, toot, toot!"" and all the cows ran up, saying, ""Moo, moo!"" He led them to the barn to be dragged."
"I never had much chance of catching trout. One summer, I left the city to try out the streams of trout in northern New York. I had a nice stem and a nicely baited line of an artificial fly; but, although I was very persistent, my success was small. I remember sitting for hours on the thin bridge just below the upper Cascades of the Buttermilk Falls, shown in the picture; but my patience was not rewarded by the capture of a single trout. I was sorry for that; for I had relied on getting a trout for my dinner."
"My boyfriend Mabel spends the summer in the middle of the Catskill Mountains. These mountains are in New York, west of the Hudson River. The round top and the upper top, two of the highest peaks, are about thirty-eight hundred feet above sea level. They are well covered with forests, and in the autumn, when the leaves begin to change, they make a very bright show. The Catskill-Mountain House is finely located on a rocky terrace, twenty-two hundred feet above the river. It is twelve miles from the village of Catskill, and is widely used in the summer season. The prospect of this house is quite wide. Mabel writes to me that the view of the sunrise is great; the air is fresh and fresh; and the sight of the tops of trees running below, like a sea, for miles, is one thing to remember."
"He heard his mother call him, but did not take note of his call. It was a warm summer day, and he fell asleep. Soon he was surprised by the strong barking of the dogs. He woke up, and, oh! how scared he was! Fortunately for him, the dogs did not come where he squatted; for their masters drew birds, not rabbits. Bunny thought that the best thing he could do now was to return to his mother, his brothers and sisters as quickly as he could. But it was not so easy to find them."
"For example, John and I sometimes take our books, and we sit on the rocks in the woods, under the thick trees, and read stories. And then Carlo will lie down at our feet, and sleep; for he does not understand the beautiful stories that the other two friends love so much. But wait for us to go to the marshes after the berries, or to the wooden edges after the hazelnuts. So Carlo is great awake, you can be sure. If he sees a snake, what a noise he makes! We can always say by the tone of his bark when he found a snake. And, when John climbs a tree after the hazelnuts, how anxiously Carlo is standing below and looking, so afraid is that the little boy will fall! And how the good dog will jump and show his pleasure when he sees John once again in safety on the firm ground!"
"Billy always looked at the crowd around Dennis, when he was taking his bath, with a lot of anxiety; and, if Dennis did not appear very quickly, he began to bleed loudly. It would disgust Dennis immensely; but he could not bear to think that Billy's feelings were hurt: he would therefore leave his beautiful bath, and push his way through men, until Billy could see him. Then he would go back to the pump, grunting in a way that clearly showed his feelings. He would certainly say: ""I wish the sheep had a little more pigs about him. If I am out of his sight for a while, he begins to cry, and take such a way, that I have to show myself to him; and then I have all the trouble of pumping the sailors."" But the sailors were waiting only to bring Dennis a little bit. They had no idea of not pumping again."
"On a warm and sunny morning, Charlie and Georgie, with their dad and their mamma, and their two boyfriends, rowed across from Appledore, and landed on the pebbly beach of White Island. Here, the children ran, collected stones until they were tired; then the whole party sat on shaded rocks, and ate their lunch with crackers and bananas. As they ate, an old white dog, belonging to the lighthouse keeper, came up and made their acquaintance. Georgie shared his cake with him; and it was fun to see the old dog look impatiently at every piece that went into any mouth, except his. When lunch was over, the two older children, Charlie and Anna, led the way; and soon all climbed up the winding stairs of the lighthouse tower."
"He dreamed of his pleasant home away from Italy. He thought that he was with his little sisters, and saw his dear mother smiling giving him his dinner; but, just as he was going to eat, a sudden noise awakened him. He was afraid to find the light of the day, and that the sun was high in the sky. In the door stood a nice gentleman who was looking at him. Pedro rose up, and took his violin; but the gentleman stopped him while he was going out, and asked him if this pile of shavings was all the bed he had. He spoke so kindly, that Pedro was telling him his story. The gentleman felt so sorry for him, and was so happy with his sweet sad face, that he took him home, and gave him a good hot breakfast; and, being in the absence of a wandering boy, he concluded to let Pedro have the place. Pedro lived happily in his new home since then; and although he still likes to play on his violin, he did not want to go back to his old way of life."
"But a little girl, whose name was Laura, and who was walking with her mother, saw the man remove the nest, and at the same time decided to try to remove it. Then she went up and asked her if he would let her have the nest, if she paid him. The man seemed a little ashamed when he saw Laura and her mother; and he answered, ""Well, little girl, it cost me nothing, and you can have it for nothing."" ""Oh, I thank you always!"" cried Laura. She took the nest, with the birds; and then she and her mother found a safe place in the pit of a tree, hidden from the road, and there they placed it."
"The island of Coney, about eight miles from the city of New York, has a length of four and a half miles and a width of about a mile. It is a summer resort for those who want to breathe the briny air of the ocean. Charles and Laura had long been promised a visit to this famous bathing place, and a warm day in June their father led them to the island; for there is a bridge connecting it to the main land. While they were driving along the beach, they saw the bathers in the water, and Charles was very eager to have a dip in the salt sea himself; but he did not have a swimsuit, and therefore he had to give it. It is very pleasant, on a beautiful summer day, to stand on the beach, and to watch the waves when they come to foam. The children were very amused to see a dog from Newfoundland rushing into the water after a stick that his master would throw away. They will remember for a long time their pleasant visit to the island of Coney; they will take their next time to the island of Coney."
"Dot's father is a funny man. One evening, he brought lemons for the mother, —12 long lemons, fat, yellow, in a bag. Dot was sitting on the piano with the mother when his father came in, and didn't run, as usual, to welcome him with a kiss. Dot's father therefore opened the bag, and let the lemons fall one by one, and roll over the whole floor. Then Dot looked around, and shouted, ""Lemons, lemons! go down; Dot go down! And he ran and picked up the lemons one by one, and put them all together in the big black armchair. When he picked them up, he counted them: ""One, two, three, five, six, seven, nine, ten!"" When Dot got tired of seeing them on the chair, he started putting them on the floor, one at a time, and everything in one place."
"We knew both by her actions that she had a fawn near there; and so, while she was leading Landy away from there, we started to hunt him. In a few minutes, I fell on the little beauty with thin legs, wrapped under a tuft of grass. While I came on him, he threw himself out of the blanket with a small ""baa-baa, baa-baa"", and, as the fawns always do in such cases, began to run in a small circle. Landy, disgusted with his desperate pursuit, came back trotting, and at the same time struck after the fawn. He was not so floating as the other; and by Landy surprised him, and tried to stop him by pushing him with his nose. It scared the fawn so badly, that he did directly for Tip, who had crouched in the long weed waiting, and joyfully rushed into his arms."
"A few weeks passed before Nellie was allowed to take the little man in his arms; but when she had the right to do this, it appeared to her that she had never felt so much pleasure before. When he lifted up his little hands and felt his face, she was ready to cry with joy. But one evening, the nurse was ill; and there was no one to look after the baby. Nellie begged so much to be allowed to sit down and look after him, that she was finally allowed to do so. She spent two hours, looking at the baby as he slept, and thinking about the beautiful moments she would have with him when he grew up. Finally, he woke up; then Nellie gave him milk of porringer, and tried to make him sleep again."
"At the beginning of last spring, Mistress Jenny Wren took possession of the little box nailed to a tree immediately in front of Mr. Philip's house. She had not really moved in, when it was necessary to bow down, but Mr. English-Sparrow. He was abroad hunting home, and never trusted that someone had this house in front of him. He thought how well it would fit him and mate, when whir-r-r! whir-r-r-r! came to Mrs. Jenny: and before he could offer a word of apology, she began with: ""Fie, fie! I thought you were a gentleman! What business do you have here?"" ""My dear lady, started Mr. Sparrow; but Jenny did not hear it."" Outside, you, the sauce, you interlop!"" she cried; and she threw herself at him and pedauled him until he beat a quick retreat."
"Mabel lives on a hill, very close to a beautiful lake, and likes to go with his dad to take a row on the water. Sometimes they visit the woods on the other side of the lake, and pick wild flowers, or go where the water lilies grow, near the shore, and collect a bunch of white flowers. But I have to say about Mabel Carlo's friend. He is a big chamois dog, owned by a gentleman who lives nearby. Although he is quite young dog, he knows a lot of things. He loves the water, and he is wild with pleasure at the prospect of a swim. His master has a big sailboat, and, since the water near the shore is not deep, he has to use a small boat to reach him. When Carlo sees him taking the row of his place in the yard, he climbs up, and takes it in his mouth, as much as to say, ""Let me carry this for you, master."""
"Once, in a battle down in Louisiana, the major began to bark and scold as usual, and to stand up on his hind legs. Then he ran, saying, ""Ki-yi, ki-yi."" He saw a cowardly soldier, who fled; and he grabbed that soldier by his leg, and did not let him go long. He wanted him to go back to fight. Shortly afterwards, the major began to jump in the air, trying to bite the bullets that whistled on his head. When a bullet struck the ground, he ran and tried to dig him up with his legs. Finally, he stood right in front of a line of soldiers on his way, saying, ""Don't come any further!"" He seemed to think that he could bring them back on his own."
"In the field, the old Biddy Brown has four little chickens, few small soft balls, barely bigger than the eggs they came from a week ago. They are very scattered, and run all around. When Mother Biddy finds it a bit pleasant, she grins; and every little chick comes running to see what she misses. When it's cold, and she fears they'll catch cold, she says, ""Cluck, grin, grin!"" and they all run under her hot feathers as fast as they can. Now, Mother Biddy gave a very strong call, and each chicken was under her wings in a minute; and in the sky, I saw a hawk, who had planned to have a good dinner of those same chickens. I couldn't help thinking, how well for them, that they didn't stop, like Lottie, to ask, ""Why?"""
"Once, when Felix was six years old, her mother was taking her to the New York wagons with her. It was a beautiful day in June: the windows of the cars were open. ""Félix,"" said her mother, ""taking a seat, you can sit by the window; but you must not put your head or arms out of the window."" Before she could explain to her why she said this, a friend who had come to her attention, speaking to her; so she forgot to explain to Felix why she did not want him to put his head or arms out of the window. In the seat just before him, Felix saw a big boy, who kept putting his head out of the head, although the boy's mother told her not to do so."
"At the beginning of spring, while the weather is still cold, and before the trees begin to show many signs of life, it is time to type the maples. The sun, which has already begun to make its power feel by melting the snow, and leaving large green spots here and there on the cleared lands, kissed the rugged trunks of the trees, and put the soft sap rising through each vein and tissue. It is now time to put the troughs in order, and to carry the holes for the small beaks through which the juice must run. These must be made a foot from the ground, on the sunny side of the tree; and very soon the drop of water, of the olfactory sap, will be heard, as it passes over the beak in the rough bowls placed to catch it at the foot of each maple."
"When Edward was eight years old, his mother told him that he could go with John, the man hired, to drive the cows out of the pasture. How happy was the little boy! Every day he was ready as soon as John had given the word; and in the distance they went, through the woods, on the hills and the rocks, and climbing streams, wherever the ding-dong of distant cow bells pointed the way. Sometimes they had a long search before they could find all the cows; for the pasture was very large, and the cows wandered in each part of it, to find the best places of food. On the way to the house, Edward ran in front of the cows, and opened the bars; and sometimes he sat on the wall, and paw every cow as she came. When the cows came to the barn, Edward would help the milk. There was an old cow that he called his own, and that he called Carrie. She was always very motionless while she was weary, and that was a reason that he loved everything better."
"Many young sparrows are born for us. They are proud to be American. They think they are smarter than their parents, because their parents, you see, are English. Pride is not fair, is it? There is a bird called the bird butcher, - a very wild bird, - who tries to kill us. We have to watch over these birds butcher-birds. But they cannot enter our houses: the doors are too small for them. There is a small bird called the snowbird, which comes in winter. We are not afraid of him. He is afraid of us. We hunt him when Emily feeds us all. Emily calls us villains when we do this: she threatens to punish us for this. Emily and her people live not far from our grove. Emily has a father and a mother, a grandfather, a brother Philip, and a little sister, whose name is Nelly. Grandpa and Nelly are great friends. Grandpa brings Nelly in her arms to see Emily and Philip feed us."
"One day Bessie was at her aunt's house when the people were gone. But Carlo the dog was at home; and Bessie had her Cornelia doll to play. Finally, she placed Cornelia on the armchair with her arms on her back. Then, seeing near an ink kiosk, and a bottle of gum with a brush in it, Bessie thought that she would have fun painting Carlo's face with ink. It was very stupid, and Carlo seemed to think so; for he struggled, and tried to get out of it. The brush tickled him; he did not like to taste ink: finally he broke himself, and hid himself under the couch. Bessie had a piece of biscuit in her pocket. She took him out, and offered him to Carlo. It was so nice to get a biscuit without having to stand on his back legs first, or to jump a great height, or to do something funny to win him."
"On the easel stood a portrait. Bessie looked at him, and thought it should be a resemblance to his friend Colonel Fraser. ""But, she said, the mustache is too weak: she wants painting."" Then she remembered her uncle saying that he had more work than he could take care of him. ""And if I do a little work for him, and therefore give him a surprise!"" she thought. ""Uncle Frank, when he came by, never let me touch his paintings,"" said Bessie to herself; ""but it must be because he doesn't know how intelligent I am. Nothing can be easier to paint than a mustache. It's only a certain number of hairs."" Then Bessie climbed on his uncle's chair, and took one of his long brushes in his hand."
"Bessie entered the living room one day, and noticed that the clock did not coincide. ""I have to raise it up,"" she thought. ""It must be very easy, because you only have to turn the key around and around."" Then Bessie started turning the key. First she didn't move; then she tried it the other way, and she turned around and turned around quite easily. She was determined to do it thoroughly while she was about her: so she continued to rise and rise, and was charmed to hear her start ticking. But first, she made a noise, — burr-r-r— and then she stopped vibrating."
"All of a sudden, he came into Alan's head that Uncle Paul had been attacked by a wolf, and that they had to have an adventure of the same kind: he asked Owen if he agreed to be eaten by a wolf. Owen said that he did not like: he thought Alan should be eaten, for he was the greatest. Alan said that it would never do so; for then there would be no one to look after him and Amy. But, besides that difficulty, there was another: they had no wolf; and where to find one, they did not know. Finally, it was settled. Owen was to be the wolf, and spring on Amy; but before he ate it, or even as much as he had broken it with his little finger, Alan had to rush on him with his stick, and bring him back into the woods."
"The little mother-in-law, with her blue eyes and her pink cheeks, sat down in the courtyard, surrounded by her animals, and ate apples. From the sky blew the morning wind, and greeted the adorable child: ""Little mother-in-law, I will stay with you; I will spend the time joyfully for you, and refresh your red cheeks. Don't you hear me?"" A sparrow sat before her on the bench, and twitter: ""This is my place; my stomach is empty. Little mother-in-law, I am very hungry. I beg you to give me a breakfast. Don't you hear me?"" The dove was kindled with anger, and said, ""Go away, wandering, begging monk, glutton!"" ""Little mother-in-law, I ask you politely only a sip of water. Don't you hear it?"" The cat sat lost thinking, opening and closing the eyes. ""The little mother-in-law is empty."
"Well, now, do you call these good manners? My master closed the door to my face, as much as to say, ""Stay where you are, Bob."" Then he goes to dinner and play chess with the parson, and leaves me here to look and wait. Three hours, I believe, I was here on the watch,—three long, long hours. And there, he sits there with the people in the summer house. The roasted meat seems to be deliciously made, if I can judge the smell. Just a little bone for me, if you will, good master mine. What do I see? He gives a bone to this camp Fido; but for me, his faithful, who, year after year, have kept the court and so faithfully, - for me he has nothing, not even a mouth! And here I am hungry and thirsty until my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth."
"But Mrs. Vincent, Emma's mother, had been very ill, and Dr. Ware had healed her. One day, while Emma was in the living room with her father and mother, Dr. Ware came. ""I don't need to come back,"" he said, ""I'm here to say well-being. You won't want my medication anymore."" So Emma's dad thanked Dr. Ware for the skill and care he had shown in the case; and Emma's mother said, ""I hope to show you one day how grateful I am, Dr. Ware."" ""What can I do to say how much I thank him?"" thought Emma. ""I'll give her my little marguerite plant,"" she said. So she took him to Dr. Ware; and he was so happy that he took her on his knee and kissed her."
"Well, the children walked and walked, and from time to time they went by car; and on the third morning, Jessie drove Johnny to Boston on the road to Brighton. They found Dr. Williamson. He received them kindly. He examined Johnny's eyes, and then said to Jessie: ""I think there are nine chances in ten that I can heal your brother."" Jessie was happy. The good doctor installed them in his own house while the remedy was in progress; and after a few days he sent the children home in the cars, and, leaving them, placed a sealed envelope in Jessie's hand."
"The pigeons did not at all seem disturbed or frightened by the noise of the people's cars or press; but they flew away, and if he put food in his mouth, they tried to get it even between his teeth. The children gathered together to see it; and even the busy newspaper stopped, and forgot the newspapers under his arm, while he looked at these interviews between the birds and their good friend. A year later, I was again in Boston; but the poor hoof and his birds were not to be seen. All Franklin Street, and a large part of the east side of Washington Street, were in ruins. There had been a great fire in Boston, the largest one ever known there; and more than fifty acres, full of buildings, had been demolished, so that there remained only smoking ruins."
"The boy had a basket attached to his back, and stood in mind, both hands resting on his knees. His name was Norman Blake. Other boys, and a young woman, approached him soon, and joined him as spectators. Norman studied all the movements of the painter's hand; and, when he returned home, he took a piece of charcoal, and tried to draw an image on the wall. Rather, a rough image was, but good enough for a first attempt. The next day, Norman went again, and looked while the painter was drawing. ""You are wrong,"" said Norman all of a sudden, forgetting that the painter had told him not to speak. ""What do you know about this, young wanderer?"" cried the painter with anger."
"There was a good way, and they came soon into the woods. On the edge of the woods was a hut, where the men sometimes rested making sugar. The children thought that they would play what was their house. No one was there that day; they had everything for themselves. A small way out of the woods were two great stakes with a stake through them, on which a large kettle hung. A few half-burned logs and ashes were under the kettle, but the fire was all out. A pile of wood was not far away; and branches of trees, chips, and logs were scattered. The children gathered dry leaves and sticks, and made a fire in a safe place."
"It is an image of the horse that refuses to run on the children. His name is Prince. Once his master led him on a narrow street, when Prince saw a child crawling across the right street in his way. Prince both slows down his speed; and although his master, who did not know that the child was lying in the way, touched him with the whip, Prince knew better than to hurt the poor little child. Finally the good horse stopped short, and refused to move. His master went out of the buggy to see what was the problem; and there, near the forefoot of the horse, was a baby on his knees."
"Madame Starling looks with her little eyes bright and bright, and sees that the troubled sparrows are all gone; and her faithful companion lights up on the upper branch of a tree nearby, and spreads a song of joy and triumph. But soon the wind blows cold from the north. Ah! old winter comes back a moment or two just to see what happens in the spring. The flakes come down on their black coats; and the starlings come out of their little house, and look at the point of seeing what is happening. Have they made a mistake? Oh, no! Soon the sun will be out. April has come, and the snow will not last long. They will first work and clean their little house, throwing away all the waste that the sparrows have left there."
"One night, Hettie went to bed, and forgot to put her animal in her cage. What do you think it did? She flew off on her pillow; and there she sat with her head sewn under her wing. Hettie called her Posey, and called her her daughter. ""What are you going to be, one day, when Posey will lay eggs, and come out with a brood of chickens?"" asked Mom one day. It was a new idea for Hettie; and this intrigued her little brain for a minute; then she laughed: ""Will I be their grandmother?"" Dad rose from her diary to see what had so much fun with her little daughter; and when she had said to her, he had said that he would have a pair of shows ready for her; and Mom said that she would make a hat; and Hettie said that her little chair would be very pleasant for a grandmother."
"Almost every day of the winter, when they can't play outside the doors, these little girls dress up to represent different characters. They call it ""Play paintings"", but their paintings are something more than images, as they act their parts and dress them. Sometimes, for example, one of the little girls appears as a peddler, which is just as hard to get rid of as a real one. Sometimes, a washer enters, and gets on bathtubs and clothes, and makes all the confusion of the day washing. Sometimes, the big chamois black coat of dad covers what claims to be ""your good old Tiger dog"", who is very kind to his friends, but has noisy, fierce ""bow-wows"" and sharp bites for those who aren't good for him. Sometimes, the poor lame little Jimmy, who can only walk on crutches, comes to sell shoe cords, ""because,"" he says, ""you know that I can't do anything else to help my poor mother."""
"George remembered what his uncle had said about Watch that morning.""Now,"" he said to him, ""I'm going to see if I can't get into the house without you knowing it, Master Watch; and if I can't, you're smarter than I think."" George took his shoes, and then flew on the soft grass, like a little thief, until he arrived at the large gravel promenade, which he had to cross to turn towards the back of the house. He stopped for a minute, while he looked at Watch, and soon sent him to lie down at the front door, with his black nose resting on his large white legs; and he seemed to fall asleep quickly."
"One day Mouse managed to open his door and swindle it. Ida wept and wept, and feared that his dear Mouse would die. But after a day or two, as Grandma climbed, she saw the little Mouse jump in front of her. He ran into Ida's closet. Ida brought the cage; and Mom and Grandma had Mouse run in. ""Maybe it's not the same mouse,"" said Grandma. ""Oh, yes,"" said Ida. ""I know him by his painful nose."" Ida took care of Mouse well until the hot weather came, and it was time to go to the country for the summer. Then she took the cage outside the back door and opened the Mouse's door. Mousie was very calm at first; but soon he began to look outside, and, seeing nothing bothered, he fled as quickly as his little legs could carry him."
"Kit Midge was considered in the family as a wonderful little cat. She liked to sit in the sun; she liked to enjoy herself on skinny little mice; and, oh, dear me! from time to time, she liked to catch a bird! It was very naughty, of course; but the best trained cats have their defects. One morning Kit ate her breakfast with a lot of pleasure, washed her face and her legs, softened her fur coat, and went to the living room to take a nap in the large armchair. The sun shone full in her face; and she shone and could and felt very good; for, only the night before, she had caught her first rat, and for such a valiant action had been rented and kneaded to her heart. Well, Kit Midge fell asleep in the chair, with a small pink ear turned back, so that she could easily wake up, and a black cock wrapped around her legs."
"The most important bee in the hive is naturally the queen. It is longer and softer than the others, and it has a twisted bite, of which, however, it rarely makes use. Similar in form, but smaller, are the working bees, whose sting is straight. The male bee, or drone, is thicker than the others, and stinging. ""What does the queen have to do in the hive?"" I asked. The old gentleman replied, ""It is the mother bee, lay all the eggs, and is so diligent that she often lays twelve cents a day, having a separate cell for each egg. It is her only job; for she leaves all the care of her children to the working bees, who have various tasks to do. Some build wax cells; others bring honey on the flower dust, called pollen; others feed and take care of the young; and a small number act as bodyguard to the queen."""
"When he was six months old, he became very malicious, and no one could stop missing from the house. Handkerchiefs, slippers, shoes, towels, aprons and towels disappeared; and no one could say what became of them. One day, Cæsar was seen entering the garden with a slipper in his mouth; and I followed him to a far corner where there was a large basket. I looked under the bush and saw Cæsar dig a hole, in which he put the slipper, and then covered it with earth. I dug under that bush, and found everything that had been missed. A dog of the neighbour, called ""Dr. Wiseman"", was Cæsar's private friend. One day, we heard a great scratch at the front door; and, when we opened it, in a cæsar and Dr. Wiseman walked. Cæsar took the doctor by the ear, and brought him to each of his family, as he did, and brought him into the garden."
"""Tick, tick! tick, tick!"" said the old clock again; and then there was a little noise, and the old clock began to knock; and at the same time a small door on the dial plate opened, and there was a little bird shouting, ""Cuckoo, cuckoo!"" And on the bird, on the top of the clock, a little man started in a red coat, with a saber and a full musket, and started walking backwards and forwards. Henry did not look up to see the bird and the little man; for he wanted to be in the garden playing with his sister, instead of trying to write a theme on the ""Flight of Time."" Finally Henry finished his theme in these words: ""Time doesn't fly at all fast for me when I try to write a theme. On the contrary, it seems very long. We should improve our time."
"""Why, Walter, what a threat!"" said Laura laughing; ""but you are a good thing like the dog of Minister Bunkum, who barks terribly, but never bites.""""Look what I get to be a good boy!"" replied Walter. ""The first time there was a chance of having fun, so it was: ""O Walter! you and the other boys are too young to have confidence in themselves on the water."" Walter had made it difficult to hear these words when there were screams from the edge of the road nearby; and men and women were seen running towards the pond. What could be the problem? We quickly made known what there was. The little people in the boat had upset him; and five of them were wilting in the water. Fortunately, no life was lost."
"There were two little boys who were cousins. One was called Richard; the other was called Paul. Richard lived where he could see from his bedroom window the Atlantic Ocean. There was a thick pile of trees at the back of his house; and in winter, the ground in front was often covered with snow. Paul lived in southern California, where, from his bedroom window, he could see the Pacific Ocean. He had a brother Harry and two sisters. He never had snow where he was: and he did not need skates; for the water had never frozen. Richard had a sister Mary, whose affection he had. Richard wrote to his cousin Paul about his way of spending Christmas morning:— ""I would like Harry and the girls to have been with us; for we had a good time on the ice. I will tell you what we did."
"""This poor woman looks sad and discouraged,"" said Ellen herself: ""She must be almost as sad as I am. How can I comfort her? Why, by buying some of her shoes, of course."" Ellen had a little money of her own put in a box. She ran and got it, and then, putting on her hood, went out and bought a whole bunch of shoes. Then, with the consent of her aunt, she asked the poor woman to come in and have a lunch. The poor woman gladly accepted the invitation; and Ellen soon sat her down by a beautiful fire in the kitchen, chatting and laughing with the good ones as if she had no concern in the world. ""Did I make you happy?"" asked Ellen. ""That you have, dear,"" said the poor woman, with a tear in the eyes."
"It was discovered that the cow had been mistreated by the man who had possessed her, and who had been accustomed to milking her. Being a beast of high mind, she then gave her so much trouble, that he was soon happy to be rid of her. She would not let anyone touch her any more than Mabel: so Mr. Brittan finally said that the cow should be Mabel's cow, and that all the butter that the cow had given should be her. But Mabel is a generous daughter; and therefore she shares the money that she earns. Her mother, sister Emily, and her brothers Oliver and Frank, all get a part of it. Mabel gave a name to the cow; and the cow will come to her when she calls her name. The name is very pretty for a cow, I think. It's Dido."
"Sometimes we say to him, ""Now, Pinny, play sick."" Then he goes to bed, sinks his head, and puts an unhappy look. We run around him, saying, ""Poor Pinny!"" and he seems to appreciate the joke all the time. As soon as we say, ""On Pinny, all right,"" he jumps, shakes, and gives a conscious look, which seems to say, ""Did I not do well?"" When we tell him to beg, he sits on his studs, lifts up his forefathers, and whine softly. When we hear a noise, and say, ""See if someone comes, Pinny!"" he goes to the door, and listen: if someone comes, he barks out loud; otherwise, he returns quietly. Sometimes, the two dogs play on horseback. Their master takes a few feet long, and fastens a bit around Pinny's neck, and the other around Tip's."
"Albert was in great joy, but it was a long walk, and the little boy was very happy when they came in view of the sparkling waters of Neosho, just as the sun was lying down. Dad had just time to lay down a tent and build a great fire before it was dark enough. Then they all sat by the fire and ate their supper. Then Mom made a beautiful bed with blankets and shawls, and put Albert there. They were all happy to go to bed early. The wolves barked them several times during the night, but were too afraid of the fire to venture very close. Albert slept as slowly as if he had been in his own little bed at home, instead of being outside under the starry sky, far from a house."
"Maud spends her holidays in the woods and mountains of Maine, where she went with her father and mother about two weeks ago. A very pleasant morning dad said, ""I think it's better to go around this morning."" Maud was called to prepare; and Hannah, the good white horse, was tied up in the buggy. The buggy had only one seat: then mom found a beautiful box, and folded her shawl and put it; and this made a good place for the little girl, between her father and her mother; and they all started on their way. They went along a shady road by the river, and soon they saw a few geese. Several of them were swimming in the water, and one or two were on the shore. One of them had a kind of frame around her neck, and stood on a leg."
"This year, on the day of Thanksgiving, none of our friends were with us; and Mom and Dad felt very sad to have the great turkey cooked, and only our own family to eat it. Thus, seeing a young boy raced in the street, Mom called him, and told him to go out and find eleven other poor little boys, and told them to come with him and have a Thanksgiving dinner. He fled in high joy; and, of course, when twelve hours came, they came all the number of poor and hungry little boys. Their eyes shone with joy when they saw the beautiful brown turkey, and the pies and cakes. They sat down at the table soon; and Dad and Mom waited for them. It made us all happy to see how the poor people enjoyed their dinner."
"It was a day of wind in November. The waves broke with a great noise on the shingle beach. Soon the wind rose higher; the sea also rose, and the rain fell quickly. The children returned to the village, and there the old men said, shaking their heads, ""We will have a storm."" That night, all the boats returned safely to the port, except the boat in which Rachel's grandfather had sailed. It was a long and sad night for poor Rachel. The next day and the next passed; and no grandfather returned to look after her, and found her in food and clothing, and brought her into her strong arms when she was tired of walking. Susan and Joe, in their own house, felt sad for the little orphan. One day, their mother went to the market."
"Willy likes to play horse, but doesn't have a brother to play with him. Her three-year-old sister Edith doesn't like to play horse: she prefers to be with her dolls. Sometimes Willy crosses and rumbles at her because she won't play as much horse as he wants. A few days ago, I saw Willy riding from the cellar with a big red apple in her hand; and soon after I heard the two children running in the rooms, having a happy time; and Willy called, ""O Mom! I gave an apple, and she played horse."" See, he had thought about this story, and decided to try to coax little sister, as the man did the horse: he soon found that the kind words and deeds were better than the claws. I hope he won't forget it very soon."
"When Willy was two years old, he lived in a red farm with a courtyard in front of her. The dandelions were very thick there, so that the court looked yellow instead of green. On a bright morning, Willy's mother put her straw hat on, and sent her out into the courtyard to play. She knew that the court had a high fence; and he could not open the door; so he was safe. When it was time for him to take a nap, and mom was going to call her, she noticed that a large amount of dandelions had gone. She wondered where they were; but, as Willy could not speak much about them, she did not ask him about them. Shortly afterwards, while Willy was sleeping in his crèche, his mother went out to draw water. When the bucket had been up full of water, the top was all yellow with dandelions."
"Mamma shook her head, even if she could not help laughing at the girl's mistake, because she meant subscribers. It's a hard word; but this little Grandma knew the meaning. ""O Mom! please do; for you know that I love her. And Jennie and Katie and Bessie will also love, if only they know about it; and, moreover, I can get a gift, if I send new names to the nanny's man."" Little Grandma was so urgent in her request, that her mother asked Dad what he thought about it. Dad said, ""Oh, let her try if she wants: it won't hurt."" How black eyes dance! and the little feet could barely stay still, while Mamma dressed her very warmly, until she was about as big as the other."
"It was a fox. How he ran when he saw us! We ran after him, and we chased him in a pile of rails, in a corner of the camp. You see, the soldiers had ripped out all the fences, and they piled them up for firewood. The fox ran straight into the middle of the rails; and the more he tried to get out, the more he could not. ""A fox, a fox!"" we shouted; we heard that all men, like so many boys, rushed, and formed themselves in circle around the pilewood, so that the poor fox was completely encircled. So some of us went to work, and removed the rails one by one, until it was finally clear, and we could all see it."
"It was Saturday afternoon, a week ago. He was on the coast with the other boys. Johnny Ware, a little boy of only five years old, was with them. Harry and several other boys went very fast down the hill as Johnny climbed. ""Get out of the way!"" shouted a boy. ""Look, Johnny, turn right!"" cried another. But the little boy did not know what was right, and, being puzzled, stood still. The sleds were almost on him, and it seemed that he had to be crushed, when Harry caught him, and threw him on one side, but not in season to save his own ankle. He was badly sprained, and he had to be carried home."
"Annie and her younger brother went up with their dad and mom. They crossed the river on a long bridge; and beyond, they saw horses and cows feeding on the green meadow. ""What are all these piles of land for?"" said Annie. ""We're just entering the city of dogs,"" said her dad; ""and these are the houses of the inhabitants. Do you see the two little guys sitting on this mound?"" ""Yes,"" said Annie; ""but they look like small fatty squirrels; don't do it, Mom?"" Baby pointed her little chubby finger, and said, ""Is!"" ""They're prairie dogs,"" said mom; ""but they're sometimes called the wood marmot and the meadow marmot,"" and sometimes ""the meadow marmot."""
"Mr. Werner has a monkey and a pet dog. The monkey is called Captain. He wears a hat with a feather in it. The name of the pet dog is Grip. He is fat and greedy; and, if he sees a boy with a cake, he begs a piece of it; indeed, he would not oppose it all. I wonder if you can spy on Grip and the captain in the photo. But Dandy does more fun for us than all the others. ""Now, Dandy,"" Mr. Werner will say, ""make your most amazing bow to the ladies, and then give us a turn on the fantastic light."" By the ""fantastic light,"" Mr. Werner means ""the fantastic light toe."" He made this joke so many times, that we know what he wants to say by it. Thus encouraged, Dandy will bow, rise on one of his back feet, and swirl in a pirouette. (If you don't know what a pirouette is, you need to have one to explain and say the word.)"
"On a beautiful Monday morning, I looked out of the front window, and I said, ""Why, Harry, Uncle David has come into town! He binds his horse under the abalone."" A moment later, Uncle David opened the door in the living room, and said, ""Is there anyone here who would like to go to Grandfather's house today?"" And mom said, ""We would all like to go. It will do my little boys good to have a nice walk."" ""Prepare yourself, then,"" said Uncle David. ""If Mom put a little blue coat and a white cap on Freddy the baby, and a linen coat, and a straw hat with blue ribbons on Harry; and they all went out, and got into the car. Then they went through the pretty streets, and on a covered bridge, where the horse went trot, trot, trot. Then they crossed a railway track, and passed a station, and stopped in a store; and Uncle David went and bought a big box of sugar for his little boy."
"In a day or two, we began to look at the world. We discovered that it included a pretty lawn, on which our house was placed, with a brick wall at one end of it. The other end of the world was at the foot of the lawn, and was composed of a level spread as smooth as a sheet of glass. Our house was made of wood, with a pointed high roof, and with open bars in front, through which we could look out and enjoy the perspective. We could crawl under the bars easily; but mother-hen could not. One day, a great giant, strong came and raised our house just above our heads. This giant had two legs, but no wings."
"Poor John ate his bread with water instead of milk: but in a way he was not unhappy, for he felt that he had done a kindness to little Sam Jones; and the satisfaction of having done a service to another always brings happiness. A few days later, Mr. Jones came to school, and he spoke to Mr. Brill about the matter; for little Sam had told his father and his mother everything. Sam was a shy boy; but he could not stand seeing John Tubbs kept without fault, while the other boys were at stake."
"One day, a wandering dog came to the house, and John gave him a part of his dinner. The dog appreciated so much the attention that he remained near the house, and would not be driven out. Every day John gave him what he could spare. One day, John said to him, ""Doggie, what is your name? Is it Fido? Is it Frisk? Is it Nero? Is it Nap? Is it Tiger? Is it Toby? Is it Plato? Is it Pomp? When John spoke the word ""Pomp"", the dog began to bark; and John said, ""Well, sir, then your name will be Pomp."" Then John began to play with him, and found that Pomp did not only know many things, but that he was quick to learn new things."
"William was not afraid of being laughed, and he felt very obliged to those who had made mistakes in what he was doing. He was not discouraged by chess. He continued to try until he had used his pencil almost all up. Yet, he had not yet made a good drawing of a horse. ""You will never learn to draw: so you can give it first as well as the last one,"" said his friend one day, about six months after their last meeting. ""Your horses are still donkeys."" William opened a portfolio, and, taking some pictures, said, ""What do you think of them?"" Ah! Here's something like a horse, ""Looking at one of the drawings,"" said his friend. ""You will never do anything like that, Willy."" William smiled, but said nothing; although it was his own drawing that his friend rented."
"Rudolf, the eldest, learned to be a carpenter; but when he was twenty-one years old, he entered into the possession of a great fortune. He married, and thought that he had so much money that he could not spend everything. But before the age of fifty, all his great possessions had melted. Some of his majestic houses had been burned down, and the insurance offices had failed. Some of the men whom he had trusted had proved dishonest; and many of the projects which he had undertaken had gone wrong. At the age of forty-six, Rudolf Reinhold took the business of a carpenter whom he had learned between fourteen and eighteen years old. He soon became skilled, and turned to the construction of houses in the city of Berlin."
"Rachel has been used to a life in the city, but she is now visiting her uncle's house in the countryside, and she has good times crawling in the woods and fields. Her cousin Paul takes her to pick berries, and tells her the name of the things she sees. ""The smell of these leaves,"" Paul will say, breaking a twig of a shrub, a bit like a hoular, and crushing the leaves in her hand. ""It's the berries shrub. How fragrant the leaves are! He wears a bay with a grey wax coating; and in Nova Scotia this wax is widely used instead of a tallow, or mixed with tallow, to make candles."" ""But what is this little red bay on the floor?"" Rachel once asked when they were on one of their rambles."
"""Why, cousin,"" said Rodney, ""you must know that the tides are the rise and fall of the waters of the ocean. There will be a high tide in an hour; then the water will cover all those rocks that you see around us. After that, the water will flow and return until we can see the rocks again, and walk a long way on the sand; then there will be a low tide. But we must not stay here to talk: the water will soon be too deep for us."" Rodney took Rose in his arms, and Julia placed his left hand on his right shoulder; and in this way they crossed the water at the dry part of the beach."
"Walter Dane was in a hurry to go play ball with some of his schoolmates, so he didn't think much about the lesson he needed to learn. It was a grammar lesson. Walter's mother took the book, and said, ""I'm afraid my little boy finds it hard to put his thoughts on his lesson today."" ""Try me, mother,"" said Walter. ""I'll do my best."" ""Then I'm going to ask you a question that's not in the book,"" said Mom. ""Who's the heaviest, a book of feathers, or a book of lead?"" ""A book of lead, to be sure!"" cried Walter with confidence. ""There you spoke then without thinking,"" said Dane. ""A little thought would have made you understand that a book is a book, and that a book of feathers must weigh as much as a lead book."""
"Have you ever heard of the boy who had a drum, a trumpet, and a rocking horse for his Christmas presents, and wept, after all, because Santa Claus had given his sister a doll, and had not given her one? I heard about this boy; but, to tell the truth, I doubt the whole story. It's a little too hard for me. I don't think there was ever such a boy; and I won't believe in him until I saw him. But I knew a little boy who almost cried because he didn't have a Christmas gift. He was also a good boy. He would have been happy with something; and it was a shame that Santa forgot to bring him a little gift. The strangest case, however, is that of the little boy whose image we have. You see him as he looked at Christmas morning, with his gifts all around him; and yet you see that he doesn't look happy."
"""Now is the time to choose the cherries!"" cried Charles when entering the garden one afternoon in July. ""Are they ripe?"" said his mother. ""Ripe? I should think so. Look at them!"" Charles, pointing at the trees. ""O Mom!"" said Mary, ""The birds get them all. We must have them picked right away."" ""Never fear, little girl,"" said his mother. ""There will be enough for the birds, us and our neighbours too. But it is really time to start choosing them. So Charles, take a basket, and we will all go out under the cherry tree."" Then they all left: Charles and Mary and Ellen and Julia and Ruth; and mother followed with the baby. ""I told the gardener to bring a ladder,"" said mom. ""He will be here in a moment, Charles. You cannot pick cherries without a scale, you know."""
"I had finished eating my dinner, put my bucket under a pile of trees, and started my afternoon work; but, as the stake was large and hard, I often had to stop and rest for a minute. While I was standing, with my hands on a handful of the saw, at the same time a bird was flying towards me; and, after resting on the ground behind the stake for a few moments, what do you suppose he did? If he knew I was tired, and thought it was too hard for me to cut the wood alone, I can't say; but suddenly he gave a little spring, and sat right on the other handle of my saw, as you see in the picture, grab it with all the hands he had, and look as if he had come to help me see that stake through."
"One day, when I was in the stable, I looked up, and there, on a beam, I saw a red squirrel with a large bushy tail. He looked at me straight. The next day, I saw him in my yard, trying to jump from one tree to the other. I thought he would fall; but he just saved himself by catching the end of a twig. In one of the rooms, there was an old satchel hanging on a nail. Bunny went up to the window, and filled the satchel with nuts and apple seeds. There was a basket of corn in the wood house; and Bunny took away almost everything. One day, as Bunny passed through the grass, he heard a noise: he sat down, and looked at it. He saw a dog. He went up Bunny in a tree. The dog came under the tree, and barked. The squirrel ran, and said with his eyes, ""Maintening to make up a tree."" So, if you can catch it, you can catch it."
"She couldn't sit down. She saw the little white chickens running in the grass, and she thought she was trying to catch one. So she squatted, and without making a bit of noise, was getting ready for a source. But the chickens had a dear mother who loved them. When she saw Kitty crawling along, she knew they were in danger: so she flew to Kitty, and made a terrible sound that scared her. Then Kitty saw a big butterfly flying in the air. By and there, she flew on a flower. Kitty fled and caught her in her mouth. Then she saw a pretty bird on a bush, singing as hard as he could. Kitty jumped under the bush, like a little rogue. But the bird saw her coming, and flew away. One day, a bee came in with honey. Kitty saw the bee, and caught it in her mouth. I think she wouldn't try to be any more."
"Edwin has two doves. They were given to him by his uncle. He has a beautiful little house for them. There are two doors where they come in and out. In front of the doors, there is a shelf on which they perch. The doves are free to go wherever they want; but they always come home at night. They are quite tamed. Sometimes they fly to Edwin's window, and the light on the threshold. They tap on the glass to let him know that they are hungry. Then, he opens the window, and feeds them. He gives them corn, bread crumbs, and sometimes oats. They love corn better. One of them is more likely to be greedy; and both have so much to eat that they are very plumbed and fat. Here are the doves that look at turkeys. They don't know what to do with such birds."
"The speckled hen walked all around the house, and saw the door open. So she entered, and went up the stairs. She went into the front bedroom, stooped a little on the carpet, and suffocated when she saw herself in the mirror. She saw a waterfowl standing on the top of the desk. She thought it would make a nice place for a nest. Then she flew away to see; but the bowl bowed down and fell on the ground. When people went up the stairs to see what was happening, they found that the waterfowl was in pieces, and the hen had made its nest in the box of the band in the corner of the room. They thought it was a very pleasant thing for a hen; but they didn't drive it: they waited for what she was going to do next."
"A balloon went up from Boston Common, and two children were on a hill in the country looking at it. ""That's it!"" said Willy, as he was pointing at a black spot over the state house. The spot seemed to be growing at every moment. ""The ball comes in this way,"" said Willy. ""I can see a man waving a flag."" By and there he seemed to go down on a hill near the place where the children were standing. They were running to meet him, shouting while they were going; but it was much further than they thought. Many other people were looking at the ball at the same time; and he was going down to a pasture where children were picking up berries. When he was almost down, the man looked outside and said, ""Have you got some blueberries to sell?"" The children held their baskets, and said, ""Yes, many of them."" ""Well,"" said the man, ""I think it's a good place to stop."
"When there is an inherited or instinctive tendency to perform an action, or a taste inherited from certain types of food, a certain habit in the individual is often or generally necessary. We find this in the horse's rhythms, and to some extent in the scoring of dogs; although some young dogs point out excellently the first time they are removed, but they often associate the appropriate inherited attitude with a bad smell, and even with sight. I have heard that if a calf can only suck its mother once, it is much more difficult afterward to raise it by hand. The caterpillars that have been fed on the leaves of a kind of tree, have been known to perish from hunger rather than eat the leaves of another tree, although this has allowed them their proper food, in a state of nature; and so in many other cases."
"The power of the Association is recognized by everyone. Mr. Bain notes that ""the actions, sensations and feelings, occurring together or in close succession, tend to grow together, or to coexist, so that when one of them is presented subsequently to the mind, the others are likely to be raised in idea."" It is so important for our purpose to fully recognize that actions become easily associated with other actions and various states of mind, that I will give a lot of cases, first concerning man, and then the lower animals. Some cases are of a very trifling nature, but they are as good for our purpose as more important habits. It is known to everyone how difficult, if not impossible, without repeated testing, to move members in certain opposite directions that have never been practiced. Analogous cases occur with sensations, as in the common experience of rolling a marble under the ends of two crossed fingers, when it feels exactly like two marbles."
"It was a sweet summer evening, and my father asked me, as he had sometimes done, to take a little ramble with him along this beautiful forest that I mentioned as lying in front of the schloss. ""General Spielsdorf cannot come to us as quickly as I had hoped,"" said my father, as we continued our walk. He had to have visited us for a few weeks, and we expected him to arrive the next day. He must have brought with him a young lady, his niece and her pupil, Mademoiselle Rheinfeldt, whom I had never seen, but whom I had heard describe as a very charming girl, and in whose society I promised myself many happy days."
"As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian from Paris. As he had abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he had in vain sought a master according to his own heart. Passepartout was in no way one of those perts represented by Molière with a bold look and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest man, with a pleasant face, lips a salient, soft and helpful trifle, with a good round head, as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. His eyes were blue, his ruby complexion, his almost door-like and well-built figure, his muscular body, and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his youngest days. His brown hair was a little stuffed; for, while the ancient sculptors were supposed to have known eighteen methods of organizing the braid of Minerva, Passepartout was only familiar with one single dress himself: three strokes of a large toothed comb completed his toilet."
"One summer, Aksionov went to the Nijni fair, and, saying goodbye to his family, his wife said to him, ""Ivan Dmitrich, do not start today; I had a bad dream about you."" Aksionov laughed, and said, ""You are afraid that when I am at the fair I will make a spree."" His wife replied, ""I don't know what I am afraid of; all I know is that I had a bad dream. I dreamed that you were coming back from the city, and when you took off your hat, I saw that your hair was very gray."" Aksionov laughed. ""It's a sign of luck,"" he said."
"There are strange friendships. The two friends are always ready to steal one another, and to continue like this all their lives, and yet they cannot separate. To leave, in fact, is quite impossible. Whoever started the quarrel and separated will be the first to fall ill and even die, perhaps, if the separation comes. I know for a positive fact that several times Stepan Trofimovich jumped from the couch and beat the wall with his fists after the most intimate and emotional head-to-head with Varvara Petrovna. This procedure was by no means an empty symbol; indeed, once he broke a bit of plaster from the wall. One can wonder how I came to know such delicate details."
"Thieves are not good solo singers, but their choir, like primitive fire lovers, greet the return of light and warmth to the world, is unrivalled. There are a hundred songs like one. They are loud enough then, and sing, as poets should, without thinking. But when they come after cherries to the tree near my window, they beat their voices, and their pip weak, pip, pop! sounds far down the garden, where they know that I will not suspect them to steal the big black nut from his bitter rinsed shop. They are feathered Pecksniffs, to be sure, but then how brilliant their breasts, which look rather abominable in the sun, shine in a rainy day against the dark green of the fringe tree! After they have punctured and shaken all the life of a earthworm, as the Italian cooks beat all the spirit out of a steak, and the gossip is formed with a clean eye, they set themselves up with a clean air."
"Her mother has insinuated that her temperament is inextricable, but I have never seen a face less revealing of any evil disposition than her; and of what I can see from each one's behavior to the other, from the invariable severity of Lady Susan and from Frederica's silence, I am led to believe as before that the first one does not really have love for his daughter, and has never done justice or treated with affection. I could not have a conversation with my niece; she is shy, and I think I can see that some pains are taken to prevent her from being much with me. Nothing satisfactory is apparent as to her reason to flee."
"There, sitting on the edge stone, Jonathan Tinker, being delivered with some first questions, told in a few tips and torn the story of his hard life, which was at the moment that of a second companion, and had been that of a cabin boy and a sailor before the mast. The place of the second companion was the most difficult on board the ship. You got only a few dollars more than the men, and you did not tidy with the officers; you took your meals alone, and in all that you owned by yourself. The men did not respect you, and sometimes the captain abused you terribly in front of the passengers. The hardest captain with whom Jonathan Tinker ever sailed was Captain Gooding of Cape Town. It had happened that no man could ship second companion under Captain Gooding; and Jonathan Tinker was with him only a journey."
"I believe very well in reading classes, because I think I have a book leads to another. But, after the beginning, these courses for different people will vary a lot from one another. You all go to a great picnic, and you gather in a nice place in the woods, and you put the baskets there, and leave the bucket with the ice in the shadiest place you can find, and cover it with the cover. Then, you all went to this great forest, which we call Literature. But it's only a few of the parties, who choose to start hand in hand along a gravel road there, which leads directly to the well of the Burgesses, and probably those ones enjoy less and earn less from the excursion of the day than one of the others. The rest breaks down into different knots, and go here and some there, as their opportunity and their genius call them."
"Meanwhile, we went to Sidney, Delaware County, where my father opened a shop. I continued to work with him, and during our stay in Sidney, my daughter, Elizabeth, was born. From Sidney, my father wanted to go to Bainbridge, Chenango County, N.Y., and I went with him, leaving my wife and children in Sidney, while we were prospecting. As usual my father started a blacksmith's shop; but I bought a hundred acres of wood, I went to wood, and I made money. We had a house about four miles from the village, I lived with my father, and as soon as I found out we were going into business, I sent to Sidney for my wife and children. They had to come by scene, and they were due, after crossing Bainbridge, to our house at four o'clock in the morning."
"It is important to remember that, in rigour, there is not a thing like a man without instruction. Take an extreme case. Suppose that an adult man, in the vigour of his faculties, can suddenly be placed in the world, as Adam is said to have been, then left to do as he would do best. How long would he be left without instruction? Not five minutes. Nature would begin to teach him, through the eye, the ear, the touch, the properties of the objects. Pain and pleasure would be at his elbow telling him to do this and to avoid that; and to a slow degree man would receive an education, which, so narrow, would be complete, real, and suitable for his circumstances, although there would be no extras and very few achievements. And if to this lonely man entered into a second Adam, or, better yet, an Eve, a new and larger world, that of social and moral phenomena, would be revealed."
"By the end of November, during a thaw, at nine o'clock a morning, a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway approached the latter city at full speed. The morning was so wet and foggy that it was only very difficult for the day to break; and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few meters from the windows of the car. Some passengers of this particular train returned from abroad; but the third-class cars were best filled, mainly with insignificant persons of various trades and degrees, picked up at the various stations closer to the city. All seemed weary, and most of them had sleepy eyes and a trembling expression, while their shades generally seemed to have taken the color of the fog outside."
"At the call of the master, two crew members of the ship came to help us dress in these heavy and waterproof clothes, made of seamless rubber and built specifically to withstand considerable pressure. This diver could have been taken for a suit of armor, soft and resistant. He formed a trousers and a vest; the pants were finished with thick boots, weighted by heavy lead soles. The texture of the vest was held together by copper bands, which crossed the chest, protecting it from the great pressure of the water and leaving the lungs free to act. The sleeves ended with gloves, which in no way retained the movement of the hands. There was a great difference between this dress and the former dive suit. Captain Nemo and one of his companions, Conseil and I, were quickly wrapped in the dresses; there was nothing left to do, but we held our heads in the metal boxes."
"The horse was brought to the door. Now he had not climbed for a good while; and, although the little boys were there to help him, he had a lot of trouble getting on the horse. He tried a lot of times, but he always found himself facing the wrong way, looking at the tail of the horse. They turned the head of the horse, first up the street, then down the street; he didn't make a difference; he always made a mistake, and found himself sitting in the wrong way. ""Well,"" he said, ""I don't know how I care about it. If the horse has the head in the right direction, it's the main thing. Sometimes I get in that way in the cars, because I like it better. I can turn my head quite easily, to see where we are going."" Then he left, and the little boys said that he looked like a circus-rideau, and they were very happy."
"Sire was once a merchant who had great wealth, in the land and the merchandise, as well as in the ready money. He was obliged from time to time to take trips to arrange his things. One day, having to go away from home, he went up his horse, taking with him a small wallet in which he had put some biscuits and dates, because he had to go through the desert where he was not to have food. He arrived without any misfortune, and having finished his business, went on his return. On the fourth day of his journey, the heat of the sun being very great, he turned away from his way to rest under a few trees. He found at the foot of a great drown a fountain of clear and running water. He disassembled, threw his horse to a branch of the tree, and sat by the fountain, after taking from his wallet some of his dates and biscuits."
"But he did not hear anything, and therefore, judging by the impression of the seal and the lid, he thought that there should be something precious inside. To discover it, he took his knife and, with a little trouble, opened it. He turned it upside down, but nothing came out, which was a great surprise to him. He put it in front of him, and as he looked closely at him, a smoke so thick that he had to go back one step or two. This smoke rose up towards the clouds, and spread over the sea and the shore, forming a thick mist, which caused much astonishment to the fisherman. When all the smoke came out of the jar, it came together, and became a thick mass in which a genius appeared, twice as great as the greatest giant. When he saw such a terrible monster, the fisherman would have wanted to flee, but he trembled so hard that he could not move a step."
"In these terms, I was informed that my personal concern was about the diamond issue. If you are curious about what course I took in the circumstances, I would like to inform you that I did what you would probably have done in my place. I modestly stated myself completely unrivalled in relation to the task imposed on me – and I felt in private, all the time, that I was smart enough to execute it, if I had only given my own abilities a fair chance. Mr. Franklin, I imagine, had to see my personal feelings in my face. He refused to believe in my modesty; and he insisted on giving my abilities a fair chance. Two hours have passed since Mr. Franklin left me. As soon as his back was turned, I went to my writing office to start the story."
"The historical truth must not be less sacred than religion. If the precepts of faith raise our soul above the interests of this world, the lessons of history, in turn, inspire us with the love of the beautiful and the just, and the hatred of all that constitutes an obstacle to the progress of humanity. These lessons, in order to be profitable, require certain conditions. It is necessary that the facts be produced with exact rigour, that political or social changes be analyzed philosophically, that the exciting interest in the details of the life of public men does not distract the attention of the political part they have played, or make us forget their providential mission. Too often the writer represents the different phases of history as spontaneous events, without seeking in the previous facts their true origin and their natural deduction; as the painter who, by reproducing the characteristics of Nature, does not grasp their picturesque effect, without power, in his photograph, giving their scientific demonstration. The historian should be more than a painter; he should, like the geologist, who explains the phenomena of the globe, deploy the secret of the transformation of societies."
"The Romans, by protecting the people of Marseilles, had spread their domination on the coast; by signing other alliances, they entered into the interior. The Ædui were at war with the Allobroges and the Arverni. The proconsul Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus joined the first, and defeated the Allobroges, in 633, in Vindadium, on the Sorgue (Sulgas), not far from the Rhône. Later, Q. Fabius Maximus, grandson of Paulus Æmilius, obtained, at the confluence of the Isère and the Rhône, a decisive victory over the Allobroges, and over the Bituites, king of the Arverni. By this success, Q. Fabius obtained the name of Allobrogicus. The Arverni claimed to be descendants of the Trojans, and boasted a common origin to the Romans; they remained independent, but their domination, which extended from the banks of the Rhine to the vicinity of Narbonne and Marseilles, they were submissed."
"Raskolnikov was not used to the crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided any kind of society, especially late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with others. Something new seemed to happen in him, and with him he felt a kind of thirst for company. He was so tired after a month of concentrated misery and dark excitement that he wanted to rest, if only for a moment, in another world, whatever; and, despite the dirt of the surrounding area, he was happy to stay in the tavern. The master of the establishment was in another room, but he often went down a few steps into the main room, his boots yellowed and tarred with red roofs that came every time before the rest of his person."
"In 1803 Jefferson, then president of the United States, proposed to Congress to send an exploration group to trace the Missouri at its source; to cross the highlands and follow the best water communication that could be offered to the Pacific Ocean. Congress approved the proposal, and voted for a sum of money to execute it. Capt Lewis, who had then been two years with Mr. Jefferson as private secretary, immediately renewed his requests for direction of the expedition. Mr. Jefferson had now had the opportunity to know him intimately, and believed him courageous, persevering, familiar with American Aboriginal character and customs, accustomed to hunting, honest, and good judgment."
"The figures of this boat were those of a strong man with grizzly hair and a face burned with sun, and of a black girl of nineteen or twenty, similar enough to him to be recognizable as his daughter. The girl rowed, pulling a pair of stubble very easily; the man, with the loose rudder lines in his hands, and his loose hands in his belt, kept a greedy look. He had no net, hook, or line, and he could not be a fisherman; his boat had no cushion for a babysitter, no paint, no inscription, no device beyond a rusty boat and a coil of rope, and he could not be a man of water; his boat was too crazy and too small to take charge of delivery, and he could not be a lighter or a river carter; he had no idea of what he was looking for, but he was looking for something, with the most intent and search eye."
"There was a table placed under a tree in front of the house, and the Hare de Mars and the Hatter had tea there: a Dormouse was sitting between them, asleep, and the other two used it as a cushion, resting their elbows on her, and speaking on her head. ""Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,"" thought Alice; ""only, as she is asleep, I guess it didn't bother."" The table was a big one, but the three were all crowded at a corner of it: ""No place! No place!"" they cried when they saw Alice coming. ""There was a lot of room!"" said Alice, outrageously, and she sat in a large armchair at one end of the table. ""Your hair want to cut,"" said the Hatter. ""He looked Alice for some time with great curiosity, and that was his first speech. ""You should learn not to make personal remarks,"" said Alice with some severity."
"Either the well was very deep, or it fell very slowly, because it had a lot of time to go down to look around it, and to wonder what would happen next. First, she tried to look down and do what she was coming, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with closets and shelves: here and there she saw maps and images hanging on pimples. She took a pot in one of the shelves she passed: it was labeled ""ORANGE MARMADADE"", but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to lay the pot, for fear of killing someone below, so well managed to put it in one of the closets that she fell. ""Well!"" Alice thought of herself. ""After such a fall like this, I would not think of falling down!"
"""Now I'm opening up like the biggest telescope that's ever been! Well, the feet! (because when she looked at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were going so far away). ""Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who's going to put your shoes and your stockings for you now, dear friends? I'm sure I can't! I'll be far too far to worry about you: you have to manage the best way you can—but I have to be nice to them, thought Alice, or maybe they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see. I'm going to give them a new pair of boots every Christmas."" And she's getting ready for the way she would handle it."
"The first question, of course, was how to dry up again: they had a consultation about it, and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural for Alice to find herself talking to them familiarly, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had a fairly long argument with the Lori, who finally shook herself, and would only say, ""I am older than you, and must know better."" And this Alice would not allow it, without knowing what age she was, and, as the Lori refused to say her age, there was nothing to say. Finally, the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among them, called, ""Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I will soon make you dry!"" They all sat down at once, on a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept eyes anxiously fixed, because she felt sure that she would catch a bad cold if it was not dry very early."
"Alice wasn't a little hurt, and she jumped on her feet in an instant: she looked up, but it was all dark above; before she was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, rushing down. There was no time to lose: Alice left like the wind, and was just in time to hear her say, as he was turning a corner, ""Oh my ears and the moustaches, how late it was made!"" She was close behind her when she was turning around, but the rabbit was no longer to see: she was in a long, low room, which was lit by a row of lamps hanging on the roof. There were doors all around the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down to one side and to the other, trying each door, she was sadly walking down the middle, wondering how she had never gone out again."
"At another point, Alice went afterwards, having never thought how in the world she was going to come out again. The rabbit hole went straight as a tunnel for a certain road, then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice didn't have a moment to think about stopping before she fell very deep. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, because she had a lot of time to go down to look around her and wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and do what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with closets and shelves; here and there, she saw maps and pictures hanging on pins. She took a pot of one of the shelves at her passage; he was labeled ""ORANGE MARMALADE"", but to her great disappointment it was empty: she didn't like to let go of a pot of soothing, so she managed to kill someone."
"Alice looked at the jury box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in her head down, and the poor little thing turned the tail in a melancholy manner, being quite unable to move. She soon came out, and replied, ""not that it means much,"" she said; ""I think it would be just as useful in the trial in one way as the other."" As soon as the jury had recovered a little bit from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed over to them, they began to work very diligently to write a story of the accident, except for the Lizard, who seemed to overcome too much to do anything, but sat down with his open mouth, looking at the roof of the court. ""What do you know about this?"" said the king to Alice. ""Nothing,"" said Alice."
"She was very hungry, for she had not tasted any food that day, but her faded eyes were calm and patient, speaking of an unshakeable confidence in Providence. Perhaps, she thought, a traveller could come in this way that would take compassion from her, and give her alms; then she could come back to the gare that she called ""house"", with bread to eat, and feed to light a fire. The day came near, and she sat down and waited. Finally a traveller approached. The thick snow stifled every noise, and she was not aware of her coming until her rusty figure appeared before her."
"Where are the runners? All gathered by the white columns. It is a beautiful view, - forty boys and girls in a picturesque outfit, darting with electric speed between each other, or sailing in pairs and triplets, waving, chattering, whispering, in the fullness of young joy. Some cautious are soberly tightened their straps: others, stopping on a leg, with faces puffed with ardour, suddenly crossing the suspected skate on their knee, give him a glance, and bend again. One and all are possessed with the spirit of movement. They cannot remain motionless. Their skates are part of them; and each runner seems to be enchanted. Holland is the place for skaters, after all. Where else can almost every boy and girl perform exploits on the ice that would attract a crowd so seen on Central Park? Look at Ben! I haven't seen him before. It's really amazing that the natives, nothing easy to do in the Netherlands."
"One eighth of the population as a whole was enslaved, not generally distributed on the Union, but located in the southern part of it. These slaves were a particular and powerful interest; all knew that this interest was, in one way or another, the cause of war. Strengthening, perpetuating and extending this interest was the object for which the insurgents would send the Union, even through war; while the government did not claim to have the right to do more than limit the territorial enlargement of the Union. None of the parties expected the war, the extent or the duration it had already reached; nor did they expect that the cause of the conflict could end with, or even before, the conflict itself. Everyone sought an easier triumph, and a less fundamental and stupefying result."
"Wild Robin knew that the peasants would say that the fays had pressed this green circle with their light feet. He had heard all the Scottish lore of brownies, elves, Will-o'-the-wisps, and the strange kelpies of water, who shouted to laugh eldrich. He had been told that the queen of the fairies had coveted him of his birth, and would have stolen him, only that, just as she was about to grab him from the cradle, he had sneezed; and from that moment on, the spelling was finished, and she had no control over him. Yet, despite all these stories, the boy was not afraid; and if he had been informed that any of the inanimate people were, even now, haunting his tracks, he would not have believed him.""I see, says Wild Robin, the sun drew his night hat on his eyes, and was asleep."
"I solemnly say to you that I have often tried to become an insect. But I was not even equal to that. I swear to you, gentlemen, that to be too conscious it is a disease - a very profound disease. For the daily needs of man, it would have sufficed to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is to say, half or a quarter of the sum that comes back to the fate of a cultivated man of our nineteenth unhappy century, in particular the one who has the fatal chance to live in Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional city throughout the globe. (There are intentional and unintentional cities.) It would have been enough, for example, to have the awareness through which all so-called direct persons and men of action live. I bet that I am writing all this from the assignment, to be full of mind to the detriment of the men of action; and what is more, according to the bad assignment, I click them as my officer."
"One day, a venerable man, with a noble presence, was brought to the tower, with soldiers to keep him and assistants to assist him. The prince was happy with his presence, although at first he rarely opened his lips, and it was evident that the confinement made him miserable. With troubled feet, he wandered from the window to the window of the stone tower, and ascended from history to history; but as high as there was still nothing to see as the vast, invariable plain, clothed with little grass, and flooded with the shining sun; the herds, herds, and shepherds sometimes moved through it, but nothing else, not even a shadow, for there was no cloud in the sky to throw away one. The old man, however, always treated the prince with respect, and answered his questions with great patience, until he finally found pleasure in satisfying his curiosity."
"And by virtue of power, and for this purpose, I order and declare that all persons held as slaves within these designated States, and certain parts of States, shall be free, and that the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities of those States, shall recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons. And I hereby call upon the people thus declared free to refrain from any violence, except in the case of necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases where they are authorized, they work faithfully for a reasonable wage. And I declare and make known, that these persons of appropriate condition, shall be received in the armed service of the United States, to garrison the forts, positions, posts and other places, and for man ships of all kinds in this service. And on this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, justified by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the prejudic judgment of humanity, and the grace of the Almighty God."
"Rinaldo was one of the four sons of Aymon, who married Aya, the sister of Charlemagne. Thus Rinaldo was nephew of Charlemagne and cousin of Orlando. When Rinaldo had grown old enough to take up arms, Orlando had won for himself a name illustrated by his exploits against the Saracens, whom Charlemagne and his brave knights had driven out of France. Orlando's fame excited a noble emulation in Rinaldo. Desirous of going to search for glory, he wandered in the country near Paris, and one day lived at the foot of a tree a superb horse, fully equipped and loaded with a complete armor. Rinaldo put on armor and mounted the horse, but did not take the sword."
"She was not a beautiful woman, my sister; and I had the general impression that she had to make Joe Gargery marry her in the hand. Joe was a fair man, with loops of flax hair on either side of her smooth face, and with eyes of a blue so undecided that they seemed to have been mixed in one way or another with their own whites. He was a gentle, good-natured, mild-tempered man, easy to hold, stupid, dear friend, a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness. My sister, Mrs Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a redness of skin that I sometimes wondered if it was possible that she would wash herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall and boned, and almost always wore a coarse apron, attached to her face behind with two loops, and having an impregnable square bib in front, which was filled with pins and needles."
"It is the domestic deer or the park deer, and there are not two animals that can get closer to each other than the deer and to him, and yet not two animals remain more distinct, or avoid each other with a more inveterate animosity. They make neither herd nor mix together, and therefore never give to an intermediate breed; it is even rare, unless they have been transported, to find other deer in a country where deer are numerous. It is very easy to tame, and feeds on many things that deer refuse: it also approaches the deer, and keeps its vein better. The deer produces a fawn, sometimes two, but rarely three. In short, they resemble the deer in all its natural habits, and the greatest difference between them is the length of their life: the deer, it is said, lives until the age of thirty-five or forty years, and the deer does not live more than twenty. As they are smaller than the deer, it is likely that their growth is complete."
"Here, the idles of the place gather to relax and chat, to look for the boats that go outwards that are in the Channel, and to criticize the appearance and glorify the abilities of the small fleet of Looe fishing boats, at the rudimentary anchor in front of them at the entrance to the bay. The inhabitants have about fourteen hundred inhabitants, and are as good and unsophisticated as you will meet anywhere. Fishing and coastal trade form their main means of subsistence. Women take a very fair share of the hard work of the hands of men. You see them constantly carrying coals from the ships to the dock in curious wheelbarrows: they laugh, shout and run in the way of each other constantly: but these small irregularities seem to help them, rather than hinder them, in the pursuit of their tasks. As for men, an absorbent interest seems to govern them all."
"Put yourself at the same level as the person you are speaking to, and under penalty of being considered a pedantic idiot, by refraining from explaining any expression or word that you can use. Never, unless you are asked to do so, talk about your own business or profession in society; limit your entire conversation to the subject or the pursuit that is your own specialty is weak and vulgar. Do the subject for the conversation suits the company in which you are placed. Joyous, light conversation will sometimes be as out of place, as a sermon would be to a dancing party. Leave your serious or gay conversation as it pleases time or place. In a dispute, if you cannot reconcile the parties, withdraw from them."
"Many believe that politeness is only a mask worn in the world to hide bad passions and bad impulses, and to demonstrate that they possess virtues that do not really exist in the heart; thus, this politeness is only hypocrisy and concealment. Do not believe this; be sure that those who profess such doctrine exercise themselves the deceit they condemn so much. These people search politeness, because, to be truly a lady, one must bear the principles in all the circumstances of life, in the family circle, the most intimate friendship, and never forget to extend the nice courtesy of life to everyone."
"The rush of the water and the boom of the mill bring a dreamy deafness, which seems to increase the calm of the scene. They are like a big curtain of sound, closing an out of the world beyond. And now there is the thunder of the huge covered cart that comes home with bags of grain. This honest carpenter thinks of his dinner, becoming sadly dry in the oven at this late hour; but he will not touch him until he has fed his horses, - the strong beasts, subjected, to the gentle eyes, which, I love him, have the appearance of a gentle reproach to him of their flashers, that he should break his whip on them as if they needed this tip! See how they stretch their shoulders on the slope towards the bridge, with more energy because they are so close to the house. Look at their big chamoisant feet that seem to grasp the firm earth, at the patient strength of their necks, bent under the heavy collar, to the powerful muscles of their struggle axes!"
"It was one of their happy mornings. They were trotting and sitting together, without thinking that life would always change much for them: they were only fattering and not going to school, and it would always be like holidays; they were always living together and loving each other. And the mill with its booming — the great chestnut tree under which they played in the houses — their little river, the Ripple, where the banks seemed as at home, and Tom always saw the rats of water, while Maggie gathered the purple peaks of the reeds, which she forgot and then dropped — all the great Floss, along which they wandered with a sense of travel, to see the rushed spring, the horrible Eagre, ascending like a hungry monster, or seeing the great brother who had washed and moaned like a man — these things would always be the same for them. Tom thought that people were at a disadvantage who were always living on any other place, she didn't see the great one; and Magne who had washed and moaned like a man."
"She read again and again in the old book, eagerly devouring the dialogues with the invisible Teacher, the motive of the pain, the source of all the strength, returning to her after she had been called, and reading until the sun descended behind the willows. With all the haste of an imagination that could never rest in the present, she sat down in the deep dusk forming plans of self-humiliation and whole devotion; and, in the ardour of the first discovery, the renunciation seemed to her the entrance into this satisfaction that she had so much time to desire in vain."
"Seedlings from the same fruit, and young of the same litter, sometimes differ considerably from one another, although young people and parents, as Muller pointed out, have apparently been exposed to the same living conditions; and this shows how the direct effects of living conditions are not important in relation to the laws of reproduction, growth, and inheritance; for if the action of conditions had been direct, if one of the young had varied, they would probably have varied in the same way; to judge how much, in the case of any variation, should be attributed to the direct action of heat, humidity, light, food, etc., is more difficult: my impression is that, with animals, such agencies have produced very little direct effect, although apparently more in the case of plants."
"His message perplexed his mind to the point that he was lazy, several times, to remove his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was strongly bald, he had stiff hair, black, standing all the way up the hill, and growing almost to its wide, blunt nose. It was so much like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a wall heavily trampled than a head of hair, that the best player with the jumping frog could have refused it, as the most dangerous man in the world to go further. While he trotted with the message that he had to deliver to the night guard in his box at the door of the Tellson bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities inside, the shadows of the night took him forms as he came out of the message, and took such forms to the mare who rose from his subjects deprived of dissatisfaction."
"The house is in some respects curious. It has enjoyed for two years the reputation of being haunted. It is a large and majestic residence, surrounded by what was once a garden, but which is today only a green enclosure used to bleach the clothes. The dry basin of what was a fountain, and some fruit trees striped and uncut, indicate that this place in the last days has been a pleasant shady retreat, filled with fruits and flowers and the gentle murmur of the waters. The house is very spacious. A noble-sized room leads to a large spiral staircase that winds through its center, while the various apartments are of imposing dimensions. It has been built for fifteen or twenty years since by Mr. A., the well-known merchant of New York, who, five years ago, threw the business world into convulsions by a huge bank fraud."
"It may not be necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We do not speak of children, nor of adolescents under the age that the law can set as that of manhood or of women. Those who are still in a state to be required to be cared for by others, must be protected from their own actions as well as from external injuries. For the same reason, we can leave aside the backward states of society in which the race itself can be regarded as in its non-age. The first difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is rarely a choice of means to overcome them; and a leader with a spirit of improvement is justified in the use of any opportune one that would reach an end, perhaps otherwise inaccessible."
"I dare not say how many hours we have spent to the torrent of robbery without meeting a soul or seeing a human habitation; it was terribly hot too, and we wanted ordinary wine; Cerviers seemed never to come - always the same robust precipices, snowy heights, the torrent of robbery and the stony road, butterflies beautiful and innumerable, the flowers to match, the sky without clouds. Finally we are there; through the city, or rather the village, the alleys of the river furiously, the houses dismantled and the walls of separation offering palpable traces of the terrible floods of the previous year, not a house near the river was healthy, much uninhabitable, and more so as I am certain that few of us would like to live. However, this is what is the case, and we hope that a house near the river is closed, that man is not dead, that man is not dead, that man is not dead."
"It is hardly possible to imagine with what admiration and aspirant pleasure they were all received. They possessed to an eminent degree all these qualities which invariably contribute to making quickly and definitively popular any literary work. They were written in a phraseology whose all powers were universally felt, and which being both ancient, familiar, and now rarely written, were therefore adapted to serve all the worthy and picturesque uses of poetry, without making it intelligible. Imaging and sentiments were both natural, impressive, and interesting. These subjects of satire and scandal in which rustic delights; this humorous imitation of character, and this association of ideas, familiar and striking, but not naturally allied with one another, which forced to shake its sides with laughter; these fantasies of superstition, where one prostrates and trembles again; those which affect the feelings and images of true religion, which are both expensive and horrific, were suddenly raised and raised up in the heart; all of them were represented by true poetry, and raised in the heart."
"At one point, a guitar and a Æolian harp had been hung among the branches of the old oak by happy traveling apprentices; now they cling to it again, and the wind slowly plays with their strings. And now the dream changed. A new and stronger current of life flowed through it, up to its lowest roots, up to its highest branches, up to its very leaves. The tree felt in its roots that a warm life was moving in the earth, and that it was becoming larger and larger; its trunk was flying more and more, its crown was growing; and it was flying away and extending again. It felt that its power was also growing, and that it wanted to move upward and upward towards the warm and bright sun. Already, it was turning over the clouds, drifting under it, now like a troupe of dark birds of passage, now like herds of great white swans."
"The year 1840 found all the Brontes living at home, with the exception of Anne. I don't know why the plan to send Branwell to study at the Royal Academy was abandoned; probably, on request, it was found that the expenses of such a life were greater than his father's meagre finances could afford, even with the help that Charlotte's work to Miss Wooler gave, by providing. for Anne's board and education. I understand from what I heard, that Branwell must have been seriously disappointed when the plan fell. His talents were certainly very brilliant, and from that he was fully conscious, and fervently desired, by their use, either by writing or drawing, to make himself a 'name. At the same time, he would probably have found his great love for pleasure and irregular habits a great obstacle in his path to fame; but these blems in his character were only additional reasons why he aspired after a Londonian life, in which he thought he could obtain every stimulus to his intellect, which would already have been strong."
"His subjects called him Lord of the world, and he gave them a speech every year about the greatness of his mighty empire. His queen, Hammerheel, was the greatest beauty of Stumpinghame. His majesty was not much less than a fishing boat; their six children promised to be just as beautiful, and everything went well until the birth of their seventh son. For a long time, no one in the palace could understand what was going on — the ladies in wait seemed so surprised, and the king so vexed; but finally, it was murmured by the city that the seventh child of the queen was born with feet so small that they looked like nothing ever seen or heard at Stumpinghame, except the feet of the fairies; the chronicles provided no example of such a affliction ever having regard to the royal family."
"On the whole, the result of this investigation seems to be that the Masters of the past have no inherent right, derived from ancient monuments, to a seat in the Grand Lodge; but as each Grand Lodge has the power, within certain limits, to make regulations for its own government, it may or may not admit them to membership, according to its own notion of opportunity. Some of the Grand Lodges have not only freed the Masters of the past but also the Directors, and the limited membership to Interim Masters. This innovation arose from the fact that the payment of mileage and expenses to three representatives would entail a heavy burden on the revenues of the Grand Lodge. Reason may have been imperative; but in practice, the pecuniary opportunity was made to exceed an ancient use. By determining, then, who are the constitutional members of a Grand Lodge, deriving from their inherent right, I should say that they are the Masters and Guardians of all the regular lodges in the jurisdiction, with the Grand Officers chosen by them."
"It is necessary to have a piazza. The house was large, my narrow fortune, so that, in order to build a panoramic piazza, a tower and a tower, it could not be — although, considering the question by rule and by place, the carpenters, in the most nice way, were willing to satisfy my most distant desires, how many feet I forgot. On one of the four sides would be prudent to grant me what I wanted. Now, what side? To the east, this long camp of the hills of the heartstone, moving far away to Quito; and every autumn, a small white flake of something suddenly flowing, of a cold morning, of the highest cliff — the lamb of the season, its first fleece; and then the Christmas dawn, dredging these high lands dim with plaids and tartans with red beard — good view of your piazza, that. Beautiful view; but, north of Charlemagne—can not have the hills of heart stone with Charlemagne."
"At first, I felt like I was going to be very expensive to dress him. But it proved, of course, at the same time, that, whenever he was outside, I had to be at home. And I went, during the brilliant period of his success, to so few of those terrible contests that require a black coat and what the ungodly calls, after Mr. Dickens, a white choker, that in the happy retreat of my own dresses and jackets my days were passing as happy and cheap as those of another Thalaba. And Polly states that there was never a year when the tailors cost so little. He lived (Dennis, not Thalaba) in his wife's room over the kitchen. He had orders never to show himself at that window. When he appeared at the front of the house, I withdrew to my sanctissimum and my dress. In short, the Dutchman and his wife, in the old weather box, had no less to do with him than him and me."
"Hale, if she was telling the truth, could have answered with a ready list, ""a silver grey ice silk, a white chip cap, oh! dozens of things for the wedding, and hundreds of things for the house."" Margaret only knew that her mother had not found it convenient to come, and she was not sorry to think that their meeting and salvation would take place in Helstone parsonage, rather than, during the confusion of the last two or three days, in the house at Harley Street, where she herself had to play the role of Figaro, and was wanted everywhere at the same time. Her mind and body were now stumbling with the memory of everything she had done and said in the last 48 hours."
"He darkened himself while we were in the office, and we went together to take our hats. The narrow business street was deserted. The heavy iron shutters closed darkly on the windows. One or two offices were fighting against the glow of a primitive candle, by the light of which a perplexed accountant sat down, and chased for his error. A clerk neglected to pass by, whistling. But the great tide of life had swallowed up. We heard his roaring away, and the noise came into this silent street as the whisper of the ocean in an inner delle. ""You will come to dinner with us, Titbottom?"" He continued to walk with me, and I think that we were both happy when we arrived at home, and Prue came to meet us, saying, ""Do you know that I was hoping that you would bring Mr. Titbottom to dinner?"" Titbottom smiled softly and replied, ""He could have brought his glasses with him more, and I was happy to have a man."""
"Nippers, the second on my list, was a five- and twenty-year-old, a bit pirated. I have always considered him a victim of two evil powers, ambition and indignation. Ambition was gained by a certain impatience of the duties of a simple copyist, an unjustified usurpation of strictly professional affairs, as the original preparation of legal documents. The indigestion seemed tainted by occasional and grinning nervous irritability, causing the teeth to grind audibly on the errors made in the copy; unnecessary, whistled, rather than spoken, maldictions in the heat of business; and especially by a continuous discontent with the height of the table where he worked. Although with a very ingenious mechanical trick, Nippers could never get this table to suit him. He put under it blocks of various kinds, pieces of dough, and finally went so far as to try an exquisite adjustment by pieces of folded paper."
"In response to my advertisement, a young man standing still one morning, stood on the threshold of my office, the door being open, because it was summer. I can see this figure now — pallidly neat, pitiful, incurable forlorn! It was Bartleby. After a few words touching his qualifications, I hired him, happy to have among my copyist body a man so singularly sedative of one aspect, that I thought I could operate profitably on the flying character of Turkey, and the fire of one of the Nippers. I should have said before the folding doors in ground glass divided my premises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my tinkerers, the other by myself."
"Some time after my father's release, he went to the town of Minerva, Essex County, N.Y., where I was born, in July 1808. How long he remained in the latter place that I cannot determine definitively. From there he went to Granville, Washington County, near a place known as Slyborough, where he worked for a few years on Clark Northup's farm, also his old master's relative; from there he went to the farm of Alden, Moss Street, a short distance north of Sandy Hill village; and from there to the farm now owned by Russell Prattt, on the road leading from Fort Edward to Argyle, where he continued to reside until his death, which took place on the 22nd day of November 1829."
"If he engages in controversies of any kind, his disciplined intelligence preserves him from the dishonest imprudentness of better spirits, perhaps, but less educated; who, like blunt weapons, teares and hackers instead of cutting clean, who deceives the point of the argument, wastes their strength on trifles, distorts their adversary, and leaves the question more involved than they find him. He may be right or wrong in his opinion, but he is too clear to be unjust; it is as simple as he is forced, and as brief as he is decisive. Nowhere will we find more candour, consideration, indulgence: he throws himself into the minds of his adversaries, he accounts for their mistakes. He knows the weakness of human reason as well as his strength, his province and his limits. If he is incredible, he will be too deep and great-spirit to mock or act against religion; he is too wise to be dogmatistic or fanatical in his infidelity."
"This is the anniversary of your national independence, and of your political freedom. This is for you, what the Passover was for the emancipated people of God. It brings your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance, and to the signs, and wonders, associated with this act, and that day. This celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the Republic of America is now 76 years old. I am happy, fellow citizens, that your nation is so young. Seventy-six years, although a good age for a man, is only a mere stain in the life of a nation. Three points of years and ten is the time allocated for individual men; but the nations count their years by thousands. According to this fact, you are, even now, only at the beginning of your national career, always in the period of childhood. I repeat, I am happy that it is so."
"Shelby had gone on a visit, and Eliza was standing in the veranda, rather taking care of the retired car, when a hand was placed on her shoulder. She was turning, and a bright smile lit up her beautiful eyes. ""George, is it you? How did you scare me! Well, I am so glad that you came! Missis left to spend the afternoon; then come to my little room, and we will have time for ourselves."" By saying this, she drew him into a nice little apartment that opens on the veranda, where she usually sat at the sewing, at the call of her mistress. ""How happy!"" — Why don't you smile? — and look at Harry — how he grew up."" The boy was shyly about his father through his curls, holding up close to the skirts of his mother's dress. ""Is he not handsome?"" said Eliza, lifting his long curls and kissing him."
"We went from the path through the forest: a whole herd of naked-headed boys surrounded us. They would all be our guides; one cried out longer than the other, and each gave his contradictory explanation, how high the water was, and how far she was not standing, or could stay. There was also a great difference of opinion among the scholars. We soon stopped on a rock covered with ingots, a dizzying terrace. Before us, but far below, was the roaring water, the fall of hell, and on this, again, fall after fall, the rich, fast, flowing up--the exit from the largest lake of Sweden. What a sight! what roaring and roaring, above! It is like the waves of the sea, but of the effervescent champagne----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"The most remarkable feature of the Roman constitution is the division of the people into Patricians and Plebeians, and our first investigation must be the origin of this separation. It is clearly impossible that such a distinction could have existed from the beginning, because no one would have consented in a new community to the investment of a class with particular privileges. We find that all Roman kings, after submitting a city, drafted a part of its inhabitants in Rome; and if they did not destroy the submissive place, they garred it with a Roman colony. The foreigners thus brought to Rome were not admitted to the participation of civil rights; they were like the inhabitants of a business town that are excluded from the elective franchise: by successive immigrations, the number of people thus disqualified became more numerous than that of the first inhabitants or of the free old, and they naturally sought a share in the government, as a means of protecting their people and their property."
"Whatever the truth there might be in these rather passionate representations, and for myself he did not want a painful feeling of their truth, it did not appear in any case what help or remedy any friend of Sterling, and especially such a relationship to the question like me, could tempt in the meantime. Perhaps to endure in patience until the dust arose again, as any dust does if you leave it well alone? Much obscuration would thus of his own will fall; and, in the account of Mr. Hare himself, apart from his comment, many features of the true character of Sterling would become decipherable to those who sought them. Censorship, blamed for this work of Mr. Hare was naturally far from my thoughts. A work that is distinguished by human piety and candid intelligence; which, in all details, is prudent, lucid, exact; and which offers, as we say, to the observant reader who will interpret the facts, many features of Sterling apart from his heterodoxy, above all, is not his own."
"My mother had a certain foretaste at the second glance, that it was Miss Betsey. The setting sun shines on the strange lady, above the fence of the garden, and she came to the door with a stiffness fallen from her face and a compress of face that could not have belonged to anyone else. When she arrived at the house, she gave another proof of her identity. My father had often suggested that she was rarely acting like an ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and looked at this identical window, pressing the tip of her nose against the glass at this point, which my poor dear mother said was perfectly flat and white in an instant. She gave my mother such a trick, that I was always convinced that I am indebted to Miss Betsey for being born on a Friday."
"The bird of Phoenix, do you not know him? The bird of Paradise, the holy swan of singing! On the car of Thespis, he sat under the cover of a chattering raven, and beat his black wings, bathed with wine lees; on the resounding harp of Iceland swept the red beak of the swan; on the shoulder of Shakespeare, he sat under the cover of the raven of Odin, and whispered in the ear of the poet ""Immortality!"" and at the feast of minstrels, he fled into the rooms of the Wartburg. Do you not know him the bird of Phoenix? He sang to you the Marseillaise, and you kissed the feather that fell from his wing; he came into the radiance of Paradise, and perchance you went away from him to the sparrow that was sitting on his wings."
"It is natural to believe in the great men. If the companions of our childhood were to become heroes, and their status would not surprise us. Any mythology opens up with halfgods, and the circumstance is high and poetic; that is, their genius is paramount. In the legends of Gautama, the first men ate the earth, and found it deliciously sweet. Nature seems to exist for the excellent. The world is supported by the truth of the good men: they make the earth healthy. Those who lived with them found life happy and nutritious. Life is sweet and tolerable only in our belief in such a society; and in fact, or ideally, we succeed in living with superiors. We call our children and our lands by their names. Their names are forged in the verbs of the language, their works and effigies are in our houses, and every circumstance of the day recalls an an anecdote of them."
"Those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in which they have been written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the history of the human race; for it is remarkable that no transcription of them has ever been made in a modern language, unless our civilization itself can be regarded as such a transcription. Homer has never yet been printed in English, neither has Æschylus, nor even Virgil, works as refined, as solid, and as beautiful as the morning itself; for later, writers, say what we want from their genius, have rarely, if ever, matched the elaborate beauty and finish and heroic and heroic literary works of the elders. They speak only of forgetting those who have never known them. It will be early enough to forget them when we have the learning and genius that will enable us to assist and appreciate them."
"This American government, what is it that a tradition, though recent, which strives to pass on to posterity, but which loses part of its integrity every moment? It does not have the vitality and strength of one living man; for one man can bow it to his will. It is a kind of wooden rifle for the people themselves; and if he should use it seriously as one true against the other, it will surely divide itself. But it is not the least necessary for this; for the people must have a complicated machine or another, and hear his din, to satisfy the idea of government that he has. Governments thus show how men can be imposed successfully, even to impose themselves, for their own benefit."
"The violations of the truth, which dishonor poetry and painting, are therefore for the most part limited to the treatment of their subjects. But in architecture another and less subtle, more despicable, the violation of the truth is possible; a direct falseness of the affirmation concerning the nature of the material, or the quantity of work. And this is, in the full sense of the word, false; it is as worthy of reprobation as any other moral delinquency; it is unworthy both of architects and of nations; and it has been a sign, wherever it has largely and with tolerance, of a singular lowering of the arts; that it is not a sign worse than this, a general lack of severe probity, can only be accounted for by our knowledge of the strange separation that exists for centuries between the arts and all other subjects of human intellect, as questions of conscience."
"The next day, at the dawn of the day, he put on his armor and mounted his loader, and traveled through distant lands and deserted mountains. At last he came to the valley which Kynon had described to him, and it was certain that he sought to move along the valley, along the river, and he followed his way until he came to the plain and to the interior of the castle. When he approached the castle, he saw the young people who were firing their daggers at the place where Kynon had seen them, and the yellow man who owned the castle standing. And Owain had not greeted the yellow man earlier than he had greeted him in return."
"When we entered the living room, we found this lady of honour sitting in her armchair at the corner of the fire, working far from her knitting, according to her usual custom, when she had nothing else to do. She had swept the fireplace, and made a bright fire for our reception; the servant had just brought the tea-tray; and Rose produced the sugar-basin and the caddy of the closet in the side of the black oak, which shone like polished ebony, in the joyful dusk of the living room. ""Well, they are both, cried my mother, looking around us without delaying the movement of her agile fingers and glittered needles. Now close the door, and come to the fire, while Rose is preparing the tea; I am sure you must be hungry; — and tell me what you have been all day; — I like to know what my children have been."""
"Miss Tox's dress, although perfectly genteel and good, had a certain character of angularity and leanness. She was accustomed to wearing strange little grassy flowers in her hats and caps. Strange herbs were sometimes perceived in her hair; and he was observed by the curious, of all her collars, fripons, tuckers, bracelets and other gossamer items — in fact all that she wore that had two ends to unite there — that the two ends were never in good condition, and did not meet quite without struggle. She had fur articles to carry winter, such as tips, boas and muffs, which stood at the end in a creeping manner, and were not all elegant."
"At about six o'clock in the New Year, Shumkov returned home. Arkady Ivanovich, who was lying on the bed, woke up and looked at his friend with his eyes half closed. He saw that Vasya had on his very beautiful pants and a very clean shirt in front of him. This, of course, struck him. ""Where did Vasya go like this? And he had not dined at home either!"" Meanwhile, Shumkov had lit a candle, and Arkady Ivanovich immediately guessed that his friend intended to wake him up accidentally. Vasya, in fact, cleared his throat twice, walked twice and went down the room, and finally, quite accidentally, he left the pipe, which he had begun to fill in the corner by the stove, slipping out of his hands. Arkady Ivanovich laughed. ""Vasya, pretend!"" he said. ""Arkasha, you don't sleep?"" ""I really can't say, it seems to me that I am not."""
"I heard the rain always beating on the window of the staircase, and the wind screaming in the grove behind the room; I grew up in cold degrees as a stone, and then my courage sank. My usual mood of humiliation, of self-doubt, of forlorn depression, fell wet on the embers of my decaying ire. Everyone said that I was mean, and maybe I could be so; what thought had I only been to think of dying of hunger? It was certainly a crime: and could I die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In this vault I was told that Mr. Reed was buried; and led by this thought to remember his idea, I stayed on her by collecting breads."
"One night, the stranger woke up — he slept with the doors of the balcony open — the curtain before it was lifted by the wind, and he thought that a strange glow came from the house of the opposite neighbour; all the flowers were shining like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the midst of the flowers stood a thin and graceful young girl — it was as if she were shining also; the light was really hurting her eyes. He now opened them wide — yes, he was quite awake; with a spring he was on the ground; he was slowly fearing behind the curtain, but the young girl was gone; the flowers were no longer shining, but they were there, fresh and blooming as never before; the door was in jar, and far inside the music sounded so sweet and delicious, it could not really be melted in sweet thoughts. Yet, it was like a piece of enchantment. And who lived there? Where was the present entrance?"
"As soon as the tea was finished, Mrs. Morland and her daughter repaired their toilets. Fortunately, fashion and good taste decided that, at a summer party, the ladies' costume should never go beyond an elegant simplicity. Therefore, our two ladies, preparing for their intended appearance at Mrs. St. Leonard's, were allowed to dress in a way that did not seem out of place in the little company they were waiting to meet at the Watkinson. On a lawn underwear, Caroline Morland put on a white orgy with lace and decorated with pink ribbon bows. At the back of her head was a crown of fresh and beautiful pink flowers, tied with a similar ribbon. Mrs. Morland wore a black garnadine on a satin, and a white lace cap. There was only a quarter of nine hours when their car stopped at Watkinson's door. The front of the house looked very dark."
"I am far from saying that all London workers live in need like the three previous families. I know very well that ten are somewhat better off, where one is so totally trampled by society; but I affirm that thousands of people who are industrialized and worthy of being respected, much more worthy than all the rich in London, are in a condition unworthy of human beings; and that all proletarians, without exception, are exposed to a similar fate without fault of his own and despite all possible efforts. But, despite all that, those who have some kind of shelter are lucky, lucky compared to the absolute homeless. In London, fifty thousand human beings rise every morning, not knowing where they must lay their heads at night. The luckiest of this multitude, those who succeed in keeping a penny or two until the evening, enter a house of accommodation, such as abounding in every big city, where they find a bed. But what a bed! These houses are filled with beds, four, five, six beds in a room."
"Master William Horner came to school at the age of eighteen: tall, lank, straight, and straight, with a mouth of the most cunning and solemn kind. His face and movements were those of a puppet cut off by shingles and jerked off by a rope; and his address corresponded very well to his appearance. Never did this primitive mouth give way before a laugh. A weak and hazy smile was the widest deviation of his convenience, and this unusual disturbance made wrinkles in the flat and lean cheeks like those of the surface of a lake, after the intrusion of a stone. Master Horner knew well what belonged to the pedagogical character, and this facial solemnity was high on the list of indispensable qualifications."
"The ball is composed of silk, varnished with liquid rubber. It is large, containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas; but as the coal gas was used instead of the more expensive and annoying hydrogen, the machine's support power, when it is completely inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than 2,500 pounds. Coal gas is not only much cheaper, but is easily bought and managed. ""For its introduction into the common use for aerostation purposes, we owe Mr. Charles Green. Until its discovery, the inflation process was not only excessively expensive, but uncertain. Two, and even three days, were frequently wasted in vain attempts to obtain a volume of hydrogen sufficient to fill a balloon, of which he had a great tendency to escape, due to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere."
"The winters in the latitude of Sullivan Island are rarely very severe, and in the autumn of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is deemed necessary. By mid-October, however, there was a remarkable cold day. Just before sunset, I blurred my way through the eternal greens to my friend's cabin, which I had not visited for several weeks — my residence being, at that time, at Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the island, while the passage and ironing facilities were very far behind those of today. Upon arriving at the cabin I rapped, as usual, and obtained no response, sought the key where I knew it was secret, unlocked the door and entered."
"The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a simple head and shoulders, done in what is technically called a way of vignette; a lot in the style of Sully's favorite heads. The arms, the breast, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly in the vague and deep shadow that formed the bottom of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and watered in Moresque. As a thing of art, nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it was neither the execution of the work nor the immortal beauty of the face, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved. Less than all, could have been that my fantasy, shaken by its sleepy half, had confused the head for that of a living person. I could see both the peculiarities of design, the vine-making, and the frame, I had to instantly unravel this idea, even prevented me from its momentary entertainment."
"In Paris during the spring and part of summer 18, I realized that there had been a Mr. C. Auguste Dupin. This young man was of excellent quality, indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of perverse events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed to it, and he ceased to be infested in the world, or to take care of the recovery of his fortunes. With the permission of his creditors, he still had in his possession a small remnant of his heritage; and, on the income resulting from it, he succeeded, through a rigorous economy, in obtaining the necessities of life, without disturbing himself of his superfluousities. The books, in fact, were his only luxury, and in Paris they were easily obtained. Our first meeting was in an obscure library on Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our being in search of the same very rare and remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion."
"The disease of Lady Madeline had long flouted the skill of her doctors. An established apathy, a progressive wastage of the person, and frequent and transient conditions of a partially cataleptic character were the unusual diagnosis. Up to now, she had constantly endured the pressure of her illness, and had not finally entered bed; but at the close of the evening of my arrival at home, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostratory power of the destroyer; and I learned that the preview I had obtained of her person would probably be the last I had to get—that the lady, at least while living, would no longer be seen by me. For several days that followed, her name was not mentioned by Usher or myself; and during this period, I was seriously tempted to relieve the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together, or I listened, as in a dream, to the wild improvisations of her speaking guitar."
"It was a much easier way to accumulate wealth than to sell toys on Chatham Street, and he decided to buy and repair his fortune without delay. The auctioneer began to sell. Other parcels were offered and sold, and all the buyers were promised immense benefits for their business. Finally came a parcel more precious than anything else. The company pressed on the stand, and Mr. Poopoo did the same. ""I now offer you these beautiful lots, wonderfully located on Long Island, with precious water privileges. Property in fief – undisputed title – term of sale, money – made ready for delivery immediately after the sale. How much for them? Give them a start to something? How much? The auctioneer looked around; there were no bidders. Finally, he took Mr. Poopoo's eye."
"I put on my old coat, and I took my umbrella, like a slight rain was falling. No one was to be seen in the streets except a few women, who had thrown their skirts on their heads. Here and there, a taxi driver or a trader with his umbrella was seen up. From the upper classes only one official was seen here and there. I saw at the crossing of the street, and I thought to myself, ""Ah! my friend, you don't go to the office, but after that young woman who walks in front of you. You're just like the officers who run after every girl they see."" As I was therefore following the train of my thoughts, I saw a car stop in front of a shop as I did. I recognized it immediately; it was our manager's car. ""He has nothing to do in the shop, I thought; it's his daughter."""
"The stars awaken a certain reverence, because they are always present, they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a kind of impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never bears a medium appearance. Neither the wisest man extorts his secret, nor loses his curiosity by discovering all his perfection. Nature has never become a toy to a wise mind. Flowers, animals, mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they had enchanted the simplicity of his childhood. When we speak of nature in this way, we have a distinct sense but the most poetic in mind. We hear the integrity of the impression made by multiple natural objects. This is what distinguishes the wooden stick from the woodcut, from the tree of the poet. The charming landscape that I saw this morning, is invinciblely composed of about twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke this, and Manning the wood beyond. But none of them has the landscape. There is an eye that does not fit in the horizon."
"January of the same year, after February. — I can never understand what kind of country this Spain really is. The popular customs and rules of the court label are quite extraordinary. I do not understand them at all, at all. Today my head was thorny, although I cried out as loud as I could, that I did not want to be a monk. What happened after, when they began to let cold water go wrong on my head, I do not know. I never experienced such infernal torments. I almost went crazy, and they had difficulty holding on to me. The importance of this strange custom is completely hidden from me. It is very stupid and unreasonable. Nor can I understand the stupidity of kings who did not do it before."
"Arriving at the seminary, all the crowd of students dispersed into the small classrooms with small windows, wide doors and blackened benches. Suddenly, they were filled with a murmur of tons. The teachers heard the students' lessons repeated, some in shrapnel and others in deep voices that sounded like a distant boom. While the lessons were said, the teachers kept a keen eye open to see whether pieces of cake or other daisies were coming out of their students' pockets; if so, they were quickly confiscated. When this crowd learned arrived a little earlier than usual, or when it was known that the teachers would come a little later, a battle would ensue, as expected by a common agreement. In this battle all had to take part, even the monitors who were appointed to deal with the order and morality of the whole school. Two theologians generally arranged the conditions of the battle: if each class were to be divided into two parts, or if all the students had to divide in two half."
"When we arrived at the wharf, there were three of our number who assumed authority to direct our operations, to which we readily submitted. They divided us into three parts, with the aim of embarking the three ships that contained the tea at the same time. The name of the one who commanded the division to which I had been assigned was Leonard Pitt. The names of the other commanders that I had never known. We were immediately ordered by the respective commanders to embark all the ships at the same time, which we promptly obeyed. The commander of the division to which I belonged, as soon as we were on board the ship, named me boatwain, and ordered me to go to the master and ask him for the keys of the hatches and a dozen candles. I made the request accordingly, and the captain promptly responded, and delivered the items; but at the same time asked me not to cause damage to the ship or rigging."
"The former queen, princess of the Austrian house, had long pushed her husband to resist the necessity of time. She was haughty and intrepid; she cherished a love of power, and bitter contempt for the one who had stripped herself of a kingdom. For the sake of her children only, she consented to remain, the thorn of the regency, a member of the English republic. When she became a widow, she turned all her thoughts to the education of her son Adrian, second Earl of Windsor, in order to accomplish her ambitious purposes; and with the milk of his mother, he soaked up, and was destined to grow up with the constant goal of acquiring her lost crown again. Adrian was now fifteen years old. He was addicted to study, and imprisoned beyond his years of learning and talent: report says that he had already begun to play against the views of his mother, and to entertain the republican principles."
"Shortly afterwards, I tried, by means that I must omit for lack of space, to transfer to London. And now began this last and more ferocious step of my long suffering; without using a disproportionate expression, I could say, of my agony. For I have now suffered, for more than sixteen weeks, the physical anguish of hunger in. I vary degrees of intensity, but perhaps as bitter as ever no human being may have suffered that survived it would not unnecessarily harass the feelings of my reader by a detail of all that I have endured; for extremities such as these, in all circumstances of fault or of the heaviest guilt, cannot be envisaged, even in the description, without a pity that is painful to the natural goodness of the human heart. At least on this occasion, it suffices to say that a few fragments of bread from an individual's breakfast table (who thought I was sick, but did not know of my being in need), and these at uncertain intervals, constituted my whole support."
"In addition to his other vocations, he was the master singer of the neighborhood, and gathered many brilliant shillings to instruct the young people in psalmodia. It was not a little vanity for him on Sunday, to take his place in front of the gallery of the church, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried the palm of the parson. It is certain, his voice resounded well over all the rest of the congregation; and there are special tremors still to be heard in this church, and which can even be heard half a mile away, all the opposite of the mill, on Sunday morning, which are said legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers few fortunes, in this ingenious way that is commonly called ""by hook and swindler"", the worthy pedagogue went away enough, and was thought, by all those who did not understand anything of the boss's work, to have a wonderfully easy life."
"His robe was a tunic of green forest, furred to the throat and handcuffs with what was called minor; a kind of fur inferior to the quality of ermine, and formed, it is believed, from the skin of the grey squirrel. This doublet hung without a button on a narrow dress of scarmosis that was seated tight to his body; he had panties of the same, but they did not reach below the lower part of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. His feet had sandals in the same manner with the peasants, but of finer materials, and fixed at the front with golden clasps. He had gold bracelets on his arms, and a large necklace of the same precious metal around his neck. On his waist he wore a richly-knit belt, in which was stuck a short straight sword with two sharps, with a sharp point, so willing to hang almost perpendicularly on his side."
"The great mistake in Rip's composition was a strong aversion to all kinds of profitable work. It could not be a lack of perseverance; for he was besieging himself on a wet rock, with a stem as long and heavy as a lance, and fish all day without murmuring, even if he should not be encouraged by a single snacker. He would carry a piece of bird on his shoulder for hours together, hiding himself through the woods and the swamps, and on top hill and down Dale, to shoot some wild squirrels or pigeons. He would never refuse to help a neighbour even in the hardest work, and was a man of the foreground to all countries frown Indian corn, or build stone fences; the women of the village, too, used to use it to do their shopping, and to do strange little jobs as their less obliging husbands would not do for them."
"It was in a sad night of November that I saw the fulfillment of my nails. With an almost agonizing anxiety, I gathered the instruments of life around me, in order to infuse a spark of being in the lifeless thing that was at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain fell untangled against the windows, and my candle was almost burned, when, by the light of the light half extinguished, I saw the dull yellow eye of the open creature; it breathed hard, and a convulsive movement was shaking its members. How can I describe my emotions to this catastrophe, or how to delimit the miserable one that I had tried to form with so much pain and care? Its members were in proportion, and I had chosen its features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God!"
"When the time of departure approaches, Mrs. Morland's maternal anxiety will naturally be expected to be very severe. A thousand alarming presents of evil to her beloved Catherine of this wonderful separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together; and the advice of the most important and applicable nature must naturally spring out of her wise lips in their conference of separation in her closet. Attention to the violence of these nobles and baronets as the pleasure of forcing young ladies to a distant farm, must, at such a time, relieve the fullness of her heart. Who wouldn't think so? But Mrs. Morland knew so few lords and baronets, that she entertained no idea of their general ill luck, and was totally carefree of danger to her daughter from their machinations."
"Ms. Churchill, however, being old, and with full control of her fortune — although her fortune had no proportion with the family state — was not to be deterred from marriage, and it was to take place, at the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her with the desired decorum. It was an inappropriate bond, and did not produce much happiness. Mrs. Weston should have found more in her, for she had a husband whose warm heart and gentle temperament made him think of everything that was due to him in exchange for the great goodness of being in love with him; but although she had a kind of mind, she had not the best. She had enough resolution to pursue her own will despite her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets of the unreasonable anger of this brother, nor to miss the luxury of her old home."
"Mr. Bennet was one of the first to wait for Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, but until evening after the visit, he told him: ""I hope Mr. Bingley will love him, Lizzy."" ""We are not in a position to know what Mr. Bingley likes,"" said his mother, ""since we are not visiting."" ""But you forget, Mother,"" said Elizabeth, ""that we will meet him at the assemblies, and Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him."" ""I don't think Mrs. Long will do such a thing. She has two nieces to her. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I no longer have any opinion of her."" ""I have no more,"" said Mr. Bennet; ""and I am glad to see that you don't depend on her to serve you."""
"The first time, that you and I were dissensing in our opinion on any material issue, was after your arrival in Europe, and this point was the French Revolution. You were well convinced in your own mind that the Nation would succeed in establishing a free republican government: I was also convinced in mine that a project of such a government, more than five and twenty million people, when four and twenty million and five hundred thousand of them could not write or read: was as irrational and impassable as it would be on the Lions Tigers Panthers Wolves and Bears elephants in the Royal Household in Versailles. Napoleon recently invented a Word, which expresses my opinion perfectly at this time and since. He calls the Ideology of the Project. And John Randolph, although he was 14 years ago, as a savage an Enthusiast for Equality and Fraternity, like any of them; now seems to be a Regenerated Proselite to Napoleon Opinion and to me, that it was all madness."
"I was very satisfied with the freshness and presence of my son, because it showed me that I could count on him at any future opportunity where a real danger could occur. This time, however, no wild beast has rushed, but our trusted dog Turk, which we had forgotten, in our anxiety at the separation, and which had been sent after us without doubt by my thoughtful wife. I did not fail to greet both the bravery and the discretion of my son, by not even giving a rational alarm, and to wait for him to be sure of the object before he solved himself to the fire. However, from this little incident, we saw how dangerous our position was, and how difficult it would be to escape from any fierce beast that would fly us on the edge of the water: we hastened therefore to go to the sea. Here, the scene that was presented was really pleasant. A bottom of hills, the turbulent green grass, the pleasant groups of trees that lay here and there at the end of the water, we formed a beautiful one."
"The industry and the love of the truth alone will not make the artist. With only these Boswells could have simply been a tireless transcribed. But he also had an acute sense of artistic values. This appears in part in the unity of his vast work. Although it was years in progress, although the details that required his attention were innumerable, but they are all constantly centered on a figure, and are so focused on it, that one cannot open the book at random to a line that does not have its direct bearing on a single subject of the work. Nor is the unity of the book not that of a non-deviating narrative in the chronological order of a man's life; rather it develops from a single dominant personality exposed in all the vicissitudesitudes of a multiple career. Boswell often speaks of his work as a painting, a portrait, and of unique incidents such as images or scenes in a drama."
"Our work on the ground is carried out in a large plain or common, a few hours' walk from our homes, and all the neighbors hold themselves in a body. They do not use livestock, and their only instruments are hooves, axes, shovels and beaks, or iron pointed to dig. Sometimes we are visited by locusts, which come in large clouds, in order to darken the air, and to destroy our harvest. However, this happens rarely, but when it is the case, a famine is produced by it. I remember one or two examples where it happened. This common is often the scene of war; and therefore, when our people go to their land, they do not only go into a body, but usually take their arms with them for fear of a surprise; and when they apprehend an invasion, they keep the avenues of their homes, driving sticks in the ground, which are so sharp at one end to pierce the foot, and are usually soaked in poison."
"Experience probably teaches us that this object is constituted in such a way, but not that it could exist otherwise. First, if we have a proposal which contains the idea of necessity in its very conception, it is a priori. If, moreover, it is not derived from another proposal, unless it is absolutely a priori from a proposal which also involves the idea of necessity. Second, an empirical judgment never presents a strict and absolute universality, but only assumed and comparative (by induction); therefore, the most we can say is — as far as we have observed so far, there is no exception to this rule or to this rule. If, on the other hand, a judgment carries with it a strict and absolute universality, i.e. admits of no possible exception, it is not derived from experience, but is absolutely valid beforehand."
"When she came out of the club, the husband and the wife went home in silence. The tax collector went behind his wife, and looked down at her, sad, humiliated, little figure, and remembered the gaze of bliss that had so irritated her at the club, and the consciousness that the beatitude had gone to fill her soul with triumph. He was happy and satisfied, and at the same time he felt the lack of something; he would have liked to go back to the club and make everyone feel sad and miserable, so that everyone would know how stagnant and worthless life is when you walk in the streets in the dark and hear the mud under your feet, and when you know that you will wake up the next morning with nothing but vodka and cards. Oh, how terrible! And Anna Pavlovna could not walk.... She was still under the influence of dance, music, speech, lights, and noise; she wondered then why God had it so."
"In fact, I myself feel that this is the moment when the darkness of these two names — Ellis and Acton — was removed. The little mystery, which once gave a harmless pleasure, lost its interest; the circumstances are changed. It then becomes my duty to briefly explain the origin and author of the books written by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. About five years ago, my two sisters and I, after a period of a little prolonged separation, were found, and at home. Residents in a remote district, where education had progressed little, and where, therefore, there was no incentive to seek social relations beyond our own domestic circle, we were completely dependent on ourselves and on each other, on books and studies, for the pleasures and occupations of life."
"In the old legend of Rip Van Winkle with which the American writer Washington Irving has so familiar to us, the er-do-weel Rip walks in the mountains of Kaatskill with his dog and his rifle to escape his wife's ugly tongue. Here, he meets the spectre of the crew of Captain Hudson, and, after participating in their hospitality, falls into a deep sleep that lasts twenty years. The last part of the story describes the changes he finds when he returns to his native village: almost all the old familiar faces have gone away; manners, dress and speech are all changed. He feels like a stranger in a strange country. Now, it's a good thing to look back, to try to count on the changes for the good or evil that have taken place in our country; to try to understand clearly why the reign of a great queen should have left his mark on our history in such a way that men speak of Victoria's age as one of the greatest ages that have ever been."
"I got married early, and I was happy to find in my wife a disposition that was not inappropriate with mine. Observing my partiality for domestic animals, she did not lose the opportunity to get those of the most pleasant kind. We had birds, gold fish, a good dog, rabbits, a small monkey and a cat. The latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, completely black, and sagacious to an amazing degree. Speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who was not a little tinted with superstition, frequently referred to the old popular notion, which considered all black cats to be disguised witches."
"Our telescopes and our mathematical research assure us with all hands, without taking into account the cant of more ignorant of the priesthood, this space, and therefore this volume, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those that are best suited to evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of these bodies are precisely as, within a given surface, to include the greatest possible quantity of matter;—while the surfaces themselves are willing to accommodate a population denser than that which could be housed on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Neither any argument against the bulk being an object with God, this space itself is infinite; for there can be an infinite amount of material to fill it. And since we clearly see that the endowment of matter with vitality is indeed a principle, to the extent that our judgments extend, the guiding principle in Deity operations—it is hardly logical to imagine it limited to the regions of the minute, where we trace it daily, and not to those of August."
"Thus we lived alone, not knowing anything of the world without the valley, me, my cousin, and his mother. From the dark region beyond the mountains, to the upper end of our encircled domain, there was a narrow and deep river, brighter than all, except the eyes of Eleonora; and, sinuously around massic courts, she passed, in length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills still darker than those from which she had emitted. We called it the ""River of Silence""; for there seemed to be a moving influence in its flow. No murmuring rose up from her bed, and so gently he wandered, that the beaded pebbles on which we loved to look, far in her bosom, did not shake at all, but were embedded in an immobile content, each in his old station, resplendent glorarily forever."
"For months the place swam in the vapors. There were wonderful effects of sunrise and sunset, veils of scarmosis and gold, of every shade of blue and purple. Sometimes the grey lavender was like silver, the wet and black mud glowed like dark opals; while in summer there was a purple willow that thickened along the ditches, giving the strange place a transitory air of life warmly bloody; but for the most part, it was just as distant and detached as a sleep walker."
"The children were all incredibly sweet, and resolutely refused to be modeled on the ""pulls"", regardless of all the exhortations of their housekeepers and their mothers. They stripped the Christmas tree with the last sweet meat in the twinkling of an eye, and had managed to break half of the toys before they knew what was meant for what. Particularly charming was a boy with black eyes, with a curly head, who was trying to shoot me with his wooden rifle. But my attention was even more attracted by his sister, a girl of eleven, quiet, dreamy, pale, with great dream eyes, prominent, exquisite like a little Cupid. The children hurt her feelings in a certain way, and she was away from them in the same empty living room in which I was sitting, and played with her doll in the corner."
"The hope of entering the race for dramatic celebrity as an individual and unique attraction never came into my head before, in 1858, I acted Asa Trenchard in ""Our American cousin""; but as the curtain descended the first night on this remarkably successful game, great-type visions, foreign countries, and increased remuneration floated before me, and I decided to be a star if I could. A resolution to this effect is easily made; its fulfillment is quite another thing. Art has always been my love, and I loved it for itself. I had imagined that our affection was mutual, so when I failed like a star, which I certainly did, I thought she had dragged me. No. I wronged her. She only reminded me that I had taken too much freedom, and if I expected to win it I had to support my costume with more patience."
"The two mothers could not distinguish their own descendants from the lot, and as for the fathers, they were quite at sea. The eight names danced in their heads; they always mingled them; and when they wanted to call a child, the men often called three names before obtaining the good. The first of the two cottages, as you went up from the bathing beach, Rolleport, was occupied by the Tuvaches, who had three daughters and a boy; the other house housed the Vallins, who had a daughter and three boys. They all remained frustrated on soup, potatoes and fresh air. At seven o'clock in the morning, then at noon, then at six o'clock in the evening, the housewives had their broods together to give them their food, as the oieherds took charge. The children were seated, according to age, before the wooden table, varnished by fifty years of use; the mouths of the younger ones did not reach the level of the table."
"She did not have time to answer. The conductor, who had seized her by the arm to help her get up, pushed her inside, and she fell into a perplexed seat, looking through the back window at her husband's feet when he went up to the top of the vehicle. And she sat there still, between a big man who smelled cheap tobacco and an old woman who smelled garlic. All the other passengers were lined up in silence – an grocer's boy, a young girl, a soldier, a gentleman with gold glasses and a big silk hat, two ladies with self-satisfied and rabbe, who seemed to say, ""We go up in this thing, but we don't need it,"" two sisters of charity and an entrepreneur. They looked like a collection of caricatures."
"An elephant and a Crocodile were once standing by a river. They challenged the best animal. ""Look at my strength,"" said the elephant. ""I can tear a tree, roots, and everything with my trunk."" ""Ah! But the quantity is not of quality, and your skin is not as hard as mine,"" replied the Crocodile, ""for neither spear, nor arrow, nor sword can pierce it."" Just as they were blowing, a Lion is gone. ""Hey, gentlemen,"" said His Majesty, going up to them, ""let me know the cause of your quarrel."" ""Do you want to tell us what the best animal is?"" cried immediately. ""Certainly,"" said the Lion. ""See you that the soldier's steel helmet on the wall over there?"" pointed at the same time across the river. ""Yes,"" replied the beasts."
"""Once upon a time,"" said the sailor, the devil, and Davy Jones, arrived at Cardiff, at the place called Tiger Bay. ""They settled at Tony Adam's, not far from Pier Head, at the corner of Sunday Lane. And all the time they were passing there, they went to the rum shop, where they sat at a table, smoked their cigars, and divulged each other for different souls. Now, you must know that the devil gets from the earthmen, and Davy Jones becomes a sailor-folk; and they are tired of having the same, and then they get off for another kind of thing. Once they were in a place on Mary Street, having a burnt cognac, and playing red and black for the people who were passing by. And while they looked out on the street and turned the cards, they saw all the people on the sidewalk break their neck to get into the gout."
"A French writer recently published an attentive and interesting volume on the famous events that ended in the overthrow of Robespierre and the end of the Reign of the Terror. These events are known in the historical calendar as the Thermidor Revolution in Year II. After the fall of the monarchy, the Convention decided that the year should begin with the autumn equinox, and that the enumeration should date from the birth of the Republic. Year I opens on 22 September 1792; Year II opens on the same day of 1793. The month of Thermidor begins on 19 July. The ninth memorable Thermidor therefore corresponds to 27 July 1794. This was commonly taken as the date of the beginning of a counter-revolution, and in a sense it was. Count, however, and others preferred to fix the reaction to the execution of Danton (5 April 1794), or the official proclamation of the Deism of Robespierre in the Festival of the Supreme Being (7 May 1794)."
"Thus, the land stood long in great peril, for every lord and Baron sought his own advantage; and the Saxons, increasingly adventurous, wasted and invading the cities and villages in each part. Then Merlin went to Brice, the archbishop of Canterbury, and advised him to demand that all the Counts and Barons of the kingdom and all the knights and gentlemen of arms come to him before Christmas, under pain of curse, so that they might learn the will of heaven which was to be king. Therefore, the archbishop did this, and the Christmas Eve was met in London all the greatest princes, lords and barons; and long before day they prayed in the church of Saint Paul, and the archbishop begged heaven for a sign that was to be the legitimate king of the whole kingdom. And as they prayed, one saw in the garden of the church, planted directly before the doors of the church, a huge square stone having a naked sword trapped in the midst of him."
"The sugar cane seller looked at the other shrewdly. What were the gossip he had heard about Fa'ng, the famous old hachetman? Wasn't it that the old man was still hungry? Yes, that was it! Fa'ng, whose long knife and quick arm had been the most feared thing in all Chinatown, was hungry — too proud to beg, too honest to fly. ""You have eaten well, venerable Fa'ng?"" The investigation was in a relaxed, respectful tone. ""Aih, I ate well,"" replied the old hachetman, turning away his face. ""How unhappy for me! I haven't yet eaten my rice; for when we have to have dinner alone, we are going slowly to the table. Is it written that a bowl of rice shared is doubly appreciated? Wouldn't you have at least one cup of tea while I eat my average meal?"
"Astronauts have the oxygen they need to breathe. They have the water they need to drink. Astronauts put their space suits several hours before a walk into space. The combinations are pressurized. This means that the combinations are filled with oxygen. Once in their combinations, astronauts breathe pure oxygen for a few hours. Breathing only oxygen gets rid of all nitrogen in the body of an astronaut. If they do not get rid of nitrogen, astronauts could get gas bubbles in their bodies when they enter space. These gas bubbles can cause pain to the astronauts in their shoulders, elbows, wrists and knees."
"A Robonaut is a dexterous humanoid robot built and designed at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas. Our challenge is to build machines that can help humans work and explore in space. Working side by side with humans, or going where the risks are too great for people, Robonauts will expand our building and discovery capacity. At the heart of this effort is a capacity that we call dexterous manipulation, embodied in a ability to use one's hand to do work, and our challenge has been to build machines with a dexterity that exceeds that of an appropriate astronaut. There are currently four Robonauts, along with others in development. This allows us to study different types of mobility, control methods and task applications. The value of a humanoid on other designs is this ability to use the same workspace and tools — not only improves the efficiency of the types of tools, but also eliminates the need for specialized robotic connectors."
"The doctrine of the metempeything, or the transmigration of souls - a doctrine to which the above considerations are for the most part easy corollaries - pushes upwards in which direction we allow our thoughts to wander. And we encounter cases of transmigration of the body as well as of the soul. I do not mean that the body and the soul have transmigrated together, far from it; but that, as we can often recognize a spirit transmigrated into a foreign body, so we see no less often a body that is clearly but a transmigration, linked to a new and foreign soul of another. We meet every day people whose bodies are obviously those of men and women who have been dead for a long time, but whose appearance we know through their portraits."
"In one of his Latin letters written from Cambridge, Milton himself speaks of the ignorance of those conceived for the profession of divinity, how they knew little or nothing about literature and philosophy. The high prelacy and the ritual of Laud on the one hand, the Puritan movement on the other, in a certain way, a protest against this state of things, were in fierce contradiction with the other, and Milton's ear, from his youth upwards, was ""punished with noisy and ruinous noises."" Shakespeare's age was irremediably past, and it was impossible for some imperturbable cyrenics, like Herrick, to ""flatter time carelessly, as they did in the golden world."" Shakespeare's great indifference to current politics was impossible for Milton. ""I had also linked a brownist to a politician,"" says Sir Andrew Aguecheek's madness and Shakespeare's wisdom."
"As she spoke, she became very happy; and he appeared to her as if her desire were coming. Then she entered into the house, and a month passed, and the snow melted; and two months, and the ground was green; and three months, and the flowers went up from the earth; and four months, and all the trees in the wood burst forth, and the green branches grew together; and the little birds sang so that all the wood sounded, and the flowers fell from the trees. And the fifth month passed, and she stood under the junipertree, and felt so beautiful, and her heart leaped with joy. She fell on her knees, but could not speak. And the sixth month was gone, and the fruit was great and ripe, and she was very quiet; and in the seventh month she took the juniper berries, and ate them impatiently, and was sick and sad; and the eighth month passed, and she cried to her husband, and said, ""If I die, bury me under the juniper."""
"Once there was a little girl from a village, the prettiest one ever seen. Her mother loved her madly, and her grandmother the same. The old woman made her a little hood, which became so well the damsel, that after she had taken the name Little Red-Riding-Hood. One day, when her mother made cakes, she said, ""My child, you will go to your grandmother, for I hear that she is not well; and you will take her some of these cakes, and a pot of butter."" The little Red-Riding-Hood was delighted to go, even if it was a long walk; but she was a good child, and she loved her beautiful grandmother. Passing through a wood, she met a great wolf, who was most eager to eat it, but did not dare, because of a logger who was very busy."
"Then he went out with his only friends, his horse, and his faithful dog Cabriole; while all those who met him looked at him with compassion, pity for such a beautiful youth linked to such a desperate race. But, so kindly, they addressed him, Avenir went up and answered nothing, for he was too sad at heart. He reached a mountain, where he sat down to rest, letting his horse feed, and Cabriole run after the flies. He knew that the cave of darkness was not far away, but he looked at him who saw nothing. Finally, he perceived a rock, as black as ink, from which a thick smoke came; and at one moment appeared one of the two dragons, breathing flames. He had a yellow and green body, claws, and a long tail. When Cabriole saw the monster, the poor little dog hid himself in a terrible fear."
"Among his most beautiful portraits is that of ""Carmencita"", a Spanish dancer who, for a while, protected the world from pleasure. The list of his famous portraits is very long. Sargent's father was a doctor from Philadelphia, native to New England, but the artist himself was born in Florence. He received a good education and grew up with the beauties of Florence all around him, in a refined and charming house. He was the pleasure of his master, Carolus Durand, because he was modest and refined, but full of enthusiasm and energy. In his twenty-third year, he painted a beautiful image of his master. Sargent was a musician as well as a painter; a man of great versatility, as if the gods and all the muses had presided at his birth."
"Fortuny won his own occasion. He took a prize, while he was still very young, which allowed him to go to Rome where he wanted to study art. He did not spend his time studying and copying the old masters like most of the artists who were going there, but instead he studied the life of the Roman streets. He had already been at the Academy of Barcelona, but he did not follow his first master; instead, he struck a line of art for himself. After a year in Rome the artist went to war; but he did not go to fight men, he was always fighting fate, and his weapon was his sketch book. He went with General Prim, and he filled his book with warrior scenes and the brilliant skies of Morocco."
"The Italian painters received their names in a special way. This man's father was a tailor, and the artist was named after his father's profession. He was actually the ""Andrea de Tailor"", and his father's name was Angelo. A story of this brilliant painter who reads from first to last as a romance was told by the poet, Browning, who dresses the facts to stifle him a little, but there is the truth at the bottom. Andrea married a woman whom he loved tenderly. She had a beautiful face that seemed full of spirituality and feelings, and Andrea painted it again and again. The artist loved his work and always dreamed of the great things he had to do; but he was so in love with his wife that he depended on his smile for everything he had done, and his frunce plunged him into despair."
"When you use a credit card to buy things, instead of paying them immediately, each purchase goes on a large list. At the end of the month, the credit card company adds everything to the list together and sends you a single invoice for the total amount you spent that month. The particularity of credit cards is that you don't have to repay the entire invoice. Imagine that you spent $5,000 last month. When you get the invoice, you may just have to use your $1,000 to pay the invoice, but you still have every $5,000 of what you bought. It works like a loan because the credit card company has, roundedly, lent that amount over $4,000. As with a loan, you will still have to pay that $4,000 eventually, and the credit card company will charge you interest on it."
"Ellington started taking piano lessons at the age of seven. He didn't take the lessons very seriously or practice well in the early years. He often jumped his lessons in favour of baseball because he didn't think he was a good pianist. But at the age of fourteen, he started sneaking into music clubs and listening to professional pianists there. He developed a new passion for music. Soon, he wrote his first song, ""Soda Fountain Rag"", inspired by his work experiences in a soda shop. In high school, Ellington continued to take music lessons, and he imitated his favorite pianists to the ragtime. Every time he traveled with his family, he sought out famous local musicians for advice on his own music."
"People began to come to North America in the 1600s. These people were called settlers. They were from all over Europe, but most of the people came from England. Soon the British were the strongest influence in America. As a result, all the colonies became part of Great Britain. For some time, people liked to be part of a very great kingdom. This meant that they would be protected by a strong government. Then, in the mid-1700s, it changed. People began to get uncomfortable with how much power the king had. The biggest problem people had been how much money they paid in taxes. They sent the British a lot of money, but they could not be part of the government. This meant that they could not choose how their taxes were spent. Colonists began to say ""tax without representation"" to talk about the problem."
"In the 1920s, the U.S. had more rain than usual and agriculture was booming. New immigrants settled in the states of the Great Plains to try to start their own farms. However, they did not practice environmentally friendly agricultural techniques. They made two big mistakes. First, to plant as much wheat as possible, they ploughed on all the grasses of the prairies that kept the soil in place. Second, they too often planted crops, instead of giving the ground a break from time to time. As long as the rain continued to fall, none of these errors caused problems. But in 1930, the rain stopped coming. The soil became dry, loose and unable to support crops."
"The sun is a star, just like the other millions of stars you see when you look at the night sky. In fact, the sun is a relatively normal star. Like all stars, it is a big ball of gas that produces huge amounts of energy. The stars form when the particles floating in space are close to gravity, until the cloud of space dust is round and dense. Inside this dense center, hydrogen atoms are so under pressure that they merge into atoms of helium. This process is called nuclear fusion, and it releases a lot of extra energy in the forms of heat and light. Nuclear fusion is what keeps the stars on fire. 4.5 billion years ago, when the sun formed, it was not the only stacking of gas and dust that swirls around space."
"About ten o'clock the next morning, I was dragging myself along Portland Place, when a child passing by, towed by a nurse, threw a big pear, less a bite, into the gutter. I stopped, of course, and attached my desirable gaze on this muddy treasure. My mouth watered for it, my stomach coveted him, my whole being praying for her. But every time I made a gesture to get an eye of passage, I detected my goal, and of course I recovered, and I looked indifferent, and I claimed that I had not thought of the pear at all. This same thing happened and happened, and I couldn't get the pear. I was just desperate enough to brave all the shame, and grab it, when a window behind me was up, and a gentleman spoke about it, saying, ""Enter, please."""
"I was ashamed, and also lost; and it was by wandering through the woods to drive away that I found a cabin in desert logs and that I ate one of the best meals that I ate in my days of life. The garden cultivated in weeds was full of ripe tomatoes, and I ate them in a refreshing way, even if I had never loved them before. No more than two or three times since I tasted something that was so delicious as these tomatoes. I caught myself with them, and I only tasted another one until I was in average life. I can eat them now, but I don't like the look of them. I guess we've all been surfing at some point or another. Once, in the stress of the circumstances, I ate part of a barrel of sardines, there's nothing else at hand, but since then, I've never been able to get along without sardines."
"The widow she wept over me, called me a lost poor lamb, and she called me many other names, too, but she never wanted to hurt me. She put me back in new clothes, and I could only do sweat and sweat, and she called me many other names. Well, then the old thing started again. The widow rang a bell for supper, and you had to come to the time. When you came to the table, you couldn't go straight to eat, but you had to wait for the widow to sneak her head and grow a little bit on the victuals, although there isn't really anything with them, that is, nothing else was cooked by herself. In a barrel of ribs and ends, it's different; things are mixed, and the kind of juice is better."
"We moved west toward the middle of the afternoon over a watery and sparkling summer sea; a seductive sea, a clean and fresh sea, and apparently a welcoming sea for all on board; it was certainly for me, after the dusty dust, smoke and wipers of the last weeks. The trip would provide a three-week vacation, with barely a break in it. We had the entire Pacific Ocean in front of us, without doing anything but doing and being comfortable. Victoria was shining in the deep heart of its smoke cloud, and was preparing to disappear and now we would close the country glasses and sit on our happy and peaceful steam chairs. But they went to the wreck and to the ruin under us and made us ashamed in front of all the passengers. They had been furnished by Victoria's largest furniture house, and we deserved a few stuffings a dozen, although they cost us the price of honest chairs."
"I didn't make a cent on the burglary alarms, Mr Twain — not a cent — and I'm going to tell you why. When we finished our house, we found that there was some money left, because the plumber didn't know it. I was to enlighten the pagans with her, because I was always incompetent about the pagans in one way or another; but Mrs McWilliams said no, we have a burglary alarm. I accepted this compromise. I'm going to explain that whenever I want something, and Mrs McWilliams wants something else, and we decide what Mrs McWilliams wants — as we always do — she calls this compromise. Very well: the man came from New York and put in the alarm, and charged three hundred and twenty-five dollars for her, and we said that we could sleep smoothly now."
"From the junction of Ohio to a half point to the sea, the average width of a mile in high water: from there to the sea, the width decreases steadily, until, above the mouth, it does not exceed half a point. At the junction of Ohio, the depth of the Mississippi is eighty-seven feet; the depth gradually increases, reaching one hundred and twenty-nine just above the mouth. The difference of ascent and fall is also remarkable, not at the top, but at the bottom of the river. The climb is tolerably uniform up to Natchez (three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth) – about fifty feet. But at Bayou La Fourche, the river rises only twenty-four feet; at New Orleans only fifteen, and just above the mouth only two and half."
"Once upon a time an artist had painted a small and very beautiful image placed it so that he could see it in the mirror. He said, ""It doubles the distance and softens it, and it is twice as beautiful as it was before."" The animals out in the woods heard about it by the house cat, who was greatly admired by them because it was so learned, and so refined and civilized, and so polite and high, and could tell them so much that they did not know before, and were not certain of the afternoon. They were very excited about this new piece of gossip, and they asked questions, to get a full understanding of it. They asked what an image was, and the cat explained. ""It's a flat thing, he said; wonderfully flat, wonderfully flat, enchantingly flat and elegant. And, oh, so beautiful!"" It excited them almost to a frenzy, and they said they would give the world to see it."
"There is a sumptuous variety about the time of New England that forces the stranger to admire — and regret. Time always does something about it; always strictly dealing with business; always getting up new drawings and trying them on people to see how they will go. But it goes through more business in the spring than in any other season. In the spring, I counted one hundred thirty-six different kinds of time in four and twenty hours. I was the one who made the fame and fortune of the man who had this wonderful collection of time on display at the Centenary, who so surprised the strangers. He was going to travel around the world and get specimens from all the climates. I told him, ""Do not do it; come to New England just on a favorable spring day."" I told him what we could do in style, variety, and quantity. Well, he came, and he made his collection in four days."
"We went to a multitude of bushes, and Tom made everyone swear to keep the secret, and we showed them a hole in the hill, just in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we went up the candles, and we crawled on our hands and on our knees. We went about two hundred meters, and then the cave opened. Tom began in the middle of the passages, and soon we escaped under a wall where you would not have noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and went into a kind of room, all wet and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom said, ""Now we will start this band of thieves and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang. All those who want to join must swear, and write his name in the blood."" Everyone was ready."
"The two boys stopped on the road about half a mile from the borders of Bloomsbury where they lived. From where they were standing, holding their fishing rods, and a fairly decent catch of fine prices, they could look on the beautiful surface of Sunrise Lake, which was more than fifteen miles long, and in places as much as three or four wide. ""Mebbe you can tell me, Larry,"" the little boy currently said, ""just why Frank continues to navigate around the lake this way? Suppose he takes pictures of his biplane?"" That could be, Elephant,"" Larry replied, slowly and thoughtfully. ""Looks like me, I've heard someone talk about the state wanting to get a map of the lake, with all its many coves and dots. But isn't it more dangerous for the airmen who drag over the water than the shore?"" ""It depends,"" notes the other boy, whose real name was Fennimore Cooper Small, and who was pretty much fit to have an idea of his own, as if it were a very important person."
"""Mollie Thurston, we are lost!"" cried Barbara. The two sisters were in the depth of a New Jersey wood one afternoon at the beginning of September. ""Well, what we are!"" laughed Mollie, leaning to add a group of wild asters to her great group of gold sticks. ""We have two hours ahead of us. Certainly wooden men as intelligent as we can find our way out of the woods that are a few miles away from us. Suppose we should explore a real forest one day. Wouldn't it be too heavenly! Come, lazy Barbara! We will arrive at a clearing in a few moments. ""You lack sympathy, Miss Mollie Thurston; that's your problem."" Barbara laughed, but she was impatiently scanning the swampy terrain as she chose. ""I wouldn't want to be lost in these woods a little more than you, if I wasn't so terribly afraid of snakes. Oh, my! this place is full of them."""
"""Donate the call of the assembly, number three!"" Currently, in response to Paul's order, the clear and soft notes of a bugle sounded through the great gymnasium under the church. More than twenty boys of all sizes began to pass from the outside, where they had chatted like so many pees; for it was now summer, with a holiday at hand. After telling the bugler to ring the call to the meeting, Paul, who often had the charge in place of the regular Scoutmaster, Mr. Gordon, looked at the boys' arrival through the open door of the basement. ""Everybody in hand tonight, I suppose, Paul,"" observed his fellow Jack, while he placed his hand on the shoulder of the leader of the Red Fox Patrol. So far there were three patrols in the Stanhope troop. As the first to organize had chosen to be known as the Red Fox, it was pleasing to others simply to call their patrols by the names of Gray and Renard Noir."
"Peter Rabbit was perplexed. He looked at Lightfoot the Deer a little suspicious. ""Have you torn someone's coat?"" he asked again. He didn't like the thought of Lightfoot, which he had always believed to be just as gentle, harmless and shy as himself. But what else could he think? Lightfoot shook his head slowly. ""No,"" he said, ""I didn't tear anyone's coat."" ""What are these rags hanging on your wood?"" asked Peter. Lightfoot splashed. ""They are what's left of the covers of my new wood,"" he explained. ""What do you mean by new wood?"" Peter was sitting very straight, with his eyes fixed on the woods of Lightfoot as if he had never seen them before. ""Just what I said,"" replied Lightfoot. ""What do you think of them?"
"""I don't know my tutor. Five years ago, I spent a week with him. I don't remember much of it, except that he lives in a beautiful house, and he has a lot of servants. Since, as you know, I spent most of my time here, except in the summer I was allowed to board the Catskills or any country I could choose."" ""Yes, and I remember a year that you took me with you and paid all my expenses. I'll never forget your kindness, and how much I enjoyed it this summer."" Rodney Ropes smiled, and his smile usually made his face look very serious. ""My dear David,"" he said, ""it was all selfish of me. I knew that I had to have much better fun with a companion."" ""You can call this selfishness, Rodney, but it's a kind of selfishness that makes me your dedicated friend. How long do you think I stay in school?"""
"In Knob Creek, the boy started to go to a ""A B C"" school. His first teacher was Zachariah Riney. Of course, there were no regular schools in the backwoods then. When a man who ""was quite familiar"" came with him, especially if he had nothing else to do, he tried to teach pioneer children in a poor roundwood school. It is not likely that little Abe went to school more than a few weeks at that time, because he had never had a year of schooling in his life. There was another teacher after that in Knob Creek — a man named Caleb Hazel. He is little known to one of these teachers except that he taught little Abe Lincoln. If their student had not become famous the men and their schools would never have been mentioned in the story. An old man, named Austin Gollaher, liked to tell the days when he and little Abe went to school together."
"In the same city where Sebastian was born, stands at the top of a hill a very famous castle built hundreds of years ago. This castle is called the Wartburg. As a little boy Sebastian used to climb the hill with his friends, and they, no doubt, had a pleasure to play on the grounds of the castle. In one of his large halls, the German minstrels held their singing contests. When Sebastian was old enough he used to travel on foot, as the minstrels did; his goal was to go hear beautiful organ players. Once he was tired by the road, someone threw him a herring so that he could eat as he was resting. Petit Sebastian's father was named Johan Ambrosius Bach. He was also a musician, as his people had been for many years. One of them was a miller who played and sang while the corn was grinding. His name was Veit Bach, and his little boy was called Hans, the Player, because he liked to play the violin."
"Ludwig was only four years old when he began to study music. Like the children of today, he shed a lot of tears on the first lessons. At first his father taught him piano and violin, and forced him to practice. At school, he learned, as we do today, reading, writing, arithmetic, and later Latin. Never after thirteen years, Ludwig did not go to school because he had to work and earn a living. You wonder what kind of boy he was? We are told that he was shy and calm. He spoke little and did not care about the games that his boys' and girls' companions played. While Ludwig was at school, he was playing for the first time at a concert. He was then eight years old. Two years later, he had composed a number of plays."
"A great violinist, Ole Bull by his name, visited the Grieg family in the country. He was so kind to the little composer that the boy just loved him. Ole Bull went around the world playing the violin. He looked at Edvard's compositions and made him play the boy. You can see him hoaching his head with pleasure while listening. His beautiful eyes are illuminated. He tells the boy composer that his music is good enough, but there are many things to learn from him. He must study seriously and make many sacrifices. Then Ole Bull sits down and speaks with Father and Mother Grieg. It is a serious conversation, as you can see. Finally, when the speech is over, Ole Bull takes the curious boy by the hand and tells him: ""You go to Leipzig to study and become a good musician."""
"One day, when little George was seven years old, his father went to see another son, who was at the service of the Duke of Saxony-Weissenfels. The little boy begged his father to let him go. ""No,"" he replied, ""you are too young to go so far."" However, when the coach also walked, George Frederick went on foot, and he would not be sent home. He continued to go as fast as his little feet would go. Everyone hoped that he would be tired and return, but finally the father had to order the coach to stop and take him away. Thus, he showed this determination that helped him all his life. Arrived at the castle, the boy soon made friends with the musicians in the chapel. They took him to the organ loft, where he played for them. All were delighted with his talent. One day, the Duke himself heard him play."
"One day, Richard Wagner's operas will give you great pleasure. At first, they were not loved by the public. Wagner had few friends and his life was very hard. But Franz Liszt believed in him and in his work. So he helped him. At the beginning Wagner didn't like Liszt. He once said, ""I never repeated my first call to Liszt."" By this, he wanted him to finish the knowledge. When Liszt realized that Wagner didn't care about understanding him, he did his best to keep friendship safe. Liszt never wanted to misunderstand another human being. So it didn't take long before Wagner's opinion on Liszt changed, because he later said, ""By the love of this rarest friend, I won a real home for my art."" There's one thing true to all of us."
"When Wolferl was almost six years old, his father took him and Nannerl on a concert tour. Everyone wanted to hear them play and they gave many concerts. Wolferl spent all his youth with his music. He went to many places to play, even as far away from Salzburg, Austria (where he was born), as in Paris and London. Wherever he went, people were happy to see him and hear them play. And they too, they were happy to play because they loved music so much. When they reached Vienna, they played for the Emperor and the Empress. When Wolferl was introduced to the Empress, he jumped on his knees and kissed him. Wolferl was always busy composing music."
"Franz's father was a schoolmaster, and Franz himself was a teacher for three years. He taught Vienna's little children their A-B-C, and how to make money. Of course, he helped them learn how to read. Sometimes we had trouble taking a piano or violin lesson a week. But from the moment Franz Schubert was a very little boy, he had lessons every week for violin, voice and piano. A little later, he started studying harmony with a very famous man who knew Mozart. His name was Antonia Salieri With so many lessons and with the school work as we did, Franz had to be a very busy boy. He was quite poor and often very hungry; but despite that he was still good nature and full of pleasure. At eleven years old, he became a singer in the chapel of the Emperor. This is where Salieri was director."
"Whenever the organist arrived in the village of Roncole, Italy (where Verdi was born, October 10, 1813), he could not be kept inside. But he followed the wonderful organ and the wonderful man who played it, all day long, as happy as he could be. When Giuseppe was seven years old, his father, although only a poor innkeeper, bought him an epinet, a sort of small piano. So faithfully the little boy practiced that the thorn was soon very worn out and new jacks, or hammers, had to be made for him. This was done by Stephen Cavaletti, who wrote a message on one of the jacks saying that he was making them new and covering them with leather, and fixed the pedal, doing everything for nothing, because the little boy, Giuseppe Verdi, showed such a willingness to practice and learn."
"The day Richard Wagner was born was May 22, 1813. It was more than a century ago! More than twelve hundred months ago! Music has changed a lot. When Wagner was born, much of the music that was written had to follow certain models or models as architects follow certain models in the construction of a house. Now, the composer when he writes the music feels much freer because he knows that he can make his own models, that he is not bound by laws as hard as those that have retained composers such as Mozart, Bach, Haydn and Handel. It is Wagner who has done much to free the music from the old barriers. This does not mean that music today is better than music that was written by Haydn and Beethoven. Indeed, it is not often so good, but it is more freer, less retained by the rule."
"On a Saturday afternoon, in January, a group of animated boys gathered on the west side of a large pond in the village of Groveton. Among them was a tall and pleasant young man of twenty-two years, the school teacher of the Grammar Centre, Frederic Hooper, A.B., a recent graduate of Yale College. Obviously, there was something important on foot. What one can learn from the words of the teacher. ""Now, boys,"" he said, holding in his hand a Waterbury watch, of a neat pattern, ""I offer this watch as a prize to the boy who will skate through the pond and in the least time. You will all start together, at a given signal, and make your way to the mark I placed at the western end of the lake, skate around, and return to that point."
"Patriotism, or love of the country, is one of the tests of nobility of character. No great man has ever lived who was not a patriot in the highest and most true sense. From the first time, the feeling of patriotism was aroused in the hearts of men by the narrative of heroic acts inspired by the love of the country and the love of freedom. This truth provides the key to the arrangement and method of the present work. The ten epochs treated are those that were potential to shape subsequent events; and when men struck blows for human freedom against risks and regardless of personal consequences. The simple narrative bears its own morals, and the most profitable work for the teacher will simply be to complete the narrative so that the image presented is all the more vivid."
"The Goban was the master of sixteen trades. There were no blows, he had the gift. He went once to Quin Abbey when he was building, in search of a job, and the men went to their dinner, and he had poor clothes, and they began to jibe on him, and the foreman said, 'Now make a cat-and-nine cocks while we are at our dinner, if you are good.' And he took the scissor and cut it in the hard in the stone, a cat with nine tails that came from him, and it was complete when they came out of their dinner. There was no kicking. He had no trade, but he was master of sixteen."
"They have kangaroos rats and dogs of the jackal genus, all exactly the same; and a small animal of the tribe of bears, named the belly, but the largest quadruped discovered at the present time is the kangaroo. These almost complete the catalog of animals with four feet still known on this vast island. However, there is an animal that looks nothing like anything in creation but does not belong to the beast, the bird or the fish. This animal is called the duck's beaked Platypus. Of all the quadrupeds still known, this seems the most extraordinary in its conformation; showing the perfect appearance of a duck's beak on the head of a quadruped. The head is flat, and rather small than large; the mouth or muzzle resembles so exactly that of some species of duck with wide beak, that it could be confused for one. Birds and fish are no less singular than the animals. There is a singular fish, which, when left uncovered by the short-sighted tip of the tide."
"Most of the cities, and even most of the largest villages, of ancient Egypt, have been walled. It was almost a necessary consequence of the geographical characteristics and political constitution of the country. The mouths of the sepulchres that led in the desert were to be closed against the Bedawin; while the great feudal nobles fortified their houses, their cities and villages on their estates which controlled either the mountain passes, or the narrow parts of the river, against their king or their neighbours. The oldest fortresses are those of Abydos, El Kab, and Semneh. Abydos contained a sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, and was located at the entrance of one of the roads leading to the Oasis. As the fame of the temple attracted pilgrims, so the position of the city made it frequent by the merchants; hence the prosperity it drew from the influx of the two classes of foreigners exposed the city to incursions of the Libyan tribes."
"Although Greece (or Hel'las) is only half as large as the state of New York, it occupies a very important place in the history of the world. It is located in the southern part of Europe, cut off from the rest of the continent by a chain of high mountains that form a large wall to the north. It is surrounded by almost all sides by the blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea, which extend so far inside that it is said that no part of the country is forty miles from the sea, or ten miles from the hills. Thus, closed by the sea and the mountains, it forms a small territory on its own, and it was the home of a well-known people. The history of Greece dates back to the time when people could not write, and did not record what was happening around them."
"We crossed the sloped rocky plain to the base of the mountain, and we discovered a path that led a wooded shoulder to the right of the main peaks. An hour of constant climbing took us to the top of the ridge where we hit in the woods towards a snowfield on the opposite slope. The trail led us along the edge of an abrupt escarpment from where we could look over the valley and far in the blue distance towards Li-chiang. Three thousand feet below us the roof of our temple slipped from the middle of the sheltering pines, and the flocks of sheep and cattle gathered in mobile plots on the smooth brown plain. We pushed our way through the spruce forest with the bright snowbed as a beacon and suddenly emerged in a flat and open meadow overshadowed by the razed peaks."
"Over the next three generations, the political and social elements of Roman civilization in Britain seem to have disappeared. A few words, such as ""port"" and ""rue"", which may or may not be derived from Latin, have come down to us. But there was nothing, of which we can speak with absolute certainty, except the material shell, the walls, the roads, the forts, the villas, the arches, the doors, the altars and the tombs, whose ruins are still visible scattered throughout the country. The ground, also, is filled with relics of the same kind. Twenty feet below the surface of today's London are the remains of the London of the Romans. By digging in the ""city"", the shovel of the worker from time to time and then brings pieces of carved stone with Latin inscriptions, pieces of rusty armor, broken swords, fragments of statues, and ornaments of gold and silver."
"The original compass was composed of a cup full of water, on which a thin circular board floated, the needle resting on it; it was placed in a small sanctuary or temple in front of the helmsman, with a lantern probably fixed inside to illuminate the mysterious instrument during the night. The most formidable oaths were given to the initiates not to disclose the secret. Also, all the means that craft could conceive or superstition force was used by the Phoenicians to prevent other people from acquiring knowledge of it, or the way in which their trade beyond the Strait of Hercules was carried on, or currents, winds, tides, seas, shores, people, ports. A story is told of a Phoenician ship heading on the rocks to prevent the Romans from finding the passage. This secret was applied by the bloodiest code – death was the penalty of indiscretion; thus the secret of the compass was preserved from generation to generation among some families of unknown civils."
"The public buildings and gardens were worthy of Europe's first city. With some travellers of today are familiar. The largest number of the remarkable churches that were standing today were in existence before the Revolution. Palaces then in the city, the three most famous met with varied destinies. Luxembourg, which was the residence of the king's older brother, is the least changed. For the building itself but small additions were made. Its garden was and is a quiet and orderly place where respectable family groups sit around the shadow. The Louvre was greatly enlarged. Under Louis XVI. it consisted of the buildings surrounding the eastern courtyard, a wing extending towards the river (the Apollo Gallery), and a long gallery, since rebuilt, running near the shore and connecting this older palace with the Tuileries. About half of the space now closed between the two sides of the huge building, and known as Place du Carrousel, was then covered with houses and streets."
"The old laws and customs, which vary according to the provinces, have been swept away, so that the field was clear; and the system of government that Napoleon designed has remained virtually unchanged since that time. Everything has been done to depend on the central government. The ministers of religion, justice, police, education, etc., have the regulation of all internal affairs, and name all those who work under them, so that no one learns to act alone; and since the government has always depended on the will of the people of Paris, the whole country is powerless in their hands. The army, as in almost all foreign nations, is raised by conscription, that is, by drawing lots among the young people who can serve, and who can only escape by paying a substitute for them; and this is usually the first object of saving a family."
"On the basis of previous comparisons, some writers attempt to temporarily trace the history of the tradition of flooding among the peoples of South-West Asia. A fragment of the history of the Babylonian flood, coming at least from 2000 BC, has been discovered recently. The probability is that the tradition goes back to the early beginnings of Babylonian history. The setting up of the biblical accounts of the flood is also the Tigris-Euphrates Valley rather than Palestine. The description of the construction of the ark in Genesis 6:14-16 is not only closely parallel to that found in the Babylonian story, but the method – the disentanglement of the ark inside and without bitumen – is unique to the Tigris-Euphrates Valley. Many scholars therefore believe that Babylonia was the original home of the history of the biblical flood. Its exact origin, however, is not so certain. Many of its details have undoubtedly been suggested by the annual floods and the corresponding fogs that flooded this famous valley so early."
"If we could see in a magical mirror the country now called Scotland as it was when the Romans under Agricola (81 A.D.) crossed the border, we should recognize little but the hills and the familiar mountains. The rivers, in the plains, overflowed their current shores; dense forests of oaks and pines, haunted by large red deer, elk and wild boar, covered land that has long been arable. There were lakes and lagoons where corn fields had been in place for centuries. At the oldest sites in our cities were groups of clay huts and lambs, and perhaps dominated by the large house stored by the tribal prince."
"The rocks of Wales are older and harder than the rocks of the plains; and when you travel from south to north, the rocks are older and harder than they are. The highest mountains of Wales and some of its hills have ridges of the oldest and hardest rocks — granite, porphyry and basalt; and these rocks are given by fire; but most of the country is made up of rocks formed by water — even the oldest of their kind. In the northwest, in the centre and in the west — about two thirds of the country, the rocks are mainly slate and shale; in the southeast, they are mainly old red sand stones; in the northeast, but especially in the south, they are limestone and coal. Its rocks give Wales its famous landscape — its rugged peaks, romantic glands, flowing rivers."
"The history of British North America in the quarter century after the War of 1812 is in the main history of pioneering life. Slowly few clearings in the vast forest were enlarged and gained to order and abundance; slowly the community was linked to the community; and from the growing relationships there developed the complex of ways and habits and interests that constitute the daily life of a people. All the provinces called settlers, and they did not call in vain. For a time the northern part of New England continued to overflow in the townships of eastern Lower Canada, the hilly lands south of the St. Lawrence that had been left untouched by the lord and inhabitant bordered by river."
"In addition, the 1889 Revolution had been carried out by a combination of army officers and civilian amateurs who knew that the provinces were ready for a radical change of form of government, but who were wise enough to do it slowly. If a motto could mean something, the adoption of the positivist system, ""Order and Progress"", displayed on the national flag seemed a happy august. The constitution promulgated in 1891 created a federal union largely similar to that of the United States, except that the powers of the general government were somewhat more restricted. The qualifications for suffrage were directly fixed in the fundamental law itself, but the educational tests imposed excluded the vast majority of the population from the right to vote. Also, in the constitution, the Church and the state were declared absolutely separate, and civil marriage was prescribed."
"Finally, they managed to jump logs, not to the shore, but to a small island in the river. There, they were very little better than on the raft. They were on land, it is true, but there was still no way to get to the shore; and since there was nothing on the island to make a fire with, Washington was forced, soaked as it was with ice water, to spend the long winter night in the open air, without as much as a small blaze or a handful of coals by which to warm up. Unfortunately, the night turned out very cold, and poor Gist's feet and hands were frozen before morning. Washington had no ice, but his sufferings had to be great. During the night the part of the stream that was between the island and the shore that Washington wanted to reach frozen, and in the morning the travellers could renew their journey."
"The leader of this expedition was Thorstein Ericsson, a good and intelligent man, and blessed many friends. Eric was also invited to join them, because the men believed that his luck and foresight would be of great help. He was slow to decide, but did not say no, when his friends begged him to go. They then equipped this ship in which Thorbiorn had come out, and twenty men were selected for the expedition. They took little cargo with them, did not save their weapons and provisions. That morning, when Eric left his home, he took with him a small chest containing gold and silver; he hid this treasure, and then went to his way."
"Squanto taught men how to plant fry or herring as fertilizer for Indian corn. He taught boys and girls how to pick clams and mussels on the shore and to ""treat eels"" in the water that is still called Eel River. He collected wild strawberries and sassafras for women and they prepared a ""brew"" that almost matched their old England ale. The friendly Indians helped men, as the seasons opened, to hunt wild turkeys, ducks and a casual deer, welcome additions to the fish, biscuits and cheese store. We are told that Squanto also brought a dog of his Indian friends as a gift to the colony. There were already, at least, two dogs, probably brought from Holland or England, a mastic and a spagneel to give comfort and companionship to women and children, and to go with men in the woods for wood and game."
"Now, the chair in which grandfather was sitting was in oak, which had become dark with age, but had been rubbed and polished until it shined as bright as mahogany. It was very large and heavy and had a back that rose high above grandfather's white head. This back was curiously carved in an open work, in order to represent flowers and foliage and other devices, which the children had often looked at, but could never understand what they meant. On the very tip of the chair, above grandfather's head itself, was a resemblance of the lion's head, which had such a wild smile that you almost expected to hear him growling and snarl. The children had seen Grandfather sitting in that chair since they could remember anything. Perhaps the youngest of them assumed that he and the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been as old as they were now."
"After getting the seal, Dr. Kane and his men traveled. Sometimes they were on the ice. Sometimes they were in the boats. The men were so weak that they could not row the boats. They were so hungry that they could not sleep well at night. One day they rowed, when they heard a noise. He came to them through the water. He did not sound like the cry of the seabirds. It sounded like the voices of people. ""Listen,"" said Dr. Kane to Petersen. Petersen spoke the same language as the people of Greenland. He listened. The sound came back. Petersen was so happy that he could not speak. He said to Kane in a half whisper, that it was the voice of someone speaking his own language. It was a few Greenland men in a boat. The next day they arrived in a city of Greenland."
"Lincoln died martyr to the cause to which he had given his life, and life and death were heroic. The qualities that enabled him to do his great work are now very clear to all men. His courage and wisdom, his deep perception and his almost prophetic vision, enabled him to face all the problems of this time distracted as they arose around him. But he had some qualities, besides those of the intellect, which were of equal importance to his people and to the work that he had to do. His character, both strong and gentle, gave everyone confidence, and dignity to his cause. He had infinite patience, and humour that allowed him to divert many difficulties that could not have been encountered in any other way. But the most important thing was that he personified a great feeling, which ennobled and raised his people, and made them capable of patriotism that fought war and saved the Union."
"In the morning, he left his faithful horse attached to a fence, completely broken. He then began his sad journey on foot — cold and hungry — in a strange place, where it was dangerous enough to make his condition known and wants. Thus, for a day or two, without food or shelter, he travelled until his feet were literally exhausted, and in this state he arrived at Harrisburg, where he found friends. Passing on many interesting incidents on the road, it is enough to say, he arrived safely in that city, on New Year's night, 1857, about two hours before the break of the day (the telegraph having announced his arrival from Harrisburg), having been a week on the way. The night he arrived was very cold; moreover, the subway, that morning, was about three hours late; pending, entirely in the cold, a member of the Vigilance Committee thought he was frozen."
"A military life had no charm for me, and I didn't have the weakest idea of staying in the army even if I had to graduate, which I didn't expect. The camp that preceded the start of university studies was very weary and uninteresting. When August 28 came – the date of the breakup of the camp and the entrance into the barracks – I felt as if I had always been at West Point, and if I had stayed at graduation, I had to stay always. I didn't take my studies greedily, in fact I never read a lesson the second time throughout my cadet position. I couldn't sit in my room doing nothing. There's a beautiful library linked to the Academy from which cadets can get books to read in their neighborhoods. I spent more time on these, than books related to the course of studies."
"The Pony Express was the first fast passage and fast mail line across the continent from Missouri to the Pacific coast. It was a system by which messages were transported quickly on horseback across the plains and deserts, and on the mountains of the far west. It brought the Atlantic coast and the Pacific slope ten days closer to each other. It had a brief existence of only sixteen months and was replaced by the transcontinental telegraph. Yet, it was of the utmost importance to link East and West together at a time when land travel was slow and cumbersome, and when a great national crisis made the news quickly between these sections a necessity. The Pony Express marked the highest development of land travel before the arrival of the Pacific Railway, which it preceded nine years."
"The forests were now painted in all the glorious autumn. All the creatures of the woods moved away from the drowsy laziness of the summer and descended from the highlands in search of a winter den. Moose and deer were in motion. Beaver came to burst down to plaster their houses before the frost. Bears and lynx and marten, all were agitated like the instinctive autumn winds with the coming storm. This is the season when the Indian began to hunt and fight. Furnished with clothing, food and firearms, Radisson left the Mohawk valley with three hunters. In mid-August, the birch crust was in perfect condition to peel."
"The explorers were about to dive into vast solitudes of which the whites knew less than we know today in the polar country of the North. Wild and extravagant stories of what was to be seen in these inopportune areas were circulating in the United States. For example, it was said that Lewis and Clark expected to find the mammoths of the prehistoric era that were still living and wandering in the area of Upper Missouri; and it was commonly reported that somewhere, about 1,000 miles on the river, was a solid mountain of rocky salt, eighty miles long and forty-five miles wide, bare of vegetation and glitter in the sun! These, and other tales like these, were supposed to be believed and tamed by the great Jefferson himself. The federalists, or ""Feds,"" as they were called, who hated Jefferson, claimed to believe that he had invented some of these stupid sons, hoping to make his purchase of Louisiana more popular in the Republic."
"Among the wonders of San Francisco, it is worth mentioning the Palace Hotel, a structure of immense size and probably two or three times larger than the average man of the East. The hotel site covers a space of more than one acre and half, and several million dollars have been spent on this structure. Everything is magnificent, expansive, huge and massive. The building itself is seven stories high, and in its center, forming what can be described as the largest closed courtyard in the world, is a circular space of 144 feet across and covered with glass at a great height. The transports are driven in this enclosure, and, in the closest approach to the violent times known in San Francisco, the guests can light up almost inside. There are nearly 800 bedrooms, all large and high, and the general style of the architecture is more than massive. The foundation walls are 12 feet thick, and 31 million bricks have been used above them."
"The North was not really ready for a determined war, indeed, until later in the year. Meanwhile, many were moralizing in the British press about the revelation of Bull Run of military weakness of the North. Probably the most influential statements of the current newspaper were the letters of W.H. Russell to the Times. This famous war correspondent had been sent to America in the spring of 1861 by Delane, editor of the Times, his first letter, written on 29 March, appearing in the issue of April 16. He travelled across the South, was met everywhere with a greedy courtesy like a man of his reputation and a representative of the most important organ of British public opinion, returned to the North at the end of June, and in Washington received intimate talks by Seward and other leaders."
"Not only was the Titanic the largest steamboat, but it was the most luxurious. Carefully furnished cabins opened on its eleven bridges, and some of these bridges were reserved as private walks that were engaged with the best suites. One of these suites was sold for $4350 for the young girl of the boat and only the trip. Similar suites, but which were without private walk bridges, sold for $2300. The Titanic differed in some respects from its sister ship. The Olympic has a lower walk bridge, but in the case of the Titanic the state rooms were exited with the outside of the superstructure, and the rooms themselves made much larger. The sitting rooms of some of the suites on this bridge were 15 x 15 feet. The restaurant was much larger than that of the Olympic and it had a novelty in the form of a private walk bridge on the starboard side, to be used exclusively by its bosses."
"The old Commonwealth of Massachusetts, having terrible war debts to pay after the Revolution, had nothing but land in Maine to pay for it. Now, the land of Maine was not very dirty, and, if the simple and ordinary process of selling had been followed, the land could not have been sold to this day. Thus, it was distributed by these lotteries which, at that time, seemed gigantic. Each ticket holder had a piece of land that had been allocated to him, I think, — but for the most part, I fear, the land was not worth it, to settle down. But, to encourage as many people to buy as possible, there were prices."
"Alice MacNeil had made the plan of this Christmas tree, all alone and for herself. She had an adequate estimate of the made trees that worked hard ""Sabbath schools"" rise for merit rewards for the children who were regular, and at the last moment saved the attendance tickets enough. Alice MacNeil did not sit in judgment on them. She had an appropriate estimate of them. But for her Christmas tree she had two plans not included in these more meritorious buds and buds of the winter. First, she wanted to stand up without any help from anyone. And second, she wanted the boys and girls who had anything of him to be regular travelers and walkers of passage,—they had no ticket of respectability,—they were in no way to buy their entrance; but for this time, these, they had to come into a Christmas tree that was raging and on the streets when the Christmas tree was ready."
"Poor Mary, how many times she was thinking about this speech, before Christmas day happened! But she didn't think about it throughout St. Victoria's day. Her husband didn't come home for dinner. She didn't expect him. The children came from school at two o'clock, rejoicing in the long morning session and half-day of the afternoon that had been won by her. They had a story of their frown in the snow, and after dinner went quietly away to their little playroom in the attic. And Mary sat down with her baby all afternoon, — nor wanted other company. She could count her breath now, and knew how time on the watch, and she knew it was more stable and slower than the day before. And really he was showing almost an appetite for the clock doll. Her husband was not late. He had taken care of this and had left the shop an hour early."
"He was a king of Hungary who was called Adelbert. When he lived at home, which was not often, it was in a castle of many towers and halls and many stairs, in the city of Buda, on the banks of the river Donau. He had four daughters, and one son, who was to be the king after him, whose name was Ladislaus. But it was the custom of those times, as the boys and girls grew up, to send them for training at a certain distance from their house, even for many months at a time, to try a little experiment on them, and see how they were doing; and so, at the time I say to you, he remained in the castle of Buda Prince Bela, who was the son of the king of Bohemia; and he and the boy Ladislaus studied their lessons together, and stole their kites, and hunted for the otters, and ascended with the falconers together."
"She grew up like other girls in her country. She could not read. None of them could read. But she knew how to weave straw, make fish fillets and catch fish. She could not spell. Indeed, in this country they did not have letters. But she knew how to divide the fish she had caught, how to clean them, how to grill them on coals, how to eat them carefully. She had never studied the ""analysis of her tongue."" But she knew how to use it as a lady; that is, simply, without pretension, and always really. She could sing her little brother to sleep. She could tell stories to her sisters all day long. And she and they were not afraid when evening came, or when they were in trouble, to say a prayer to the good God with a loud voice."
"I don't even know the residence of the city of Mulligan. One night, as he said goodbye to us at Oxford Street, ""I live there,"" he said, pointing to Oxbridge, with the big stick that he is wearing, so his home is in this direction anyway. He has his letters addressed to several of his friends, and his parcels, &c. are left for him in various taverns that he frequents. This pair of tiles, in which you see him dressed, he did me the favor of ordering my own tailor, who is just as anxious as anyone to know the address of the bearer. In the same way my hater asked me, ""Oo was the hirish agent as 'ad ordered four 'ats and a sand boar to be sent to my quarters?' As I didn't know (but I suppose) that the items were never sent, and the Mulligan withdrew his custom of ""four-and-nine penny-threl Infernal"" as he didn't call it."
"The gentleman of the Times (a very difficult man to satisfy) is the loudest and loudest of all, and has made faces more hideous on the refreshment offered to him than any other critic. It is not pointless to get rid of it! When a man has been abused in the Times, he cannot hide it, nor can he hide the knowledge of his having been sentenced to prison by Mr Henry, or publicly pud in Pall Mall. You see it in the eyes of your friends when they meet you. They know it. They have flouted him to a man. They murmur about it at the club, and look at the newspaper on you. My neighbor next door came to me this morning, and I saw from his face that he had the whole story pat."
"This royal pair had only one child, Princess Angelica, who, perhaps, was a paragon in the eyes of courtesans, her parents, and her family. It was said that she had the longest hair, the tallest eyes, the thinest size, the smallest foot, and the most beautiful complexion of any young woman in the Paflagonian dominions. Her achievements were announced to be even greater than her beauty; and the governess shamed their idle students by telling them what Princess Angelica could do. She could play the most difficult pieces of music to see. She could answer any of the ""mangnall's questions."" She knew every date in the history of Paflagonia, and every other country. She knew French, English, Italian, German, Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Cappadocian, Samothracian, Egéen, and Crim Tartar. In a word, she was a very accomplished young creature; and her governess and waiting lady was the strict Comtesse Gruffanuff."
"The men admired him because he was strong and righteous. In all his affairs, they knew that they could depend on him. Everything that came to his examination was carefully weighed in his mind and his decisions were always wise. Women trusted him because he was pure and true, with high thoughts and high ambitions, and the children loved him because of his gentleness and tenderness towards them. He was never so busy with state affairs that he could not stop saying a pleasant word of salvation to the smallest child, and the poorest of his subjects knew that they could count on his interest for them."
"Shortly before Christmas, the discontented tree was the first to fall. As the axe abruptly cut through the stem, and divided the shell, the tree fell with a moaning on the earth, aware of the pain and fainting, and forgot all his dreams of happiness, in the sadness of leaving his house in the forest. He knew that he should no longer see his dear old companions, the trees, or the small bushes and multicolored flowers that had grown by his side; perhaps not even the birds. The journey was not at all pleasant. The tree first recovered by being unsealed in the courtyard of a house, with several other trees; and he heard a man say, ""We want only one, and it is the most beautiful. It is beautiful."" Then came two servants in great delivery, and carried the fir into a large and beautiful apartment."
"Now, it happened a long time ago, in the year — but the exact year does not matter, because you will not find this story written in the history of any of the nations of the world. But in one of the countries of Europe bordering the Mediterranean Sea was a high mountain, which, for the inhabitants of the plains below, seemed to reach the sky itself. Sometimes its top was covered with clouds, so that it could not be seen; other times it stood just and clear, as if it silently asked the people to look up and not down. The lower slopes of the mountain were covered with olive trees, groves of oranges and lemons, and vines, and they were dotted here and there with the small white chambers of the peasants who made their lives of these groves and vines, whose fruit they sold in the city not far away."
"""Oh, Grandma, Grandma!"" cried she; ""you didn't believe that the Christmas angels would think of us, but see, they have done it! Behold, a dear little bird nestled in the toe of your shoe! Oh, isn't it beautiful? Grandma presented herself and looked at what the child was lovingly holding in her hand. There she saw a little bird, whose wing was obviously broken by the rough and noisy winds of the day before, and who had sheltered himself in the safe and dry toe of the old wooden shoe. She gently took the little bird from Gretchen's hands, and cleverly bound her wing broken by her side, so that he didn't need to hurt himself by trying to fly with her."""
"And it seemed to Tom Reynolds that all his Christmas joy had faded behind him. The sun was still shining, the ice was still shining, the skaters were laughing and singing, but Tom was moving slowly, with unlisted and heavy blows. The ""Jolly Ramblers"" were still shining under his feet, but he was not looking at them anymore. What was the use of ""Jolly Ramblers"" when Ralph Evans had a pair of ""Club House"" skates that cost more than a dollar, had a graceful curve, and a flawless clamp, and were guaranteed for a year? It was only four hours when Tom slipped his new skates without worry on his shoulder and began to set up the bank for the house."
"Joe, who was a favourite general because of his beautiful look and gentlemanly manners, and despite his Shabby outfit, was returning home with Annie Raymond, the daughter of the village doctor, when Oscar came. He was himself in secret an admirer of the young woman, but had never received any encouragement from her. He made him angry to see her father's dredging walking on an equal footing with his own favorite, and his rude nature prompted him to insult his enemy.""Miss Raymond,"" he said, raising his hat mockeryly, ""I congratulate you for the beauty you picked up."" Annie Raymond fully appreciated his wickedness, and responded calmly, ""I accept your congratulations, Mr. Norton."" This response made Oscar angry and led him to go further than he would otherwise do."
"The lake was once located in the central part of Pennsylvania State. It was perhaps a mile wide and longer than that and surrounded by mountains and long stretches of hills. At the lower end of the lake was a small colony of importance and at the upper end, where there was no medium-sized stream, was the city of Riverside. At Riverside were located several summer hotels and lodges, and also the elegant hotel in which Ned Talmadge lived, with his parents and four sisters. Joe Bodley was as poor as Ned Talmadge was rich, but the two guys were very friendly. Joe knew a lot about hunting and fishing, and also knew everything about handling boats."
"On farms, utensils and furniture were generally made in the house. Almost everything was made of wood, such as spoons, tanks, hooves, fir trees, closet hinges and closet doors, locks, ploughs and harrows. Each boy learned to use his sniff, and could make brooms from birch trees, bowls, dippers and bottles of gourdes, and pallets of butter from red cherries. Women made soap and candles, carded wool, spun, wove, bleached or dyed linen and wool cloth, and made clothes for the family. They knit mittens and stockings, made straw hats and baskets, and drew feathers of living geese for beds and pillows."
"Lief invited his father, Eric, to become the chief of the expedition, but Eric refused, saying that he was then struck in the years, and adding that he was less able to endure the exhibition of the marine life that he had been. Lief replied that he would, nevertheless, be the one who would be most fit to bring luck, and Eric gave in to Lief's solicitation, and went up from the house when they were ready to sail. They put the ship in order; and, when they were ready, they sailed towards the sea, and first found the land that Bjarni and his ship's companions found the last. They sailed to the land and threw anchor, and they threw a boat and went to the ground, and there was no grass. Great mountains of ice were inside the sea, and he was like a flat [land table of] rock all the way from the sea to the ice mountain; and the country seemed to be completely devoid of good qualities."
"On 13 September, in the evening, Columbus, for the first time, noticed the variation of the needle, a phenomenon that had never been noticed before. He first made no mention of it, lest his people be alarmed; but he soon drew the attention of the pilots and filled them with consternation. It seemed that the very laws of nature changed as they progressed, and they entered another world, subject to unknown influences. They feared that the compass would lose its mysterious virtues, and, without this guide, what would become of them in a vast and inopportune ocean? Columbus charged his science and ingenuity for reasons that appeased their terrors. He told them that the direction of the needle was not to the polar star, but to a fixed and invisible point. The variation was therefore not caused by a falseness in the compass, but by the movement of the northern star, and the revolution itself, which, as the other star, had decircled each other's body, which, as it did, had the revolution itself, which, which, as it did, had, had the same."
"In 1496, a patent was granted to John Cabot and his sons Lewis, Sebastian and Sancius. This patent is interesting as the first surviving document linking England to the New World. He gave the patentees the authority to sail with five ships under the royal sign, and to establish the royal banner on any newly found land, such as the vassals and the king's lieutenants. They were linked to their return to the sail at Bristol and to pay a fifth fee on any net gain. The direction of the voyage, the cargo and the size of the ships, and the mode of treatment with the natives, are all left at the commander's discretion. Details of the voyage itself, so of interest to each Englishman, we have only the weakest knowledge."
"The settlement's location was at the northeast corner of Roanoke Island, from which the settlers could command the strait. There, even now, stifled by the vineyards and undergrowths, and here and there broken by the remains of a bastion on earth, can be traced the contours of the ditch that enclosed the camp, some forty square meters, the house of the first English settlers in the New World... If the failure of his colony was likely to deter Raleigh from continuing his efforts, this was more than offset by the good report of the country given both by Lane and Heriot. Therefore, the following year, Raleigh launched another expedition and a larger expedition under the direction of John White. The constitution of White's expedition seems to show that it was designed to be more a colony, strictly speaking, than the colony of Lane at Roanoke. A government was formed by Raleigh, composed of White and twelve others, incorporated as governor and assistants of the town of Raleigh."
"Each room has a window and a door on the east side, and the south room has two windows on the south with space for my heating, which is one of those with a gate in front so I can see the fire burning. It is almost as good as a fireplace. The logs are unpacked outside because I like the rough finish, but inside the walls are perfectly square and smooth. The cracks in the walls are snobly filled with ""doubing"" and then the walls are covered with heavy grey construction paper, which makes the room very warm, and I really like the appearance. I had two rolls of wallpaper with a bold pink pattern. Being very careful I was able to cut enough roses, which are divided in their choice of color to know if they should be red, yellow, or pink, to make a border about 18 inches from the ceiling."
"As for certain international rules of conduct, the civilized nations of the world have generally agreed for many centuries, in particular with regard to the implementation of treaty obligations, the repression of piracy, the mutual protection of ambassadors, the rights of citizens of a country to the protection of the laws of the country they visit, the protection of women and children in times of war. As in Community law, the rules of international law have often grown as matters of custom. Second, agreements have sometimes been concluded by negotiation and drafting in the form of treaties between the two nations concerned. In the second half of the nineteenth century, several attempts were made to strengthen international law through general conferences of nations. One of the most famous was the Geneva Conference of 1864, which concluded a number of valuable agreements on the care of wounded soldiers and officially recognized the International Red Cross."
"Sitting on its seven hills, San Francisco has long been noticed for its magnificent site, enclosed, as it is, between the Pacific Ocean and its splendid bay, on a peninsula of some five miles wide. Where this juicy in the bay at its most northerly point rises a great promontory known as Telegraph Hill, from which thousands of homeless recently watched the smoke rise from their ruined houses. In the first days of promise of gold, a guard was stationed on this hill to look at the ships entering the Golden Gate from their long journey around the Horn and signal the news welcome to the city below. Hence his name came. Cliffs rose on either side of the Golden Gate, and on one is perched the famous Cliff House, long inn. It stands so low that in the storms the surf floats on its lower porticoes, although its strength is broken by the Rocks of Seal. A main attraction to this house was to see the seals playing on their favorite place, on these rocks."
"History in its broadest aspect is a record of man's migration from one environment to another. America is the last major objective of these migrations. He who understands his history must know his mountains and plains, his climate, his products and his relationship with the sea and other parts of the world. He must know more than that, however, because he must understand how various environments alter the energy and capacity of man and give his character a slope in one direction or another. He must also know the paths by which the inhabitants have reached their present homes, because the influence of the old environments on them may be more important than their immediate environment. In fact, the history of North America may have been more profoundly influenced by the man's legacy of his past homes than by the physical characteristics of his present home. It is indeed of great importance that trade can move freely through natural channels such as New York Harbor, the Mohawk Valley, and the Great Lakes."
"In the 17th century, moreover, France owed much of its national power to a highly centralized and narrowly knit government. Under Richelieu the strength of the monarchy had been strengthened and the power of the nobility broken. When he began his personal reign, Louis XIV continued his work of consolidation and, in the years of his long reign, managed to centralize in the throne all the vestiges of political power. The famous saying attributed to him, ""The State! I am the State!"" did not boast. Nowhere was there a trace of representative government, nowhere was a constitutional control over the royal power. There were councils of various kinds and with various courts, but the men were seated in them at the king's request and were removable at his will. There were also parliaments, but to mention them without explanation, it was only to allow the term to be misled, for they were not representative organs or parliaments in the ordinary sense: their powers were essentially judicial and they were not an obstacle to the regular march of absolutism."
"At the beginning of his life, Washington had had very little formal education. He knew only English. When he became world famous and his friend LaFayette urged him to visit France, he refused because he did not seem able to speak the French language. Like another great soldier, the Duke of Wellington, he always cared about his dress. There was a silent pride in him that threatened nothing derogating his dignity. No one could be more methodical. He kept his accounts rigorously, even by entering into the cost of repairing a hairpin for a pupil. He was a passionate farmer, and it was fun to find him recording in his attentive journal that there were 844,800 seeds of New River Grass to the book Troie and thus determine how many should be sown in the acre. Few young people wrote like Washington, apparently from French sources, and read and reread Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in company and Conversation."
"A fundamental fact is to be observed in the economy of the young nation: people raised much more tobacco and cereals and extracted much more other products than they could use; for the surplus they had to find markets; they also had to rely on the outside world for much of their manufactured goods, especially those of superior quality; in other words, from an economic point of view, the United States remained in the former colonial phase of industrial dependence, which was aggravated rather than mitigated by the separation of Great Britain; during the colonial period, the Americans had carried out a large part of this foreign trade through their own ships; British shipping laws required the transport of goods in British ships, inhabited by British sailors, and specified certain goods which could only be shipped to Great Britain."
"The first house occupied by Washington was at the corner of Pearl and Cherry Streets, then a fashionable locality. What the end of New York's Brooklyn Bridge left of it is now known as Franklin Square. The house was so small that three of its secretaries had to stay in a room; and Custis in his memories tells how one of them, who thought he could write poetry, would sometimes disturb others by walking the ground in his nightshirt trying the rhythm of his lines by repeating them with a strong accent. About a year later, Washington took away in a larger house on the west side of Broadway near Bowling Green. Both buildings went down to an early date before the continuous walk of improvement in New York."
"The usual dimensions of a cabin were sixteen feet by twenty. The wood for the building, having already been cut, was at hand — logs of hickory, oak, young pine, walnut or persimmon. To make the foundations, the men took four of the thickest logs, laid them, notched them, grooved them and hammered them as if they had grown so. The wood had to cling to its only substance to hold the pioneer's home, for there was no iron nail to have in the whole back country. The logs placed on the foundation logs and notched one in the four corners formed the walls; and when they were seven feet away, the builders laid parallel woods and sandstones to make both the floor and ceiling."
"Benjamin Franklin, who was in London in 1760 as agent of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, gave British ministers some wise advice on the conditions of peace that should be made with France. The regions of the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes, he said, had to be kept at all costs by England. Moreover, the Mississippi Valley had to be taken, in order to provide for the growth of the populations of the seafront colonies suitable land within, and therefore to keep them engaged in agriculture. Otherwise, these populations would turn to manufacture, and the industries of the mother country would suffer. The peace treaty, three years later, brought the colony that Franklin suggested. The vast American rear country, with its welcoming rivers and lakes, shaded hills and sunny meadows, became English territory. However, the English people had only the vaguest idea of the extent, appearance and resources of their new possession."
"Land migration attracted the most robust and experienced pioneers, as well as those whose property was in livestock and agricultural equipment rather than in money. The majority came from the most western parts of the then United States, and therefore included men who already had some pioneering experience. Up to Mississippi or even Kansas, these parties usually travelled separately or in small groups from a single locality. Before starting with the Great Plains, however, it became necessary to combine themselves into larger bands for self-help and protection. These recognized meeting points were therefore generally in a state of congestion. Thousands of people with their equipment and animals were engulfed in a certain river bottom while waiting for the propitious moment to get on the road."
"The underground railway occupied an insignificant place in the general plan of emancipation, even in the minds of the directors. It was a lesser task preparatory to the great work. As for the number of slaves who obtained their freedom through it, there is a wide range of opinions. Statements to Congress by the members of the South that one hundred thousand had escaped must be considered as gross exaggerations. In any case the loss was limited mainly to the border states. Moreover, it was stated with some proof that the danger of servile insurrection was diminished by the escape of potential leaders. From the point of view of the great corps of anti-slavery men who expected to settle the issue of slavery by peaceful means, it was a major calamity that, just at a time when the conditions were most favourable for the transfer of the active crusade from the general government to the separate States, public attention should be directed to the point where the conflict was most acute and irrepressible."
"President Grant, now in harmony with the Executive, responded by placing the reconstruction of the three states in the hands of the President, but with the condition that each state should ratify the fifteenth amendment. Grant then set a deadline for voting in each state and ordered that in Virginia and Mississippi the waiver clauses be presented separately. As a result, the constitutions were ratified but the proscription was rejected. Radicals obtained control of Mississippi and Texas, but a conservative combination led Virginia and thus nearly kept the state outside the Union. Finally, in the first months of 1870, the three states were re-admitted. As far as Georgia was concerned, a special situation existed. In June 1868, Georgia was re-admitted with the first of the reconstructed states."
"The characteristics of the pioneer have therefore been the characteristic features of the American in action. The memories of successive generations have tended to emphasize these qualities to the neglect of others. All those who have benefited from the free life of the woods will confess that his own judgment on his occasional summer associates turns, quite naturally and almost exclusively, on their characteristics as loggers. From the forest, these gentlemen can be more or less admirable divine, pedantic, businessmen; but the verdict of their companions in the forest is based mainly on the only question of their ability to adapt to the environment of the camp. Are they fast eye and foot, skillful with cane and cannon, joyful on rainy days, ready to do a little more than their share of the dragery? If so, the memory holds them. Certain unconscious selections such as this was at work in the classification of our representative men. The construction of the nation and the literary expression of its purpose and ideals are tasks that have called for the strength of a great variety of individuals."
"Similarly, the present generation of Americans inherited a country that was made of wood and turned it into steel. What distinguishes today's physical America from that of forty years ago is the extensive use of this metal. Our fathers used very little steel in rail transport; rails and locomotives were generally made of iron, and wood was the dominant material for railway bridges. Steel cars, both for passengers and freight, now take the place everywhere of the most fragile substance. Today we travel in steel metros, transform our company into steel buildings, and live in private apartments and houses that are largely made of steel. The steel automobile has long replaced the wooden transport; the steel ship has moved iron and wood."
"Whether or not the American farmer realized that the 19th century had undergone a total change in the world's economic relations, he clearly understood that something was wrong in his own case. The first and most impressive proof of this was in the prices he received for what he was to sell. From 1883 to 1889 inclusive, the average price of wheat was seventy-three cents a bushel, thirty-six cents a corn, twenty-eight cents an oats. In 1890, crops were poor in most grain regions, while prosperous periods continued to keep the public consuming manufacturing areas in a position to buy; therefore, corn and oats almost doubled in prices, and wheat grew by 20 percent."
"In June 1841, the first United Parliament of Canada met in Kingston, where the most central point had been chosen as the new capital. Under the energetic leadership of Sydenham, a program of reforms was put in place. An important loan, guaranteed by the British government, allowed the construction of roads, bridges and canals around the rapids of the St. Lawrence. Municipal institutions were put in place and reforms were undertaken in the provincial administration. Lord John Russell in England and Sydenham in Canada looked forward to keeping the question of responsible government in the background. During the first few months, they succeeded, but the new Parliament contained men as strong as either and from any other point of view. Prior to the first session, Baldwin and the new French Canadian leader, La Fontaine, had raised the issue and began a new struggle in which their unique dedication and unwavering courage had to achieve complete success."
"By gaining its independence, the United States gave a practical example of what could be done elsewhere in America. Translated into French, the Declaration of Independence was read and commented on by passionates who dreamed of the possibility of applying its principles on their own lands. Even more powerful were the ideas liberated by the French Revolution and Napoleon. Born across the ocean, the doctrines of ""Liberty, Fraternity, Equality"" aroused the ardour of thought of action, although the Spanish and Portuguese Americans who plotted and plotted were the most noble handful. The seed they planted was slow to germinate among the peoples who had learned to consider foreign and heretical things."
"Nicolas and Natacha, his son and his daughter, often found their father and mother in an anxious consultation, speaking below the shades of the sale of their Moscow house or their property in the neighborhood. Having thus retired in private life, the count gave no more parties or entertainment. Life in Otradnoë was much less gay than in previous years; still, the house and estate were as full of servants as ever, and twenty or more people sitting at dinner every day. These were dependents, friends and intimates, who were considered almost part of the family, or at least seemed unable to tear themselves from it: among them a musician named Dimmler and his wife, Ioghel the dancer-master and his family, and former Miss Below, former governess of Natacha and Sonia, the niece of the Earl and adopted child, and now the guardian of Petia, his younger son; besides others who found it easier to live at the cost of the Count than at their own."
"""We had a lot of happy time together,"" he said, then stopped. Currently, he said, ""The ropes must be cut, because they are worthless."" And he took a knife and cut. ""Oh!"" shouted the E rope, in a short and painful tone. The boy cut. ""Oh! the next, but the boy cut. ""Oh!"" said the third, sadly; and he stopped at the fourth. A sharp pain caught him, that fourth rope, to which he never dared to give a name, he did not cut. Now, a feeling came upon him that it was not the fault of the ropes that he was not able to play, and just then saw his mother walking slowly on the slope to the place where he was lying, so that she could bring him home. A greater fear than he ever overcame him; he held the violin by the ropes cut off, rushed to her feet, and shouted, ""No, mother! I will not return to the house until I saw it."""
"When Sylvestre Ker was alone, he listened to the noise of the waves that fell on the beach and sighed the wind among the great oaks, two sad sounds. And he looked with contradictory sentiments at the empty seats of Matheline and his dear mother Josserande. Little by little, he had seen the widow's black hair become grey, then white, around her bloody temples. That night, the memory carried her to her cradle, on which had folded the sweet and noble face of her who had always spoken to her about God. But from where did these rings of gold come, which mingled with the black hair of Josserande, and which shone in the light of the sun above the snowy locks of her mother? And this laughter, oh, this silvery laughter of youth, which prevented Sylvestre Ker from hearing, in his pious memories, the calm and grave voice of his mother. Where did he come from?"
"And behold, the place was light, and a great staircase of light, like cloths of gold, stretched out into heaven, and there were angels that went in number, and came and went, with locks like nests of bees, and pink robes, and green, and blue from the sky, and white, embroidered thickly with purer pearls, and wings like butterflies and peacock tails, with brilliance of solid gold around their heads. And they went and came, carrying garlands and scattered flowers, so that, although in the middle of winter, it was like a garden in June, so sweet of roses and lilies, and of Gilly flowers. And the angels sang; and when they had finished their work, they said, ""It is good,"" and went away, holding their hands and flying in the sky over the fir trees. Hilarion was greatly stunned, and said five Paters and six Aves; and the next day he put an old tree in the midst of his hands."
"""Come, Hermas, come down! The night has passed. It is time to be agitated. Christ was born today. Peace is with you in His name. Make it quick and come down!"" A small group of young men stood in a street of Antioch, at the dusk of the morning, fifteen hundred years ago. It was a class of candidates who had almost finished their two years of training for the Christian church. They had come to call their comrade Hermas from his dwelling. Their voices joyfully sounded through the fresh air. They were full of this joyful feeling of life that the young people felt when they woke up and came to awaken the one who was still sleeping. There was a note of friendly triumph in their call, as if they were unconsciously exulting by having begun the adventure of the new day before their comrade. But Hermas was not asleep. He was waking up for hours, and the dark walls of his narrow dwelling had been a prison for his troubled heart."
"The light that wrestled through the frozen windows of the charcuterie store, and the saloon at the corner, fell upon the men with empty dinner loaves that pressed towards the house, their coats shook closely, and the heads ran against the constant explosion of the river, as if they were trying to go down the street. The wind had forced the door of the ajar saloon, and he whistled through the crack; but there it seemed that no one was afraid. Between the roarings of laughs, the flashing of glasses and the dice rattle on the hardwood counter were heard in the street. More than one of the passersby who came to the door was caught with an extra thrill in which the vision of the woman and the little ones waiting at home for her arrival was eaten up, while he fell to brag."
"His hope was not disappointed: for the bottom was found most abundantly filled; and Willie looked forward to examining its contents. He was glad that he had borrowed the bottom of his grandfather for the occasion; for his own little sock could never have contained the beautiful, great snoring, and the pretty ark of Noah, who now met his eyes. And then the great, soft ball, just to play in the house in stormy times; and the beautiful transparent slate, with which Willie could have fun when the older people wanted him to be quiet. All these things, and much more, were packed safely in the great grandfather's bottom."
"It may be a useful lesson for you, dear Isabel, she says. She will teach you that no true happiness is ever derived from a selfish act. Your motive by presenting a gift more dear to your teacher than the rest of your companions were willing to do it was selfish. You had to receive praise and admiration. In this you were disappointed, and therefore you are unhappy. Another time, I hope you will do better. By spending your money on Christmas gifts, you will remember those who need it most, and you will gladly give it, hoping for nothing again. Isabel still cried, but less violent than before, and when Mary entered with a radiant face, and told her mother of the gratitude and joy of the poor they had visited, Isabel put her arm around her neck and asked her forgiveness for her bad mood, and promised that when another Christmas would come, she would also remember those who needed it most."
"Before I speak to my young readers about Mr. Gray's return with little Ellen, I have to present them more particularly to Clara; although, from what I have already said about her, they may have formed a good idea of her character, and rightly concluded that she is very similar to herself, sometimes trying to do what is right, and suffering from being led by the good spirits around her, and at other times a little selfish and insensitive, allowing the bad spirits to lead her in the wrong way. Clara was almost eleven years old. She was generally obedient to her parents and teachers, kind to her playmates, diligent in her studies, ordered and industrialized in her habits."
"""O Father! Please come to the door, and see how beautiful everything is,"" exclaimed William Mason, running ardently in the room where his father was sitting. Mr. Mason was always happy to give his son pleasure, and he put aside the newspaper he was reading, and followed him to the door. There had been a strong snowstorm a few days before, which was succeeded by the rain, and then by the severe cold. Everything was now completely set in the ice. ""Is it not beautiful, Father?"" said William. ""I was all around the courtyard and the garden, and everything put on his winter coat. Every little branch and twig, every grass blade, and even the small stones are covered with ice."" ""That's what we called a silver morning, when I was little, said Mr. Mason."
"He opened his eyes again. The room was darkening. He almost forgot his pain for a few moments, seeing how the sunlight had straightened up to a narrow alley that approached the south end of the window to the ground in front of his mother's chair. He looked at the last rays as they slowly left the ground and stole his dress on his knees and chest, leaving everything behind and down in the shadow. Now, they had reached his face. He was leaning on his work. Well, he knew it was a Christmas gift, perhaps for him, a Christmas gift, and tomorrow it was Christmas! He looked again to see if he could find out what she was doing, but the light had left him now, and had risen up on the image."
"The wind whistled through the old lindens and maple trees in front of my windows, the snow was sweeping the street, and the sky was black as a December sky may have been here in Christiania. I was just as dark in the mood. It was Christmas Eve, the first time I was away from the Cosey fire of my house. I had recently received my officer's commission, and I had hoped that I would have rejoiced my older parents from my presence during the holidays, and I had also hoped to be able to show myself in all my glory and splendour to the ladies of our parish. But a fever had brought me to the hospital, which I had only left a week before, and now I was in a very exhausting state of convalescence. I had written at home for a horse and a sledge and my father's fur coat, but my letter could hardly arrive at our valley before Christmas, and the horse could not be in town before the Christmas Eve."
"In the theatre of Shoreditch, on Christmas Eve, 1598, the servants of Lord Chamberlain presented a new comedy. Never did the Burbages play in such a house. She applauded all the speeches – good, bad, or indifferent. Certainly, some of the playwright – Prince Hal and Falstaff, Bardolph and Mistress Quickly – were old friends; but this alone is not for such a welcome. A cutpurse in the two-penny gallery that had been paid to lead the applause in the wake of this one, gave plows in the wake of it, and leaned on a perplexed smile."" Bravo, master!"" he said to his left neighbour a peasant burly, red-faced well beyond the middle age, whose laugh kept the rocking bench."
"First of all, you will let me say that a bad temperament is a affliction, which owns it, and shortens life. I don't know what you think: but my grandfather was constable in these parts for forty-seven years, and you will find on his tombstone in the cemetery of Manaccan that he never had a word of cross for the man, the woman, or the child. He didn't take credit for it: he ran into the family, and to this day we are all terribly gentle to deal with. Well, if ever a man was born bad in his temperament, was Captain Bligh, who came from the parish of Saint-Tudy, and made himself known to everyone on this sad affair aboard the Bounty."
"Once upon a time, many years ago, there was a traveller, and he went on a journey. It was a magical journey, and it must have seemed very long when it began, and very short when it arrived halfway. He travelled on a rather dark path for a little while, without meeting anything, until he finally came to a beautiful child. So he said to the child, ""What are you doing here?"" And the child said, ""I am always playing. Come play with me!"" So, he played with this child all day, and they were very happy. The sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the water was so sparkling, the leaves were so green, the flowers were so beautiful, and they heard such singing birds and saw so many butterflies, that everything was beautiful."
"In the mid-summer holidays, some of our companions who lived within walking distance, came back and climbed the trees outside the wall of the playground, to look at the old Cheeseman who was reading on his own. He was always as sweet as tea — and it's quite sweet, I hope! — so when they whistled to him, he looked and noded his head; and when they said, ""Halloa, old Cheeseman, what did you eat?"", he said, ""Mutton boiled;"" and when they said, ""Isn't that lonely, old Cheeseman?"" he said, ""It's a little boring sometimes:"" and then they said, ""Goodbye, old Cheeseman!"" and climbed again."
"Well, on a rainy Sunday evening, in 1855, just twelve days before Christmas, in the small town of Oregoes, in Worcester County, Messe., Aunt Kindly and Uncle Nathan were sitting in their comfortable living room before a light wood fire. It was about eight hours, a stormy night; now it was snowing a bit, then it was raining, then snowing again, as if the weather were determined on a kind of storm, but had not yet taken his mind for snow, rain, or hail. Now the wind was roaring in the fireplace, and began out of his sleep a large turtle-shell cat, who was lying on the carpet that Aunt Kindly had made for her. Tabby opened her yellow eyes suddenly, and erected her smells, but finding that it was only the wind and not a mouse that made the noise, she stretched out a large leg and gagged, and then hugging her head down to show her white throat, and went to sleep again."
"The advantage was that he often had the opportunity to guide strangers visiting the city for the first time, or as a porter, to carry their value or other baggage. Being a bright, wide-awaited boy, with a face and a pleasant way, he found his services considerably in demand; and counting his money at the end of the week, he found much to his encouragement, which he had received on average about a dollar and twenty-five cents a day. ""It's better than selling his papers alone,"" he thought. ""Moreover, Tim is not likely to meet me here. I wonder that I didn't think about settling in before!"" At night, he spent an hour, and sometimes more, continuing his studies, under the direction of Florence."
"To his surprise, the young man found that he was not called to join his comrades in calamity, but that he was left in loneliness. While turning in the spirit of what it could mean, he observed in one corner the two rolls of black bread which he had received the previous night, and which, being not hungry at the time, he had neglected. As a healthy appetite was at that time obstructing his attention, he took one and began to eat. It was not attractive, but, being not particular, he consumed it. He even took the other and ate that, too, after which he sighed and desired more! As there was no longer to be had, he went to the fountain in the courtyard and washed his breakfast with water."
"When I met Dumps, he harassed me along a sequestered country alley. It was in the days of the dogs. The dust was thick on the road; the creature's legs were remarkably short but active, and his hair was long, he carried the dust into the clouds while he was running. He was dazzling, and I observed that one or two stones seemed to run with, or after, him. The voice of an angry man also seemed to chase him, but the owner of the voice was at this moment hidden by a bend in the alley, which was bordered by high stone walls. Hydrophobia, of course, blew me into the mind. I grabbed my stick and approached the wall."
"It would soon be Christmas and Harry Kenton, at his office of the Pendleton Academy, saw the snow falling heavily outside. The school stood on the skirt of the city, and the forest descended to the edge of the playground. The big trees, oak and ash and elm, were dressed in white, and they stood in a vast and glittering trace against the dark sky. The office was of the old kind, intended for two, and Harry's comrade was his cousin, Dick Mason, of his own years and his size. They were going to obtain their diploma in June, and both were big and powerful for their age. There was a strong family resemblance and yet a difference. Harry's face was the most sensitive and sometimes blood leaped as quick silver in his veins."
"The morning was clear and cold, the slippery streets, but lively with life, mainly military. He wore his knapsack full of food, and his blankets in a pack on his back, that his passport turned out to be his right as a peasant trading horses, and returning from the front to his house for a new supply. But there was little danger for him at the moment, because there were many other peasants and peasants in Metz on one race or another. He was walking around the hotel, and currently noticed signs of agitation. Several cars, one of many magnificence, led to the entrance and stopped there, obviously waiting for a company of importance. John had no doubt as soon as it was the equipment of the Prince of Auersperg. No one else was travelling in such a state, and he would stay to see him go with his prisoners."
"Lennox, Willet, and Tayoga fell asleep, one by one, and the Onondaga was the last to close their eyes. The three, wrapped in their blankets, fell asleep in total darkness on the stone plateau, with the canoe next to them. They were no more than a pinpoint in the vast desert that stretched thousands of kilometres unknown from Hudson to the Pacific, apparently as lost in the world as the dormants in a cave earlier, when all the earth was dark with the forest and desert. Although the storm could not reach them heavily for long hours while they were sleeping. The sweeping of the rain maintained a sound of continuous driving."
"Then he made a very comfortable cushion of fallen leaves to sit down, and he remained there for a long time, his rifle on his knees. His eyes were wide open, but no part of his body was restless. He had acquired the gift of infinite patience, and with him the physical art difficult to remain absolutely motionless for a long time. So complete was his mastery on himself that the little wild game began to believe by and by that he was not alive. Birds sang freely on his head and the hare hopped through the undergrowth. Yet, the hunter saw everything and his silence allowed him to listen even more acutely. The sun that had risen tall and bright, thus remained, flooding the world with golden lights and making it wonderfully seductive to Willet, whose eyes never washed from the shades and varied aspects of the forest. They were all peaceful now, but he had no illusions. He knew that hostile force would send many hunters."
"Harry did not wake up until late the next morning. Jackson, for once, allowed his soldiers a long rest, and they were entitled to it. When he got up from his blankets, he found burning fires, and the pleasant smell of coffee, bacon and other food came to his nostrils. Many wounded were lying on blankets, but, as usual, they were stoic, and did not complain. The army, in truth, was joyous, even more exulting. Everyone had the feeling that he had shared great triumphs, unprecedented exploits, but they gave the chief credit to their leader, and they spoke admirably and affectionately of Old Jack. All the day had been in luxury for a long time unknown to them. They had an abundance of food, most captured, and their rations were not limited."
"A light canoe of bark, containing a single human figure, moved quickly upwards of one of the twin streams that formed Ohio. The clear and deep water, coming through the rocky ground, slowly fell to the edges, where it threw the earth, but in the center the whole current flowed regularly and without noise. The thin shadows of the early twilight fell, throwing a pale tint on the world, a tint touched here and there with the living fire of the sun, which had gone, while leaving burning embers behind. A flaming tree, piercing straight through the heavy forest that was clothed on each bank, fell directly on the figure in the boat, like a hidden light illuminates a great image, while the rest is left in the shade. It was not a common forest runner who was sitting in the middle of the red beam. Yet, a boy, just years, he jumped the great paddle with ease and vigour that the strongest man of the West might have envied."
"Robert stopped for a few moments in the room. Voice sounds came from the dining room, showing that the supper was still in progress. He thought of going back there to listen to the speech, but he thought that the time of the youth at the table had passed. They were in their secrets now, and he walked to the large room that contained the chest of the drawers. A dark light of an unbroken window shone in the apartment and he was in his mind waiting there for Tayoga, but he suddenly stopped at the door and looked in astonishment. A shadow was moving in the room, thin, impalpable and noiseless, but she had all the appearance of a man. Moreover, she had a size and shape that were familiar to her, and she reminded him of the spy, Garay. He was too surprised to move, and therefore he simply looked."
"But the night was not favorable to their plans. The sky was the usual cloudless blue of the Mexican plateau, the moon was full and all the stars were outside. What they wanted was bad weather, hoping that the execution of the prisoners would not be started until the Mexicans had reached a higher authority in Urrea, perhaps Santa Anna himself. They made their own camp two miles from Urrea, and Obed and the Panther divided the watch. Urrea started early the next morning, and the three chases. The dawn was grey, and the breeze was cooled. As they were climbing on, the wind rose and its edge became so sharp that there was another Norther. The Panther rolled out of her bag the most beautiful serum that Ned had ever seen. It was of the best material, colored a deep scarlet and it had a golden fringe."
"Texas was then a vague and unknown name in the minds of many. It could extend to the Rio Grande or extend only to the Nuecs, but to most of the Rio Grandes was the border between them and Mexico. Thus it felt Ned and all his comrades. They were now on the ground that could possess the overlordship of Mexico, but for which they, the Texans, spent their blood. It was strange what attachment they had for her, although none of them had been born there. Beyond, in the outside world, there were many disputes over the law or evil of their business, but they knew that they had to fight for their lives, and for the houses they had built in the desert on the faith of promises that had been broken."
"It was now summer, but, having been a season of abundant rains, the grass and foliage were the brightest and most intense green. They entered one of the richest portions of Kentucky, and the intact soil was lush with fertility. As a pioneer himself said: ""All that they had to do was tickle with a hoe, and he laughed in a harvest."" There was proof of his strength in the grass and trees. Never before had the travelers seen oaks and bees of such circumference or elms and hickories of such height. The grass was tall and thick and the canebrake was so dense that the passage through it seemed impossible."
"When last spring we arrived and went back to Lamington for our Easter holiday, a large amount of money had been collected, almost $15.00, if I remember correctly; in any case a lot to buy the materials for a tent of good size and leave a large surplus for supplies, etc. Bill understood on the paper how much we would need canvas for a tent of 7 feet wide by 9-1/2 feet long, what he estimated would be big enough to hold us. It took 34 meters, 30 inches wide. Then we visited the village store to make our purchase. Canvas we found a little too expensive for us, but a material called drill seemed about right."
"Even if the junction, when they struck it at the Forks, was not so smooth and well built as the river highway, Tom did not reduce the speed. Mile after mile rolled behind them. From the low ridge, they took a glimpse of the cup where the two trains had gathered. It was the old story of a cargo being dilatory when leaving a block that had been opened for the passage of an express. The express had run his nose into the caboose of cargo, and more harm was done to the freight than to the passenger cars. A large crowd, however, had gathered. Tom ran the car in an open ground next to the tracks, where part of the railway fence had been ripped off. Two passenger cars were on their sides, and one or two of the box cars had broken out."
"Ruth was excited. In the first place, as for most girls of her age, a ""real live actress"" was as much a wonder as a Grand Auc would have been; only, of course, Hazel Gray was much more charming than the garfowl! Ruth Fielding was interested in moving pictures — and for a particular reason. Long before she won the reward for the return of the pearl necklace to Nettie Parsons' aunt, Ruth had thought of writing a script. It was not a very original thought, for many, many other people thought the same thing. Sometimes, when she had been to a movie show, Ruth had wondered why she could not write a play as good as many she saw, and get money for her. But it was only a thought; she knew nothing about the technique of the script, or how to get an opinion on her work if she had to write one."
"She went out and looked on both sides. It was then that she saw how threatening the appearance of the clouds on the other side of the river was. The view was moving away from her thoughts for the moment from the strange noise she had heard. She did not bother to look under the summer house on the edge of the water. Instead, another noise rang her ears. This time, that she could only be mistaken for what it was — the musical horn of Tom Cameron's automobile. Ruth turned quickly to look at the road. A black car, marooned, long and low as a runner, came along the road, leaving behind her a funnel of dust. There were two people in the car. The girl next to the driver, with black hair and the young, beat her handkerchief by saluting when she saw Ruth standing near the summer house."
"Jennie Stone was a popular girl and had gallorized friends. Many of these girlfriends had come from afar to see their beloved ""Heavy Stone"" (as she had been nicknamed in the former Briarwood Hall days) married to the man she had met in France while she was engaged in these useful and helpful occupations in which so many American girls entered during the war. Moreover, Jennie was the first of the former Briarwood Hall ready to get married, and this was to be a gala occasion. It was not a ""weepy"" wedding, but a moment of joy. And the wedding party that descended the alley made an image as brilliant as ever seen in the old church. The bridesmaids of honor in pink was so refreshing to look like a bouquet of arbutus."
"""Come in,"" invited the father and the boys, standing in a group that looked at the button of the door turning slowly. As it opened silently, they saw an old woman standing on the threshold, all bent, a long black cape and a cape covering her from head to toe. She wore a rod with a crook and leaned very heavily on her while walking. She began to bite the room and sit down by fire. Her coarse grey and grey hair fell into suffocating locks on her face almost hiding her sight. Suddenly, the lights extinguished, leaving the room in darkness, except for the light of the fire. ""Place the pot in front of me,"" she ordered, with a loud and broken voice, shaking her stick to Fat. ""Yes, Ma'am,"" said Fat, pressed to obey."
"A fortnight ago, the snow was everywhere, the skaters were still on the creeks, the young people who had matches of rough snowballs, then suddenly one morning the white cover turned a pale gray, unhealthy, sweet, and wilted. The pallid sky was blue, the brown earth was shown in plates, there were joyful sounds of long-house animals, the rivulets were all flowing in the rush to inflate the streams, and from there to the river and the lakes. The small rings of fir and juniper were thinning, the branches of pines swollen large fur buds, bursting in pale green cups that moved from each wind. The hemlocks drew feathery frowns, the spikes of blue green spruce, the maples turned around red flowers and then tiny leaves not bent."
"Leila and Eugene Clark were very impressed with the new house; however, with the others, were quite ready to stop their game so that they could do justice to the big cake with its nine candles, and its crown of flowers; while the amount of ice cream eaten clearly showed that the refreshments were quite to the taste of the guests. Leila brought Dimple a box of candy, and Eugene presented him with a bunch of beautiful roses. Rock, too, although he could not spare time to rush home and get her gift for her, had something to give; an exquisite small fan with carved ivory sticks, which he said was made in China, and that his mother had bought in California. Mrs Hardy added to the gift a lean pink sash, and Florence had struggled secretly to make Rubina a new froc and had very well succeeded."
"The sun lay behind the hills, and touched the tops of the trees along their base; the farther the mountains were very dark against a yellow line of the sky. Marian continued his pensive path towards the garden, turned to the door and mounted a ladder that leaned on the side of the old brick wall. From the ladder one could reach a long member of a clawed apple tree on which the apples were almost ripe. Marian climbed the ladder very carefully, taking care not to catch his pants on a nail or a wig by projecting along the stupefying limb to settle in a crotch of the tree. From this place she could see the distant sea, pink purple, and brilliant silver. Marian did not look at this, however, but turned her face towards the mountains."
"Jenik was not a very intelligent man, and at the end of a very short period of time he began to carry his wife. She asked how he managed to build palaces and obtain so much precious things. He told her everything about the watch, and she never rested until she had stolen the precious talisman. One evening she took the watch, rubbed it, and wanted a car driven by four horses; and in that car she left immediately for her father's palace. There she called her servants, told them to follow her in the car, and drove straight to the seaside. Then she rubbed her watch, and desired that the sea be crossed by a bridge, and that a magnificent palace rise in the middle of the sea."
"The magic spell was in Latin, of course; but the princess knew Latin very well, and soon she had the magic song by heart. Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf. Then she threw the window and removed the curtains and extinguished all the lights, except two scented candles that burned with a white light under a round mirror with a silver frame in front of the window. And in this mirror the moon shone white and full, filling all the space of it, so that the room was impregnated with a strange silver light. Now the whole room seemed to swing gently, shaking and trembling; and as it trembled, it sounded and sounded with low silver music, as if it were filled with waves of the sea. Then the princess took a large pool of silver, covered with strange black signs and figures raised in silver."
"The king had already been married once and had by his first wife seven children, six boys and a daughter, whom he loved more than anything in the world. And now, because he feared that their mother-in-law would not treat them well and harm them, he put them in a solitary castle that stood in the midst of a wood. He was so hidden, and the way up to that was so difficult to find, that he himself did not have a wise woman who had given him a reel of yarn that possessed a wonderful property: when he threw it before himself and showed him the way. But the king went so often to his dear children that the queen was offended at his absence. She became curious and wanted to know what he should do alone in the wood."
"Like his father, he began to think of work and trampled half of Brittany in search of him. No one seemed to want it, and he wandered from one place to another, until he found himself in a dense wood, without paths, and not much light. Here, he spent two whole days, without eating anything and very little water to drink, going first in one direction and then in another, but never being able to find his way out. During the first night, he slept healthy and was too tired to fear neither man nor beast, but when the darkness came for the second time, and the grunts were heard in the distance, he became afraid and sought a tree raised out of reach of his enemies."
"When Elsa woke up the next morning in her silk bed, with her soft white pillows, she saw a beautiful dress lying on the back of a chair, ready to put it on. A maid came in to comb her long hair, and brought the most beautiful linen for her use; but nothing gave Elsa as much joy as the little pair of embroidered shoes she held in her hand, for the girl had so far been forced to run barefoot by her cruel mother-in-law. In her enthusiasm, she never thought of the rough clothes she had worn the day before, which had disappeared as if by magic during the night. Who could have taken them? Well, she had to know that by-and-by. But one can guess that the doll had been dressed in them, which was to return to the village in her place."
"Then the shepherd went out to the house, and, on his way through the wood, he heard and understood all that was said by the birds, and by every living creature. When he returned to his sheep, he found the grazing flock calmly, and as he was very tired, he lay down by them to rest a little. Hardly had he done so when two ravens flew and perched on a tree nearby, and began to speak to one another in their own tongue: ""If this shepherd knew only that there was a vault full of gold and silver under which the lamb was lying, what would he not do?"" When the shepherd heard these words, he went straight to his master and said to him, and the master immediately took a cart and broke the door of the vault, and they took the treasure."
"In the place where the prince intended to hunt, he saw a very beautiful deer. He commanded that he should not be killed, but that he should be trapped or captured by a knot. The deer sought a place where he could escape from the ring of the drummers, and spyed on a man unattended by the prince himself. He bound himself up and leaped straight on his head, and went out of the ring, and tore like the wind of the east into the wilderness. The prince put spurs on his horse and pursued him; and was soon lost at the sight of his disciples. Until the sun of light of the world stood above his head in the zenith, he did not lift up the eyes of the deer; suddenly he disappeared behind some rising ground, and with all his search he could find no more trace of him. He was now soaked with sweat, and he breathed of pain; and the tongue of his horse ran out of his mouth."
"The king asked him what he was reading, and he said that he was reading on Paradise, and was praying for him to be worthy to enter there. Then they began to speak, and, goodbye, the king asked the false man whether he could show him a glimpse of Paradise, for he found it very difficult to believe in what he could not see. The false man answered him that he was asking for something very difficult, and perhaps very dangerous; but that he would pray for him, and perhaps he could do so; only he warned the king of the dangers of his unbelief and of the curiosity that prompted him to ask for it. However, the king should not turn away from his purpose, and he promised the false man to always provide him with food, if he, in return, prayed for him."
"There was no moon, and it was Halloween night, and everyone was burning nuts and grabbing apples in a bathtub of water with their hands tied, and playing all sorts of other games, until the Lad Majore got tired of waiting for them to lie down. The Black Bird, who was more accustomed to the business, lay on the hay and fell asleep, telling the boy to wake him up when the joyful artisans left. But the Lad Majore, who could no longer stand, bowed down to the cow and loosened the heads of the cattle that was attached, and they began to kick and blow, and made such a noise that the company in the farm ran to them again."
"The first day of a new term still seems intolerablely long, and with an event as interesting as a ballot in front of them most of the girls felt the hour and a half to slide, and turned many superreptitious gazes towards wristwatches. Merle in particular, who hated the French translation, moaned as she looked at the words in the dictionary, and made several stupid mistakes, because her thoughts were centered on the election instead of on the question in hand. Once she dipped openly, and drew a reprobation from Mademoiselle, where she carried a submissive sigh, controlled her boredom, and would lamentably transfer Fénelon's blooming feelings into the English language."
"The capacity of the apartment was designed to accommodate a flock of sheep or a farm wagon and horses, so that there was room and to spare even for thirty-seven girls and their hand luggage. Evan Davis, the old crunchy ferryman, welcomed them with his usual unarticulated grunt, a kind of ""Oh, you are here again!"" welcome form that was stronger than graceful. He tied the protective chains carefully to the end of the boat, called a Welsh remark to his son, Griffith, and, grabbing the handle, began to work the ventlass. Very slowly and quietly the apartment threw into the river. The tide was full and the wide expanse of water seemed like a lake. The clan chains brought clusters of algae and river grass that fell with a mud on the bridge."
"When the little colonel arrived at the hotel, the omnibus left the door to get to the station, a few blocks away. Thinking that Betty and Eugenia were perhaps on the train to come, she went to the living room to wait for the omnibus to return. She had bought a box of chocolate creams at the corner cake shop to divide with Hero. Fidelia had walked around the living room in her absence, and now sitting at the old piano was banging on her yellow keys with all her power. She played exceptionally well for a girl of her age, but Lloyd had the impression that a public salon was not a place to show her achievements, and her nose climbed up with contempt when she entered."
"After a week of picnics and fishing parties, lawn parties and tennis tournaments, there had been no special entertainment. It was a warm morning, and the girls were out under the trees: Betty in the swing, with a book on her knees, as usual, Joyce on a camp stool near here, making a sketch of her, and Eugenia was gently swinging in a hammock. The little colonel had tossed with her, but something had called her home, and a deep silence fell on the little group after her departure. Betty, lost in her book, and Joyce, intent on her sketch, did not seem to notice, but currently Eugenia had sat in the hammock and had given her an impatient taping."
"Mrs. Chartley had welcomed several types of girls to her school and was familiar with every nuance of embarrassment, but she had never been greeted with such an explosion. Unhoped to make herself understood, Mary began in the middle of her carefully planned speech and explained without breath at the back, on the reason why she had arrived at this inopportune moment. The explanation was so characteristic of her, so heart-feeling and quite honest, that she revealed much more that she wanted and opened a wide door in the sympathies of Madame. As she stood up looking at the girl with serious friendly eyes, Mary suddenly became aware of something strangely comforting. She was not a great character, but a lovely being who could understand. The discovery facilitated the second part of her explanation."
"There was nothing left to keep Dick in Cedarville, and he prepared to return to Stanhope cottage with the mare. But before entering the main drug store, and here he bought a box of chocolates of choice for Dora, because fortunately he had his money to spend with him, or at least the balance that remained of the football party. When Dick arrived at the cottage, he found both the wash and the carpenter at work, one in the laundry and the other by finishing the new barn. The money taken from the bank had been given to Mr. Gradley, so that Mrs. Stanhope had no longer that to worry him. Feeling that he could do little at school for the balance of that day, Dick decided to hunt through the woods for a trace of Josiah Crabtree, and soon after giving Dora the chocolates, on which the daughter was very happy."
"The first stop was to be in Cleveland, and from that city, they had to go to Sandusky, then go up the lake and cross the Detroit River to Detroit. Here, a short stay had to be made, then the trip had to be resumed through Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River to Lake Huron. Once on Lake Huron, they expected to go along the east coast of Michigan, stopping when they wished, and thus gradually going to Whitefish Bay and Lake Superior. What they would do when Lake Superior was reached would depend on how long they had left for the exit. The Swallow was a solid and well-built boat, fifty feet long and a corresponding beam width. It had been built for a pleasure boat and had all the latest improvements. It belonged to a rich man from Buffalo, who had known the Rovers for years. The rich man was now travelling to Europe, and had been too happy to hire the yacht for six weeks."
"The idea of a trip on Bob's yacht was suitable for everyone, and it was decided that the whole party should go out early Monday morning, taking the old Jerry Tolman with them. They had to load well with provisions and visit not only several points along the coast, but also one or two of the islands located twenty-five to thirty miles south of Santa Barbara. The boys Rover had already inspected the old Glory and found it as a first-class yacht in all respects. The boat was about sixty feet long and consequently wide of beam. She wore a large mast, but the head in her keel was ample enough to prevent her from passing, unless under full sail in a very heavy wind. The cabin was quite large and richly furnished, because the Sutters were a family of means, and wanted all the best."
"One after the other, the boys entered the opening beyond. At first, they saw little, but little by little, their eyes get used to the darkness and they built a rock chamber about twelve feet wide and fled irregularly for about a hundred feet or more. At times, the ceiling was so low that they had to fall down, while elsewhere it was well above their reach. The ground was quite flat, with rocks in some places and hard dirt in others. The opening was roughly furnished with a heavy table and a bench, and near a wall was a box bed, always filled with pine branches. On a large wooden hook hanging a man's coat, so it began to collapse when they touched it."
"The three boys of Rover walked to the open door of the old mill and went inside. Dick led the way and crossed to the place where a closed staircase ran down to the ground below. On the dots he went down, not relying on a step until he was sure of his foot. He did so well, for two of the steps were completely rotten, and he had to warn his brothers, if not one or the other could have had a fall."
"In the past year, a room had been added to the house and was used as a library and kind of a combined office, with a large safe and two roulette offices. One of the offices was used exclusively by Anderson Rover for his private letters and papers. When he was ill, the man had given Dick the extra key to the office, telling him to keep it. The father trusted his three sons implicitly, only doing business as he thought they were not interested. The boys sat down and, under Dick's leadership, began a thorough inspection of the numerous letters and documents contained in the roulette office. A large number of documents and letters they knew were unrelated to the current case."
"Meanwhile, Ruth Stevenson and May Powell, accompanied by Alice Strobell, Annie Larkins and some of their friends from Clearwater Hall, had arrived in the city and went to several stores on various races. Then, a few minutes before the scheduled time to meet the cadets, they rushed into the direction of the moving picture theatre. Several girls went to a pharmacy near the theatre, leaving Ruth and May standing on the sidewalk, looking at the various gourd billboards that were displayed there. The girls spoke of the image of a well-known moving actress, when suddenly Ruth felt a touch on her arm. Turning, she found herself confronted with a young tall, very strong, and accompanied by another boy, wearing a fur cap and a fur-lined overcoat."
"The morning of his great race with Mr. Turtle, Jimmy Rabbit was at the bright stream and early. He brought his two brothers with him, to see the pleasure. And he found that there were others, too, who had heard about the sport and had come to enjoy it. Frisky Squirrel was there, and Billy Woodchuck, and Fatty Coon. Then there was old Mr. Crow, who was still in hand when a crowd gathered. And perhaps the most enjoyable and interested of all was Tommy Fox. ""I hope you'll let me take a ride on your new sled when the first snow comes,"" he told Jimmy Rabbit. ""Because, of course, you're going to win the race. And Mr. Turtle will have to give you the trail, as he promised."" ""I'll see,"" said Jimmy."
"Simon Screecher lived in the apple orchard, in a hollow tree, where he could sleep during the day sheltered from the attack by crowds of small birds, who had the best reasons to dislike him. At night, Simon wandered into the fields and the woods, looking for mice and insects. And since the night was the time when Dickie Deer Mouse was awake, standing and doing, it would have been amazing if both had never met. One thing is certain: Dickie Deer Mouse was not eager to meet Simon Screecher. Every time he heard Simon's call, he stopped and listened. If it sounded closer to his ears, Dickie Deer Mouse quickly hid in a convenient place."
"There was a lot of excitement in the area of Farmer Green's house. Rusty Wren had found some strange leads. And no one knew who they were. Now, when they were puzzled as the field- and the people of the forest- were usually going straight to Mr. Crow for advice. But this time, it had happened that the old gentleman had gone to an excursion across Blue Mountain, where Brownie Beaver lived. And there seemed to be no one else at hand who would be able to explain the mystery. Being very old, Mr. Crow was very wise. And people often sought his opinion, although later they fell into the habit of consulting Dad Longlegs on issues they did not understand."
"Of all the creatures that walked, swam or flew, Timothy Turtle loved boys the least of all. He said that if they did something, except to throw stones, he had never caught them. ""It's a wonder"" — he often noticed — it's a wonder that there's a stone left anywhere along this stream. I lived here for good years; and no boy ever spied on me by dazzling me on a rock in the water without trying to hit me."" Once in a great moment, a young man was skillful enough to bounce a stone on Mr. Turtle's back. And when the old camp freaked out in the water, he always heard a great storm from the bank."
"The next time she saw Mr. Meadow Mouse, Ms. Robin gave her Grandpa Mole's message. ""He said, ""He would like to have a conversation with you."" ""Does he?"" exclaimed Mr. Meadow Mouse. ""Now I wonder what he has to say to him! I gave him his umbrella, after the rain. So, he can't be that way."" ""If I wanted to know, I would go to Grandpa Mole,"" suggested Ms. Robin. As a gentle person, Mr. Meadow Mouse politely thanked Ms. Robin, both for the message and for the advice. And then, swindling at a certain place he knew, near the fence, he disappeared by an opening in the ground. It was one of Grandpa Mole's doors. Mr. Meadow Mouse did not hesitate to use it, being one of those wealthy people who were at home anywhere."
"A board floated on the swollen waters of Black Creek. On it was seated master Meadow Mouse. He was very happy. He had his first tower, of all kinds. ""This raft—"" he proudly said—""this raft belongs to me. I will be a traveller. I will see the world — at least to the great willow at the lower end of the meadow!"" He hardly cared to go beyond the great willow. Beyond there was another farm. And Master Meadow Mouse had never been out of Farmer Green's place in all his life. He feared that he would not be able to find his way, if he ventured too far from his home. Soon he spied on a friend on the bank of the stream. Master Meadow Mouse wept, ""Goodby!"" and waved a foot on him. The person on the shore was one of his many cousins. And when he saw Master Meadow Mouse he looked hard for a few moments."
"There was a terrible hubbub in the henhouse. The Rooster calmed down so much that he woke up all the chickens from the square. And when they heard him cry that a skunk had hit him from his roof that they were as scared as he was, and put in a wild bag. Everything except Henrietta Hen! She knew there was no skunk there. ""Don't be a goose—don't be a maniac!"" she whistled at the Rooster. ""I'm the one who hit you."" The Rooster quickly came to his senses. ""Don't worry, ladies!"" he called the flock. ""There was no danger. There was a slight mistake."" He claimed he wasn't afraid. But he had been. And now he was a little bad about Henrietta Hen."
"In the same pasture with Snowball was a black lamb. It was the black lamb that Farmer Green had given Johnnie for a pet. But he fled on the way the very first time Johnnie tried to hold him in his arms. After that, the black lamb had always stayed with the herd. He was a wild man, undisciplined, taller and older than Snowball. And he was very frank – and not always careful of his tongue. This black lamb had the chance to be near Snowball when Johnnie Green came into the pasture a certain beautiful morning. And when Johnnie started calling Snowball the black lamb said, ""Why not run the other way? That's what I always do when the boys call me."" Snowball didn't answer."
"From a rocky hill above me, the baboons barked. Right below us was a fair stream with a rich grove of native trees on the upper bank. Some native gardens climbed on the slope above. The white path shrouded through them, then far among the rocks, some of them very large. As I looked at the stream, I saw a white body of fog rise. Just at that time the sun ascended. Looking at the sacred view, I saw someone go down the path. He was the man whose mission station I was looking for. He came through the long pressed grass. Soon he splashed through the drift."
"Just as the front of the car was approaching, Frank Merriwell received a push from behind which sent him flat on the track directly in front of the wheels of the car! This private car had no wings, and it seemed that Frank had to be massacred under the wheels. The rider saw the boy go down and put the hard brake, but he could not stop the car in time. Frank realized that he had been pushed on the track by someone whose goal was to mutilate or kill him, but he could not escape. He hit the paving, and the iron wheels seemed straight on him. But Jack Diamond moved with wonderful speed."
"Frank's success as an actor had been phenomenal. Of course, to begin with, he had a natural ability, but it was not the only thing that earned him success. He had courage, push, determination, tenacity. When he started doing something he kept until he did it. Frank united observation and study. He learned everything he could on the stage and to act by talking with the members of the company and looking at how things were done. He had a good head and a lot of sense. He knew better than copying after the ordinary actors of the road company to which he belonged. He had seen good deeds enough to distinguish good from evil. It happened that the bad models of him did not exert pernicious influence on him."
"An electric Hansom, who had sailed through the street in an eminently respectable manner, had suddenly and without apparent reason started to act in a completely disputable way. He had deviated, rushed over the crossing, and had made a bee for the sidewalk, almost running a part of Frank Merriwell's friends, who were out for an afternoon walk into the street in the pleasant spring sun. The biker, who occupied a large stand seat at the back, seemed to have lost control of the car. He was excited by his levers, but was not able to stop the car. The street was crowded with people at the time, and when the electric car began to cut off his eccentric captors there was a rush to safety places, while the air was filled with excited screams and exclamations. Merriwell could see the head of a passenger, a man, through the window of the automobile."
"Ditson had inflamed himself around Browning a lot since he entered college, so that the second-year king had come to entertain a feeling of absolute disgust for the man. Ditson's very sight made the ""king"" feel as if he liked to give him a good ""polishing."" But Bruce was not tyrannical, although he was a leader of the second. He had proved his ability to fight when it was necessary, but no one could say that he had ever shown any inclination to do bodily harm to the weak and peaceful one. In his first year Browning had given birth to a number of wild projects for sport, and he had always managed to get them through."
"Their horses had been fastened near them, and they were soon ascended and ascended to Mendoza. The sun beat hotly on the plain of white sand, and the sky was of a bright blue, as Frank had never seen elsewhere. Outside Mendoza was a narrow canal, but a few feet wide, and half filled with water, from which there were few whirlwinds of hot steam. On the side of the canal was a wall of stunned rough stone, fringed with bushes in strips and tufts. Beyond the canal, which fixed the boundary of the plain of sand, through the view of the trunks of trees, one could see glimpses of brown fields, disappearing in pale pink, purple and green. The dome and the towers of a church rose against the dim blue; lower, and on each side were spots of cream white, red, and yellow, with spots of dark green intervening, revealing pieces of the city, with tufts of oranges all around."
"As we have already said, there were four orphans; the oldest two were boys, and the youngest were girls. Edward, the eldest boy, was between thirteen and fourteen years old; Humphrey, the second, was twelve years old; Alice, eleven; and Edith, eight. As it is the story of these young men that we are about to tell, we will hardly speak of them at this time, except for many months they had been little or no restraint, and less attendance. Their companions were Benjamin, the man who remained in the house, and the old Jacob Armitage, who spent all the time he could spare with them. Benjamin was rather weak in intelligence, and was a source of fun rather than others."
"I direct my eyes to the north. I see a belt of white sand that runs along the blue water. I turn south, and in this direction I perceive a similar belt. At both points it extends beyond the reach of the vision, hundreds of miles beyond, forming, like a ribbon of silver, the selvage of the Mexican sea. It separates the turquoise blue from the water of the emerald green of the forest, contrasting with each one by its dazzling whiteness. Its surface is far from being at its level, as usual with the ocean-tranche. On the contrary, its millions of sparkling atoms, rendered light by the burning sun of the tropic, were lifted on the wings of the wind, and thrown into hills and ridges of hundreds of feet high, and stretching in all directions like the crowns of a great snow drift."
"Nature has formed animals that rejoice in living there, and are never found in more fertile areas. Two creeping creatures find their livelihood on the mosses and lichens that cover their cold rocks: they are caribou (the reindeer) and muskox. These, in turn, become the food and subsistence of the prey creatures. The wolf, in all its varieties of grey, black, white, foot, and dark, follows on their path. The brown bear, a large species, almost like grizzly, is only found in the lands of Barren; and the large musk bear (Zibethi fibre) comes within their borders, but the latter is a resident on their shores, and finds its food among the finny tribes of the seas that surround them. In the marshy ponds, existing here and there, the muskrat (Zibethi fibre) builds his house, like that of his great cousin, the beaver."
"Despite the many losses and crosses of his past life, he contented himself with his eye. He was gratified by the prosperous appearance of his crops. The corn was now ""in the milk"", and the ears, folded in the defenses of the papyrus, looked full and great. He was delighted to hear the rustling of the long green blades, and to see the brilliant golden rusts waving in the breeze. The farmer's heart was happy when his eye looked at his promising harvest of ""meals."" But there was another promising harvest that was still more rejoicing from his heart, his beautiful children. There, they are all around him. Hans, the oldest, the soberest, Hans, at work in the well-stocked garden; while the little Jan, the smallest, looks, and sometimes helps his brother. Hendrik, the Hendrik in shredding, with shiny hair and a light frilt, is occupied among the horses, in the ""kraal"" and Trüey, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the cat, the"
"It is true that, for a traveller approaching the Himalayas from any part of the great plain of India, these mountains present the appearance of a single range, continuously extending along the horizon from east to west. It is an optical illusion; and, instead of a range, the Himalayas can be considered as a set of mountain ridges, covering an area of 200,000 square miles, and running in as many different directions as there are points in the compass. In the circumference of this vast mountain range, there is a great variety of climates, soils and productions. Among the lower hills—the hills adjacent to the plains of India—as well as in some of the deepest valleys of the interior—the flora is of a tropical or subtropical character."
"Patty remembered his visit to their summer home, which they called the Hurly-Burly, and she couldn't see that their urban residence deserved that name less. His aunt Grace and uncle Ted were happy people, in a good mood, who didn't care about the system or the method in their home. The result was that things were often wrong, but nobody cared especially if they did. ""I wanted to have a more enjoyable lunch for you, Patty,"" said her aunt, ""because they were sitting at the table, but the cook forgot to order lobsters, and when I phoned for fresh peas, the grocer said I was too late, because they were all sold."
"It was with good luck that the Bryants were there to take the initiative, because Mr. and Mrs. Maynard seemed unable to act. Usually alert and energetic, they were so amazed at the idea of a real disaster for Marjorie that they sat around me powerless inactive. ""Come with me, King,"" said Cousin Jack, going to the phone in the library. Then he called every house in Seacote where Marjorie could have gone, and King helped suggest the names of the acquaintances. But no one could give any news of the little girl; no one they asked had seen or heard about her that afternoon. Cousin Jack's face grew very white, and his features were drawn, as he said, ""You stay here, Ed, with Helen and Ethel; King and I will come out a little bit. Come, King."" Kingdon said nothing; he removed his hat and silently followed the sides of Mr. Bryant, trying to follow the long and quick steps of his companion."
"She admitted herself that she had probably had a good time, as she always did everywhere, but that she always had a heart attached to the ""Pebbles"", as she was called their coastal house, and that she had silently rebelled when she thought of ""Camilla"", her little quick electric runabout. Patty drove her own car, and she was never tired of turning along coastal roads, or inside the pine and laurels forests. She had met many young people, both cottage owners and hotel guests, and the prospect of a pleasant summer and autumn at Spring Beach was all that could be desired from her point of view. But before they left the city in the spring, Patty knew that Nan preferred mountain localities and had accepted the coastal house for her own good; so now it was Patty's turn to give her preference for Nan. And she was going to do it, oh, yes, she was going to do it with joy and gay."
"At eight o'clock in the evening, Patty went down to her own evening. An hour's rest had refreshed her wonderfully, and she had changed her little white pants for a light green muslin dinner dress, sparkling with silver embroidery. She followed behind her in a very adult way, and she entered the living room with an exaggerated look of dignity.""Huh,"" cried Roger; ""look at Patty, an adult! Isn't that the arrogant woman? Patty, if you put on such airs, you will be old before your time!"" ""Airs, nothing!"" retorted Patty, and with a small leap of dancing, she went through the room, took a couch pillow, and directed her to Roger, who took her on the wing. ""It's better,"" he said. ""We can't have any of these great lady looks. Now, who's the lucky man who's taking you to dinner?"
"Frank knew immediately that he was discovered. He had stopped perfectly, in the hope that he could escape observation; but when he saw the other one taking the heels, he realized that he was now destined to be a stern hunt. Thus, too, he began to run at the higher speed, which meant a warm rhythm, since Frank was something to sprint on the ashtray path. At least this turn on the other side had told him one thing — it was not a Columbia that had played this wretched trick on the football team; so without a doubt he must belong to Clifford. Despite the efforts of the school authorities, there was always more or less betting on these games."
"In the same moment, without a word to each other, Dave, Darrin and Dalzell had done the same thing. That is, they started running and at the same time devoured coats and vests, leaving these clothes to float behind them. When they reached the sail, the two midshipmen threw their shoes. Dave jumped into the boat while Dalzell threw the bowl, and then boarded. Like a flash, the two young men went to tear off the main veil. ""There is no reef in it,"" discovered Dan. ""Going to take time for a nearby reef, Dave? ""There is no time,"" Darrin murmured, with drops of cold sweat on his forehead as he launched. ""We will have to go out under a complete veil, Dan."" ""Grand Scott!"" murmured Dalzell. ""We could be too late to save someone as he is."
"He grabbed himself on the end of the toe, Dave was waiting for the ball to come. Wells, with a nasty smile, signaled for a ball that he felt sure to catch Dave painting. Earlier in the game, he could have done it, but Ted's right wing was now collapsing. Hi did his best, but Dave hit and flanked the leather. In the Greg race, while Dick had a time of flocking on his way to the third. Dave reached the first in a lot of time. Two men came out, leaving the nine equals. Dick now fainted in the third. ""I wish someone else that Henderson was going to beat,"" he moaned in front of Prescott. However, Spoff had the honor of his school desperately in the heart. He did his best, looking with a cool judgment and supported by an iron determination to make his mark. The third strike he hit. He had enough to get a shot in front of Prescott. Dick seemed to hit the ball with the speed."
"The introductions concluded, Hawkins followed the young engineers into their room while the drummers went to their own more expensive quarters and packed their business in haste. Fifteen minutes later, the party was standing in the office and carrying the trunks. Tom and Harry, keeping most of their stuff at the camp, had only suitcases to carry. ""Gentlemen, I think you're making a mistake,"" began Mr. Ashby, as he met the vendors in the lobby near the clerk's office. ""We made a mistake coming here,"" he retorted the salesman, nicely in the tone, ""but we're correcting him now."
"After some work, Tom managed to reduce the chocolate to a consistency that admitted to pour it, although very slowly. ""It took you almost three minutes to pour out two cups,"" said Harry, turning his watch to his pocket. ""Come on, now! We have to make up for lost time. What will Don Luis think of us? And yet it is his household arrangements that keep us away from our work."" The chocolate and the rolls were quickly eliminated. Then the two engineers sat back, wondering if Nicolas had deserted them. Finally, the two rose and walked to stretch their legs. ""No restaurant in New York has anything on this place for a slow marc service!"" grew Hazelton. As all things must come at last, so Nicolas. He wore a tray and was followed by a second servant, bringing another. The tortillas turned out, as Harry said, ""a cross between a biscuit and a flack."""
"Darrin had dressed for breakfast the following morning, but there was still a few minutes before the call came to the mess of the service room. ""My compliments to the captain, and I will report immediately,"" replied Ensign Dave. Turning, he put his sword and shot his white gloves. Then, at a glance, he left his quarters, walking abruptly towards the captain's quarters. Captain Gales, at his office, received the young ensign's greeting. On the desk he placed the papers in the case of the previous night. ""Teacher, I passed the papers in last night's case,"" began the ""old man,"" as the commander of a naval ship is called, when he is not present. ""Yes, sir?"" The captain's face was inexpressive; it was impossible to say what was going on in his mind. ""I paid attention to your report, and also to Lieutenant Cantor's. I spoke with Mr. Carmody, and I asked Coxswain some questions."
"The camp was half a mile from the edge of the water, on a low hill. Here the men of the outfit were settled. There had been mutiny murmurings among some of the men, but so far there had been no open revolt. Tom, however, who had had considerable experience in such things, sought a certain form of trouble before the smoking excitement calmed down. Thus Harry. On that dark night Tom had proposed that he and his buddy walk on the shorefront to see if everything was going well there. Shortly after leaving the camp, the young engineers had started on a jog-trot. Just before they reached the edge of the water, the wind had carried to their ears the weak relation of what was to be an explosion over the waters of the Gulf."
"This unlucky bird did not sit in this way long before some boys, who had brought the haymen their dinners, and went home, saw him in the hedge, and immediately began to try to catch him. But if he could not fly, he could float, and if he was not able to run, at least he could jump; so every time one of the boys approached him, the chick would scramble up to the next branch, and therefore from the branch to the branch throughout the hedge. If the boys had not known how terribly scared the poor little bird was, they could never have been as cruel as hunting him that way. They did not know, however, and only his idea of catching him. Finally, he had arrived at the end of the hedge, then he rushed to the field with the boys after him."
"Tom and his crowd looked at the way and saw two other new arrivals approaching. Apparently, they were very different from the trembling boy, half frozen who had just gone along the way. They were warmly clothed, wearing caps and sealskin gloves, and there was something in their air that proclaimed them to be boys who respected each other, and who heard that others respected them. One of them was large and wide, and was as if he had never been accustomed to submit to any absurdity, and the other was small, thin, and apparently delicate. ""Why, it is the Planter and his brother,"" said one of the students, all having had the opportunity to learn more or less about the boys who made up the fourth class. ""They are Mississippi. Their father is not worth the end of the money, and they say that he gives his boys a very liberal allowance."""
"Dick Slater and Bob Estabrook descended from Broadway and had almost reached Bowling Green when Dick saw the man in the bell hat that was approaching. He obviously took Dick for his friend at first, as he advanced quickly, then stopped suddenly, looked at the two boys, blushing, and, turning on his heel, darted on the other side of Broadway and on Pearl Street, where he disappeared. Dick was immediately after him, but when he reached Pearl Street, nothing was to be seen from the spy. The boys went down to Whitehall wharf, where they could see further on to Staten Island, where the British ships seemed to be preparing for a change of position. The day was fast, and since they could not get any additional information at the wharf, they turned their faces towards the city and went to a good jogging to the Communes, where the camp was located."
"He was once the youngest son of a king filled with desire to go abroad and see the world. He obtained permission from his father to leave, kissed his parents good-bye, climbed his black horse, and galloped on the high road. Soon the grey towers of the old castle in which he was born hid behind him. The prince spent days on a journey, and nights in the small inns of road, until one day he found himself in the heart of the Adamant mountains. The great cliffs of red granite from the surrounding peaks rose from the dazzling snow like ugly fingers, and the slopes of the giant glaciers shone in the sun like torrents of diamonds. The prince sat by a few rough trees whose top had long been broken by an avalanche, and began to eat the piece of bread and cheese he had stored in his pocket. His black horse, during that time, ate the grass growing here and there along the mountain path."
"The fisherman thanked the king of the caves, and took the silver fish. It was about the length of your little finger, and he had pale moonstones for his eyes. The fisherman hung the talisman on a chain and carried it around his neck. From this morning, everything prospered with youth. His boat never escaped, he was never caught in a storm, and the fish came to his lines and nets as soon as he threw them overboard. In a year or two, he had grown so rich that he could buy the most beautiful merchant ship in the world, and become a master sailor."
"Seeing the entrance door open, the enchanter entered. It was very quiet. It was only heard the klingle-klangle distant from a cow's bell. ""Behold, I will live,"" said the enchanter. ""And he brought his goods to the house. Now, one autumn morning, when a blue mist hanged over the solitary fields from which the reapers had left, and the gold leaves were wet under the feet, the former enchanter went on to walk on the way, and found the day pleasant, continued until he found himself in the woods. Arriving at the crest of a small hill in the forest, he saw under him, almost at the foot of the slope, a campagnard with a white puppy and a black kitten that followed his heels. The little dog barked joyfully out of pure spirits, while the kitten jumped and struck with his small legs with white butterflies passing by."
"From Toledo to Ft Wayne, our next stop, there were two itineraries, the north passing through Bryan and the south passing through Napoleon and Defiance. As there did not seem to be much difference between them, we played ""John Kempo"" and the north road won, two out of three. As we were heading our way through the streets of the city, an old woman tried to cross the street right in front of the Glow worm. Nyoda rang the horn, but the noise seemed to confuse it. She crossed the middle of the street safely and Nyoda accelerated a little, when the woman lost her head and began to return to the side she had come from."
"Sahwah looked at the progress of the milk, and the doorkeeper stopped with her near the lieutenant of the aviation. The lieutenant seemed asleep, because the doorkeeper had to shake him before he realized his existence. Hinpoha then took Sahwah's eye and pushed her back to his seat, and Sahwah went down the alley to join his friends. She looked closely at the young lieutenant when he passed by; he stared at her and let her fall her eyes quickly. A little electric shock mingled with her while she met her eyes; he seemed to be about to talk to her."
"Agony's eyes went into the group around Pom-pom and rested on the girl who, next to Pom-pom herself, was the centre of the group. She was very similar to Agony herself, to the very black hair, to the snowy white forehead and to the richly red lips, although a little lighter in the construction and a little bigger. A frank kindness shone with her dark eyes and her smile was warm and sincere. Agony felt attracted to her and jealous of her at the same time. The most popular girl in the camp. It was the title Agony coveted with all her soul. Being prominent; being popular, was the main goal of Agony in life; and being pointed in a crowd as the most popular thing in the world seemed to be the most desirable thing in the world for her. She too, would be prominent and popular, she resolved; she too, would be pointed out in the crowd."
"The dark growth of oak and pine suddenly separated and the lithic figure of a boy about seventeen years old suddenly emerged in the small clearing. The boy who had materialized so abruptly from the near vegetation proper to the area around the small town of Hampton, on the south shore of Long Island, wore a well-fitted brown khaki uniform, canvas leggings of the same colour and a soft hat of the country variety, mounted on one side. At the front of his head was fixed a metal badge, resembling the three-pointed arrowhead used on old maps to indicate the north. On a metal roller under it were engraved the words: ""Be prepared."" The manner of the insignia's attachment would immediately have indicated to anyone who knew the organization that the boy was wearing the patrol head of the local Boy Scouts Band."
"You have already met Theodore, Teddy or Ted Martin, and his sister Janet, or Jan. Together with their mother, they were spending the long summer vacation at Cherry Farm, Grandfather Martin's country house outside the town of Elmburg, near Clover Lake. Mr. Richard Martin, or Dick, as Grandfather Martin called him, owned a store in Cresco, where he lived with his family. Besides Ted and Jan there was Baby William, about three years old. His name was Trouble, for the reason I told you, although Mother Martin called him ""Dear Trouble"" to catch up with Ted and Jan sometimes pissed against him."
"He started looking around the edge of the stone, and what did he see? Why, there was a pretty little red squirrel girl, and she had a comb and a brush, and a little glass. And the glass was stuck on a stump where the moon beam that Uncle Wiggily was following shone on and reflected again. And in the light of the moon beam, the red squirrel painted and brushed her tail as strong as she could paint and brush. ""What are you doing?"" asked Uncle Wiggily by surprise. ""Oh, my! How did you surprise me!"" cried the red squirrel. ""But I'm glad it was you, Uncle Wiggily. I'm going to a surprise party soon, and I was just trying to make my tail as big as Johnnie or Billie Bushytail's, but I can't do it."""
"But before going to school on Monday, the brother and sister saw that the glass-covered box in which the tomato plants would soon develop, was put in a sunny window. On the way to school, they looked into the large courtyard of Mr. Porter who lived next door. He was picking up dried leaves and grass and a little boy with red hair was looking at him. ""Hello, little ones!"" called Mr. Porter. ""You've already started your garden?"" ""Not yet,"" replied Hal. ""But we planted tomato seeds in the house,"" said Mab. ""Yes, and I have to do so too. We'll see who will have the best garden,"" went on Mr. Porter. ""How's your poodle dog?"" ""Oh, we had tomato seeds closed in the house,"" said Mab. ""Yes, and I have to do it."
"Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice old rabbit, came out of the underground burrow of the Littletail family, where he was visiting for a while with the Bunny, Sammie and Susie children, because his own hollow bungalow had burned. ""Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?"" asked Sammie Littletail, the rabbit, while he was shaking his cabbage leaf books, ready to go to school. ""Oh, I'm just going to take a little walk,"" replied Uncle Wiggily. ""Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat's maid, asked me to bring him plaster from the courtyard of the five and six hundred stores, and on my way I could have an adventure. Who knows?"" said Susie. ""Do you want to walk a part of the way with us, Uncle Wiggily?"" ""To be sure I'm going!"""
"The next morning, Ethel Hollister approached Barnard and applied for admission. The following week, during her first exam, she failed, but she entered the class with conditions. The girl was studying hard and doing good soon. She liked the girls in her class. They were intelligent, athletic and pleasant. Her former friends and companions at La Rue said that, in fact, since she had become a girl of campfire – Ethel Hollister had developed fashions. This Barnard was one. But as Ethel was making steady progress at university, and she was so young – not yet seventeen – people began to consider her as a girl of great ability and intelligence. Mrs. Hollister became proud to hear her praises from all sides and Archibald seemed less concerned about money issues. She was rather happy that things had changed."
"Rollo sat on the tokens, and began to pick them up, all around him, and to throw them into his basket. He filled it quickly, then he filled it up, the emptiness in the tokenhole, then he returned, and began to fill it again. He had not obtained his basket more than half full the second time, before he came on very large tokens, which were so square and flat, that he thought they would be good to build houses with. He thought he would just try them a little, and he began to hold them up so as to make the four walls of a house. However, he found an unexpected difficulty; for although the tokens were large and square, but the edges were so sharp that they would not get up very well. A certain time was spent trying out experiences with them in various ways; but he could not very well succeed; so he began to put them back in his basket."
"The city – which was the origin of London – is the oldest. It was founded long before the days of the Romans; so long, in fact, that its origin is completely unknown. Nothing is known about the derivation or meaning of the name. As far as Westminster is concerned, the name is known to come from the word minister, which means cathedral, a cathedral church having been built there very early, and which, west of London as it did, was called the minister of the West. This church has passed through a great variety of mutations during the period of successive centuries, having grown, and has been rebuilt, and enlarged, and rebuilt, and modified, times and ways without number. It is represented in the present age by the venerable pile - the place of burial of ancient kings, and of the most distinguished noble, general, and statesmen of the English monarchy - known throughout the world as Abbey of Westminster."
"Looking at any map of Europe, we will see that England is separated from France by the English Channel, a passage which, although it seems rather narrow on the map, is really very wide, especially towards the west. The narrowest place is between Dover and Calais, where the distance across is only about twenty-two miles. This narrow passage is called the Strait of Dover. It would have been very convenient for travellers who have to pass between London and Paris if this strait had been in the line, or almost in the line, between these two cities; but it does not. It is very much to the east of it; so that, to cross the canal at the narrowest part, it would have been necessary for the traveller to take a whole circuit. To go to the shortest distance, it is necessary to cross the canal at a place where Dieppe is the port, on the French side, and New Haven on the English."
"The reason why there are so many paintings and sculptures in Italy is as follows: in the Middle Ages, it was the fashion, in all the central parts of Europe, for people to spend almost all their surplus in the construction and decoration of churches. Indeed, there was then very little else they could do. At present, people invest their funds, as quickly as they accumulate them, in the construction of ships and railways, of docks for the storage of goods, houses and shops in the cities, to leave for the good of the rental, and of country seats, or pretty private residences of various kinds, for themselves."
"The stages in France are very large, and are divided into different compartments, with a different price for each. There were usually three compartments below and one above. In the Italian stages, however, or at least in the one in which Mr. George and Rollo went to Rome, there were only three. First there were the interior, or the body of the coach. Directly before this compartment, with a glass front, containing only one seat, which looked forward; there were, of course, seats for three people on that seat. This front compartment is called the coupe. It is considered the best in the diligence. There is also a seat above the coupe, in a sort of second story, and it is the seat that Mr. George and Rollo generally preferred, because it was high, where they could see better. But for the current trip Mr. George thought that the seat up, which is called the banquet, would not be safe enough; because although it was covered above and was still more exposed with a kind of roof, it was still more exposed."
"Geneva is located on the borders of France, Switzerland and Sardinia, at the exit of Lake Geneva, which is perhaps the most beautiful, and certainly the most famous, Lake Switzerland. It is shaped as a crescent, that is, as the new moon, or rather as the moon after it is about four or five days. The lower end of the lake, that is, the end where Geneva is located, is located in a relatively open country, although large massifs of high mountains, some covered with perpetual snow, are visible in the distance all around. However, the whole near country, at this end of the lake, is gently undulating, and it is extremely fertile and beautiful. There are many elegant country seats along the shore of the lake, and on the banks of the Rhône, which come out of it. The waters of the lake at this end, and of the river emanating from it, are very clear, and of a deep and beautiful blue color."
"In observing this, Rollo observed that from time to time a name was called by an employee behind the office, and that some people who were waiting on the seats were getting up and going to the place. After stopping there for a few minutes, he took his passport and carried it into an inner room at another office, where something was done to him. Then, he took it to another place, where it was stamped once or twice by a man who seemed to have nothing else to do but stamp the passport of each body when they were going out. Looking at this process in the case of others, Rollo knew exactly what to do when his name was called; so that, in about half an hour from the moment he entered the office, he had the satisfaction of getting out and entering his car with the passports all for travel to Switzerland."
"""Well, it's the fourth day that we went out, and nothing yet does, Frank!"" Bob spoke sadly, as if the unsuccessful search started to touch him a little. The nature of the boys was so different; and while the young Kentuckian had many beautiful qualities that his boyfriend admired, but he was not so persistent as Frank. Nothing could ever tarnish the boy of the Circle Ranch. Difficulties, he believed, were only launched to bring out the best parts of his nature. The more a man found himself ""against him,"" as Frank called problems of encounter halfway, the stronger became his character. ""Oh! Well, now, Bob, I wouldn't say that,"" he replied to his boyfriend's complaint. ""Just think about what we've made huge progress. And if the worse comes, he didn't say Charley Me that it was only a week now before he needed another stock of things to eat, and better wait for the meeting, and we don't have to see the meeting, and we don't have to wait for the meeting."
"Most cowboy ponies are taught to do this trick by their masters, and it is common practice; so that the punchers believe that it is a poor animal that has not learned to ride and play dead on occasion. Bob, too, managed to induce his mount to do the same thing; but to make absolutely sure that no imprudent floppy on Domino's part could betray them, he sat on the head of the horse, soothing him by small peas on his shiny skin. ""I hear them coming,"" Frank said, at the moment. The sounds came to him against the wind, so it was natural to believe that the horses approaching should now be very close. There was a confused buzzing that could only spring from a large body of animals."
"As they were poor, because of the amount of milk that the children drank, this nurse was a major Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had not belonged to anyone in particular until the Darlings hired her. She had always thought that the children were important, however, and the Darlings had become familiar with her in the Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her free time searching in parambulators, and was very hated by careless nurses who followed home and complained about their mistresses. She turned out to be a nurse's treasure."
"A brilliant October morning just broke when a last bump on the train ended the musical snoring of Slim Goodwin and he came to a sitting posture, his first yawning almost instantly to give way to an exclamation of surprise. It was a strange landscape that he was looking at, and for the moment he had forgotten where he was. Joe and Jerry's smiling faces, which he had woken up half an hour before with his sleepy sawmill serenade, led him to a realization of his environment. ""Where are we?"" he asked, now fully awake. ""I imagine it's Philadelphia,"" answered Joe, although I've never been there."" ""Well, let's go up and see,"" was a suggestion from Jerry who found a ready answer in the other two; and a moment later, when half of the passengers were still sleeping, they were investigating the mysteries of Washington Avenue, near Broad Street, in Quaker City."
"Perhaps he did not see the hive for a long time, but he would have heard it, far from the sight in the endless sky, thrilling and thrilling until the world seemed to have no sound other than this clear sweetness; and what a world he was to make that sound! Whistles and chirps, coos and caws and croaks, would have become familiar to him. And he could have finally said which brother of the great brotherhood made the noise that he heard at all times. The wind also: he would have listened to his thousand voices as he was moving in all seasons and in all moods. Perhaps a horse would wander in the thick screen around his house, and would look as solemnly on Fionn as Fionn on her. Or, suddenly coming on him, the horse could look, all a peacock with eyes and ears and nose, a long facial extension, he turned around and limited himself with screams all around him and hoofs all around him."
"Marcia's eyes were rather blurred while she was speaking, and anyone could see that it was a difficult task that she had taken on. It is never easy to admit that one was in evil, and it was particularly difficult for these girls, whose entire campaign against the fire camp had been based on pride and a false feeling of their own superiority, which, of course, existed only in their imagination. For a moment no one seemed to know what to do or to say. It was strangely Dolly, who had felt the previous attitude of rich girls more than any of her companions, who instinctively found the real solution. She did not say a word; she simply ran forward impulsively and threw her arms on Marcia's neck. Then, and not until then, as she kissed the friend with whom she had quarreled, she found words."
"""I never dreamed of such a room, Zara, you?"" Bessie King, his eyes open with admiration and wonder, asked him the question in a room in the house of Eleanor Mercer, Guardian of the Fire of the Camp of Manasquan, of the Daughters of the Camp of Fire. The two girls were new members of the organization, and Bessie, who had lived his whole life in the country, and had not known anything of the luxury and comfort that the girls of the city, or the luckiest of them, took almost as a question of course, had found something new to surprise him in almost every hour since they had come to the city. ""I dreamed of it, yes,"" said Zara. ""You see that I was in the city before, Bessie; and I saw houses like this, and I guess that the rooms inside must be something like that, although I never lived in one."
"The young girl of Meadow-Brook did not dare to go and enter the secret channel for fear of exposing the boat's hiding place. She looked at another corner in which to drive her boat. In case her pursuers discovered it, she decided to jump and escape as far as she could, leaving the boat on the beach. Then a sudden idea appeared to her. Harriet took a tin-dive that was in the boat and had been used for rescue. She threw herself as far into the lake as she could throw it. She fell down with a splash that she heard both by herself and by those in the boat. ""He is there!"" cried a voice in the other boat. Harriet heard the pursuers go out. Harriet took the opportunity to move her boat in front of a few stems. She then turned it abruptly towards the shore. The young girl had the chance to find a cover in the overhanging foliage."
"That night, after the lights were extinguished, Harriet gave a long thought to the events of the evening, beginning with the fire of the Council and ending with the little scene that had taken place in their tent. What was she to do? What was the honest way to follow? The girl could not decide. However, she made her decision, to consult Miss Elting the next morning. After breakfast at the first opportunity, she went looking for Miss Elting, but she learned that the guard with another of the camp's officials had started with Jasper to go to ""The Pines"", a summer watering place in the woods, about ten miles from Wau-Wau camp. This summer station was reached by a state road entering the woods from another direction, but the two young women took the route of the woods as the most direct one."
"It was really wonderful that the girls could work on such a transformation into themselves in such a short time. In the few moments that had been left to them, they had rearranged their hair, brushed the dirt from the field ploughed with their clothes and washed their faces and hands. It was really a happy dinner, too, for the guest of good nature made them all laugh with his humorous stories and strange remarks. He was so much like his daughter Jane that they didn't need to remember the relationship. ""It was a day of excitement, did it?"" said one of Miss Elting's guards."
"On Monday after the marching expedition, Grace Harlowe set out for the school full of an idea that had been running in her busy brain for weeks. The time had come for herself and her three chums to bond like a sorority. As charter members, they would initiate four other girls, as soon as appropriate rites could be thought. It should be a society of Greek letters. Grace thought that ""Phi Sigma Tau"" would sound well. Outside the social part, their main objective would be to keep a watchful eye for girls in school who need any kind of help. Mrs. Gray's anxiety about Eleanor Savel had put the bee in the buzz of Grace's hood, and now her plans were almost perfect. All that remained to be done was to tell her three friends, and to consult them on what four other girls would be eligible for membership."
"In the first two weeks of Overton's life, there were so many things to do to organize his recitations, buy or rent his books and get used to the routine of university life that Grace and his friends could barely spare the time to write their letters at home. There were twenty-four girls at Wayne Hall. With the exception of four sophores, the house was given to first-year people. Grace found them all charming, and in her whole soul, a generous way made the capital of their virtues and remained blind to their flaws. There had been a number of joy gatherings in Mrs. Elwood's living room, where quantities of fudge and penuchi were made and eaten and simple acquaintances became quick friends. The week after their arrival, a dance had been given in the gym in honor of first-year people."
"The summer sun, flowing intimately to the window of her room, and touching her hair with warm and waking fingers, made Grace open her eyes to her before six o'clock in the morning. She lay about her, unable to remember where she was. Then she laughed and approached her kimono, who clung to her at the foot of the bed, glided him, and, pushing her feet into her room slippers, went to the window. ""Dear Old Overton Hall,"" she muttered, lovingly staring at the grey tower of the building that she had come to regard as a close friend. Again, she found herself overwhelmed by a tide of memories. How often she and Anne had stood at the same window, arm in arm, looking at the views of herself. She could see the seat even at the foot of the great tree where she had sat the day Emma Dean had laid her head on the great syringa bush and had given her the letter of Ruth Denton's father with mourning for many weeks."
"Hippy tried to remember what had happened to him. He remembered to have climbed along the path; he remembered the teasing of the girls of Overland, and then at the same time the consciousness was erased. He had a weak memory of being scrambled, which was probably when he was carried on a horse, but that was the extent of his memories. He knew that his head was terribly hurt and that she felt twice his natural size. His throat was broken with thirst, but Lieutenant Wingate said that he would die rather than ask a favor from the ruffin who kept him. Shortly after the darkness, Hippy heard voices outside the cave; then two men came in, jerking him at his feet and pulling him out, throwing him on the back of a pony just in front of the saddle, as if he were a meal bag."
"While this was being done, Tom chose the camp ground; then cut and put four posts, the lower rear pair at the front, and through them he placed ridge posts. When the spruce shoots were brought, they were placed on the top of the frame thus erected, and within moments the roof was on. The ends of the spruce shoots were closed by spruce shoots suspended above them. The roof shoots were all placed in the same direction, the buttocks forward, the tops rearward. This accomplished green house had appeared to be magical, but it was not yet complete. The spruce shoots were brought and spread on the ground under the shoots about one foot deep, all of them laid on one side, soft and smelling so sweet that the air in the small house seemed to be intoxicating. Emma Dean dove in front of the camp."
"The three girls ran slightly out of the basement of the beautiful old building that was Oakdale's pride. It was large and imposing, built in smooth and grey stone, with four huge columns supporting the front porch. A hundred meters from there stood the companion building, the boys' high school, exactly like the first in all aspects, except that a wing had been added for a gymnasium that the girls had the privilege of using on some days. A large campus surrounded the two buildings, shaded by the elm and oaks. Certainly no other city in the state could boast of two higher schools as beautiful as these; and the situation mainly appealed to the people of Oakdale, for the ten acres of level around the two buildings gave ample space for the various fields of athletics, and the acts of the high schools formed the very life of the place."
"The juniors themselves did not feel the weight of their punishment more than Grace Harlowe. Her heart was set to win every basketball match in the series. But she wanted to win fairly and honestly. Now that the juniors had been banned from using the gym, the second ones could practice in their hearts. But was it right? To be sure that the juniors deserved their punishment, but what kind of basketball could they play after not practicing for two weeks? Besides, Julia Crosby criticized her for saying what had happened in the gym. She had gone to Julia, seriously admitting innocence, but Julia had only laughed at her and refused to listen. All this quickly passed into Grace's mind while she was walking to high school several mornings later. Something had to be done, but what she barely knew."
"Mrs. Stanhope occupied her father's house on the banks of the Rhine. She had married a very young Englishman, and had lived in England until her death, when she had returned to her childhood home, unoccupied since the death of her parents, bringing with her two little children, the Philo with brown eyes, and her delicate sister, Nora. The faithful Clarissa, who had taken care of Mrs. Stanhope in her childhood and had accompanied her to her foreign home, loved these children as if they were hers. The little family had now lived many years in this beautiful house on the Rhine; a very peaceful and regular life, one day like the other; because the children were delicate and could not carry any exciting pleasure. Two years ago, a great sadness left her dark shadow on the house. Little Philo closed her dark eyes forever, and was laid under the old lindentree in the garden, where the roses were blooming all summer. Nora, who was only a year younger than her brother, was now in her eleventh year."
"Martha knew quite well that she had to remind her girlfriend that she was coming home, because we had often forgotten the time and had to send Cornelli. But now the little girl began to run quickly in the inclination near the stream. Soon, she came to the large buildings from which the sound of whistles, blows and hammers were heard all day long. The noise was so great that only the roaring of the stream could drown him. Here are the works of the great iron foundry, well known from far and wide, since most of those who lived in the neighborhood found employment there. Glazing at the large doors and seeing that they were closed, Cornelli flew by them with great limits. In an isolated house, well raised above the stream, lived the owner of the foundry. Beautiful flower gardens were on three sides. Cornelli approached the open space opposite and was soon inside."
"Despite all the problems and the work of the grandmother, the years passed so quickly to her, that one day she began to think that she discovered that Sami must be seven years old. Then she thought it was really time for him to learn something. But suddenly, sending the boy to a French school when he did not understand a French word seemed terrible to him, because he would be as helpless as a chicken in the water. She preferred to try, as well as possible, to teach him to read. She thought it would be very hard but it would go quite easily. In a short time, the young man knew all his letters and could even put the words together."
"Several days had passed so, one exactly like the other. The sun had always brilliantly shined in a sky without clouds; always in the evening the friendly little star had slipped over the dark mountain. But one afternoon, thick and grey clouds continued through the sky; from time to time, blinding lightnings burst, and suddenly dreadful thunders sounded, resonating from the mountains, as if there were twice as many, then a terrible storm broke. It was as dark as the night; the rain was beating against the cabin, and during that time the thunder was rolling with terrible reverberations through the mountains; dreadful lightnings lit the dark and dreadful forms of the giants, which seemed to be increasingly spectres and looked threateningly."
"Sally ran with a joyful heart, first through the garden, then over the meadow and went down the hill to the firwood, where the dry road extended for a long time in the shade. Here, Sally slowed down a little. It was so beautiful to walk in the shade of the trees, where above their peaks the wind rolled so deliciously and all the birds sang in confusion. She also had to consider how she would arrange her calls, whether she went first to Kaetheli or Marianne; but this old Marianne had a stronger attraction than Kaetheli and Sally felt that she had to go first there and give her message. Now her thoughts fell on strange people and she had to imagine how they looked and what she was going to say, and what they would say when she struck and asked Marianne. So she thought all right, because Sally had a great power of imagination."
"Kurt also fled, but in the opposite direction, where he had discovered his mother. She stood in front of a rose from which she cut flowers and wilted twigs. Kurt was happy to find his mother occupied with a job that did not occupy her thoughts, because he often wanted such an opportunity without success. When he was eager to discuss her particular problems thoroughly and without being interrupted, his younger brother and sister were sure to interfere with their questions, or the two older children needed his advice at the same time. Kurt rushed into the garden to take advantage of this unusual opportunity. But still today, he was not destined to make his object come to his mother. Before arriving to his mother, a woman approached the other side, and both immediately entered into a lively conversation."
"Fred was not at all afraid, in fact, as he was leaving. Before crossing the mark that represented the border, he had been extremely depressed. He had been without a friend and alone. He had been worse than without a friend, indeed, since the only man on many kilometers who knew him was his bitter enemy. Now he had found that he could still inspire a man like Ernst with faith in his truth and honesty, and knowledge did him a lot of good. And then, of course, he had another excellent reason not to be afraid. He was totally unaware of the particular dangers that were before him. He had no idea what was before him, and he did not need courage to avoid fearing a danger whose very existence is completely unconscious."
"Their inspection of the South Cross ended, the delighted boys accompanied Captain Hazzard to the main cabin, where he moved in front of them a huge map of the polar regions. The map was drawn in many places with tiny red lines that made zig-zags and curves over the void of the region south of the eightieth parallel. ""These lines mark the points reached by different explorers,"" explains the captain. ""Here, the furthest south of Scott, and here the most recent advance in the polar regions of the South, Sir Ernest Shackleton's. In my opinion, Shackleton could have achieved his goal if he had used a sledge, capable of carrying heavy weights, and did not place his only dependence on ponies."" The drowned boys; Frank had read the explorer's story and realized that what Captain Hazzard had said was probably correct."
"The boy went to the well, filled him with water, and then returned home; but most of the water was broken before he came back. His cake was very small, but small as he was, his mother asked him if he was willing to take half of it with his blessing, telling him that if he chose to take it all, he would only get it with his curse. The young man, thinking that he might have to go a far way, and not knowing when or how he could get other provisions, told him that he would like to have all the cake, to come from his mother's malison, so she gave him all the cake, and her malison with him. Then he took his brother apart, and gave him a knife to keep him until he came back, wanting to look at him every morning, and as long as it was clear, then he could be sure that the owner of this one was good; but if he began to eat and to blush, then some sick came to him."
"When the Piper came out of the room, he came up on his lips, and a cunning air rang through the street and the house. And as each note pierced the air, you could have seen a strange spectacle. For, from every hole, the rats came to stumble. There was neither too old nor too young, nor too big, nor too small to tread the Piper's heels, with greedy feet and noses turned around to fight after him, for he was also not insensitive to the little children, for he stopped at every fifty meters and gave him a greater blooming on his pipe, just to give them time to follow the old and strongest of the band."
"Donald had made a beautiful polished shelf, and had screwed it outside of the board, and the boys always kept this plant full of flowers, which they changed from time to time; the head also had a support on both sides, where there were pots of young girl's hair ferns. The birds of love and the canaries hung in their golden houses in the windows, and they, poor things in cages, could jump as far from their wooden poles as Carol could venture out of his white bed. On one side of the room was a library filled with hundreds — yes, I mean — of hundreds of books; books with gay images, books without; books with black and white sketches, books without any; books with verses, books with stories; books that made the children laugh, and some, that made them cry; books with single syllable words for the little boys and girls, and books with scary words to puzzle the wise."
"They had already chosen the place for their nest, rising and descending in the twigs until they found a branch away from the sight of snakes and hawks and cruel tabby cats, high from the reach of the little naughty boys with their scarf strokes, and now everything was ready for these little carpenters to start their construction. No hammer and nails were necessary, claw and beak were all the tools they used, and yet what beautiful carpenter's work was to them! Do you see how strongly attached the nest is to these three thin twigs, and how carefully and closely it is woven, so that you can barely separate it? These hairy black hairs holding all the rest together were abandoned from the tail of Prince Charming (Prince Charming is the nice saddle horse that cultivates his grass, under the tree willow). These elegant brown hairs belonged to Lady Margery, the soft cow, who lives with her small calf Pet in the stable with Prince Charming; and there is a brilliant yellow spot on a side."
"At this moment, a large, comfortable white house, which had been previously hidden by large trees, came in sight. Timothy approached the fence of unmarked pickets, and looked at the beauties of the lateral courtyard and the front garden, - gazed and looked, and fell desperately into love at first sight. All the thing had been done as if to command; that's all there is to say about it. There was an orchard, and, oh, ecstasy! what crowds of green apples! There was an interesting grinding stone under a tree, and a bright blue chair and a stool under another; a sheath of currants and currants; and a flock of young turkeys ambushed badly through the barn. Timothy walked gently into the thick grass, passed a pump and a sparkling hollow, until a side porch came in sight, with a woman sitting there sewn rags of bright colors."
"It's a market night, and the streets will be a moving mass of men and women who buy in the stalls of the hucksters. Everything that can be sold in a display is there: fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, dishes, tin, children's clothes, cheap toys, boots, shoes, and sun caps, all in reckless confusion. The sellers shout their goods in stentorian tones, quarrel with each other to produce excitement and induce favouritism, while the jets of gas flow into the air from the roofs and fly off the sides of the stalls; the children cry, the children dance on the strains of an accordion, the children quarrel, the children scrambled for the fruit of waste. In the middle of this spectacle, this din and drugged, the women are fighting and negotiating quite calmly, looking at the scales to see that they get their full pennyworth or six pennyworth of this or that."
"And the river rolled towards the sea, singing its morning song, creating and nourishing beauty every step of its way forward. Sucked in the heart of a great mountain range, it continued its dazzling path, lying silently in glassy lakes, there rushing into small gleaming falls, smearing large falls, and trolling cataracts. Dozens of bridges spanned its width, but no ship entered its crystalline depths. Here and there, a small rough boat, tied to a willow, rocked up and down in a quiet bend of the shore. Here, the silver glow of a rising pole, a chub or a trout caught its eye; there, a picnic lay rigid in the clear water, a fish carved into stone: here eels wound in the muddy bottom of a pool; and there, under the deep shadow of the rocks, lay the fat, incredibly cold, and sore, in the wild."
"At Thanksgiving, one had seen her turquoise engagement ring, someone who said that such a hand was worthy of a diamond, that turquoise was a pretty color, but that there was only one stone for an engagement ring, and it was a diamond. At the same Christmas dance, it was said that she would have ""all the rage"" in Boston. She wondered if it was true, and she wondered whether, if she had not promised to marry Stephen, a splendid being of a city would have descended from her heights, carrying diamonds in her hand. Not that she would have accepted them; she wondered only."
"After a few small flight attempts, he extended his wings, rose from the earth, and after several times around his benefactor as to thank him, he flew to the mountain. Musai returned to his work, hoping that in season his work would yield a good harvest. His widowed mother had to support herself and needs work every day. His only pleasure was to return home, weary after the long hours of work in the muddy rice field, and to have a warm bath. His mother had always prepared for him. Then, clean and with a fresh kimono, and a little rest before supper, he was ready for a quiet evening with the neighbors."
"The Hare, one day, laughing at the Tortoise for his slowness and general recklessness, was challenged by the latter to run a race. The Hare, looking at the whole affair as a great joke, agreed, and the Fox was chosen to act as a referee and hold the stakes. The rivals began, and the Hare, of course, left her soon behind. By coming halfway to the goal, she began to play, snacking the young herbage, and had fun in many ways. The day being hot, she even thought that she would take a little nap in a shaded place, as if the Tortoise had to pass her while she was sleeping, she could easily overtake her before he reached the end. The Tortoise meanwhile bent, unshakeable and agitated, all the way to the goal. The Hare, having fallen asleep, began from her nap, and was surprised to discover that the Tortoise was not in sight."
"They sat along the edge of the lake, six girls and their two visitors. The water was a blue and still reflection of the sky with a deep shadow of the pine hill. Far from the hill and the lake stood the beech forest. In an open space on a small ascent of half of the ground inside, half without the forest, was the summer camp of the eagle Scouts. A small brown house built of logs was almost entirely covered with vines, a tangle of logger and goat and glyceria. Only windows and the door had the vines cut off. The house looked extremely old, older than the thin bees that formed a half circle on the back and left. Beyond the door, thick with deep green shade that morning, turned a single giant beech that seemed to have moved a few meters from its forest shelter to act as a sentinel for the log cabin."
"It was the first Saturday of the regular fall at Miss Allen's boarding school. The girls were back in their old places, except the senior of the previous year, who had graduated, and now the second were preparing for the first social event of the year, their reception to the newborns. Marjorie Wilkinson was president. The clock struck seven, and she stood perfectly in the center of the ground, looking at the result of their work. The naked and ugly gymnasium had disappeared; in its place was a small winter scene of the fairy country. The cedar branches, lined with artificial snowflakes, and large white snow benches, completely hid the view walls."
"Two weeks had passed since the graduation and our engine owners were barely beginning to feel the results of their hard winter work. It had been difficult to catch up with their classes after the return from Japan. There had been no homogeneity for them during the Christmas holidays, only continuous studies, and for weeks after, Billie and Nancy and Elinor were tutoring each afternoon. Mary Price, the best student of all three, had surpassed them, and finally took away the first honors and a scholarship from elsewhere. But after the excitement of the finals, the four friends had collapsed like pricked balloons. Billie, who died of what she considered to be a weakness of her character, could not throw a deep cold contracted in the spring. Mary Price was lame and white; Elinor had been mortally lean, and even Nancy had lost her roundness, and her face was generally palmated and pale. ""My child needs mountain air!"" said Mr. Campbell on one of her trips to West Haven. ""She must not have been in a hotel with her own friends."
"He thought that his happiness was complete when, as he walked without purpose, he was suddenly standing on the edge of a river full of food. Never in his life had he seen a river before — this sinuous, sinuous, full-bodied animal, hunting and grinning, clawing things with a sip and leaving them with a laugh, to throw himself on new playmates who shook, and were caught and held again. Everything was a-shake and a-winter—glients and glems and sparks, rust and whirlwind, chattering and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entered, fascinated. At the side of the river, he trotted like a trot, when very small, beside a man who holds a spell by exciting stories; and finally tired, he sat on the shore, while the river continued to chat about him, a procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told to the insatiable sea."
"The following afternoon, to the surprise of Primrose and Daisy, Noel arrived. Daisy greeted his prince with delight, but refused to hear the details of Dove's trial. ""I want to forget him,"" she said. ""You say he's in the dungeon now. I don't want to think about it. If I think about it for a long time, I'll start to be so sorry for him."" ""We'll talk about something better and more pleasant,"" she said. ""When will you come back to your palace Belle, little princess?"" Daisy looked anxiously through Primrose's room. Primrose leaned on a few needles, and a ray of sun shone on her beautiful head."
"Ms. Franklin earned the family bread by taking tenants. She was much more active than her husband, who had a very small clerk in the city; without her help, the children, Peter and Flossy, would hardly have been able to live, but by working from morning to night, saving every cent, turning and returning worn clothes, rubbing, cooking and brushing and cleaning, Ms. Franklin concluded for two ends. Her tenants said that the rooms they occupied were clean and neat, that their food was well cooked, and above all that the house was quiet."
"Priscilla was younger than her years, which were almost nineteen, but her face was older. It was an almost neat face, attentive, serious, with anxious lines already deepening the gravity of the mouth too serious. Priscilla cut a little bread and butter and poured tea for her aunt and for herself. Miss Rachel Peel was not the least like her niece. She was short and rather duvetous. She had a sensible face, straight, and she took life with a gravity that would have oppressed a less serious spirit than Priscilla's. ""Well, I'm tired,"" she said, ""when the meal was over. I guess I did much more than I thought I had all day. I think I'm going to go to bed early. We said all our last words, didn't we, Priscilla?"
"Squire O'Shanaghgan was a tall, powerful man, with deep eyes and strong, overhanging eyebrows; his hair was grey, very thick and abundant; he also had a sharp beard, and a long, overhanging mustache. He entered the northern living room even louder than Nora. Dogs sprang up with joy and threw themselves on him. ""Down, Creena! down, Cushla!"" he said. ""Ah, then, Nora, they are as bewitched as you, little woman. What beauties they grow up, to be sure!"" ""I raised them up, said Nora. I am proud of them both. One day I thought Creena could not live; but look at her now – her coat as black as the jet, and so silky."""
"She looked at a beautiful scene, made up of wood, river, meadows on a gentle slope and lawns. Right in front of her eyes was a paddock, and in the paddock the two foals who had just been sold were happy to graze. As Mrs. Lorrimer stood and looked outside, a girl was seen to enter the paddock and quickly go to the foals, calling their names as she did. They both came to her immediately. She threw an arm around the neck of one, while she was feeding them in turn with carrots and apples that she had in her apron. She was a girl slightly made, with dark hair and a face of tallow. Her hair was strongly hung on her shoulders. She could have been ten years old, but she looked younger. ""There is Nell,"" said the mother. ""I'm sorry that the foals are going, she's always made such animals. I never saw her take to creatures as they did everywhere, and they would follow her."
"Mr. Graham has always referred to his wife's dressing room as ""the citadel."" It was absolutely impregnable, he said. In the open field of the living room or the broken country of the dining room, it might be possible — he had never known such a thing to happen, but it might still be possible — for the commander-in-chief to support a defeat; but once penetrated behind the walls of the citadel, horse, foot, and dragons could attack her, but they could not gain an inch. Not an inch, sir! It is true that Mrs. Graham always felt the strongest in this particular room. She laughed at it, but she acknowledged the fact. Here, on the wall, hung a certain image that was always an inspiration for her. Here, on the shelf above her desk, were the books of her heart, the few tried friends to whom she turned for help and advice when things disturbed her."
"Miss Wealthy Bond was a very pretty old lady, and was very well aware of the fact, having said it for seventy years. ""The Lord made me pleasant to look at,"" she said, ""and it is a great privilege, my dear; but it is also a responsibility."" She had beautiful silver hair and soft blue eyes, and a complexion like that of a girl. Today, for the first time, she had put on her summer suit, a skirt and a jacket of limited white striped, open a little to the neck, with a handkerchief of soft white net on the inside. This handkerchief was attached with the prettiest brooch that had ever been, — a pansy, made of five deep and clear amethysts, put in a narrow rim of cast gold. Miss Wealthy always wore this pin; for in winter she was also in harmony with her dress of cashmere of lilac that in summer with the white dimity."
"The house was yellow, the white columns, and the joyous colors were triggered by the dark trees, the elms and the locusts, which leaned on it and almost hid it from the road. A smooth lawn length was between the house and the hedge, through which Hildegarde and the colonel had made their observations: a good lawn for tennis, Hildegarde thought. How good it would be to play tennis again! She was so eager for the time when Hugh would be big enough to learn, or when Jack Ferrers, his cousin, would come back from Germany. What a surprise for Jack when she wrote to him that the yellow house was inhabited. What friends he could make of these two beautiful boys, unless he took one of his timid fit, and would have nothing to do with them. Jack was a trying boy, though very expensive."
"After having lost the path several times only to stumble into the cave, and then slide, slide, or sink into the steep slope of the mountain where the wooden line ended near the cliff, Eleanor finally recognized the ravine where the cave was located. ""Oh, thank God! We're almost there,"" she cried, trying to find the easiest way to get down to the cornice. Polly and Anne were sitting before the entrance to the cave, when they heard screams and saw three tired runners coming along the rocky cornice that led to their refuge. ""Why – it's Nolla and Bob and a man!"" cried Polly, rushing to run and meet the girls. ""What's wrong, someone hurt?"" cried Anne, when she saw the faces of the girls. Eleanor then told the forest fire, and where the men were."
"Polly was a true child of nature. His life of just over fourteen years had been spent in the mountains surrounding his ranch-home, Pebbly Pit. The farm was strangely located in the crater of an extinct volcano, known on the maps as ""The Devil's Tomb."" Like many other peaks scattered in this area of Colorado, volcanic fires had been dead for centuries. The outer edge of the crater formed a natural wall around the bowl, and protected the rich and fertile soil of the farm from the desert winds that covered other ranches with its fine alkaline dust. Winter snows, housed in the crevices of cliffs, slowly melted during the summer progress, providing sufficient moisture for vegetation growing in the ""bowl""; and this provided a magnificent pasture for herds of cattle belonging to the rancher."
"Immediately after the captain's screams, a large hulk landed right next to the yacht, and a terrible blow to the back of the pleasure craft sent her to fly diagonally through the water. The collision caused her nose to sink dangerously while the stern was rising away from the waves. The group sitting forward slipped together, and some were thrown out of their chairs, but managed to catch the ropes and the rail to prevent them from being thrown overboard. Polly and Tom, standing, ignorant, so close to the gap opened in the rail, still arm in arm they had walked, were thrown violently laterally and there was nothing at hand to hold, or to prevent their passage over the side, they fell into the dark sea."
"The two young cruisers of the motorboat could not say a single word when these amazing words came to their ears. Meanwhile, the other boat approached quickly, and Jack could even say that the men crowded in it seemed to be kind of a uniform, because he certainly discovered brass buttons. So it was not a joke, nor a sort of trick played by cunning river vagrants to catch the boys from their guard. Jimmie rubbed his eyes, and murmured to himself, as if he were beginning to believe that he could dream. ""Don't think of offering any resistance, you blushing!"" continued the voice of the claw in the nearby boat; ""because we are ready to give you a volleyball."
"A dog of Flanders — yellow of skin, great of head and limb, with ears similar to wolves that were erect, and legs bent and feet enlarged in the muscular development of his race by many generations of hard service. Patrasche came from a race that had worked hard and cruelly from sire to son in Flanders a century—slaves, dogs of the people, beasts of wells and harnesses, creatures who experienced the pressure of their nerves in the gall of the cart, and died breaking their heart on the flints of the streets. Patrasche was born of parents who had worked hard all their time on the sharp stones of the various cities and long roads, without shadow, weary of the two Flanders and Brabant. He was born to no inheritance other than those of pain and labour. He had been fed curses and baptized with blows. Why not?"
"In August, the son of a baker of salt and a little cowman, when he was no matter what, dreamed of dreams, and when he was on the high plateaus with his cattle, with the silence and the sky around him, he was quite certain that he would live for greater things than driving the herds when spring came in the middle of the blue sea of gentians, or lingering in the city with wood and wood as his father and grandfather did every day of their lives. He was a strong and healthy little boy, nourished with the open air of the mountain, and he was very happy, and loved his devoted family, and was as active as the squirrel and as playful as a hare; but he kept his thoughts for himself, and some of them went far for a little boy who was only one among many, and to whom no one had ever paid attention, except to teach him his letters and tell him to fear God."
"It was a pretty little cabin, pink like a seashell, in the way the Netherlanders love; and its two small square trellis were dark with creeping plants and large roses, and its roof, so low that you could touch it, was golden and green with all the lichens and stones that are known on earth. Here Baby grew year after year; and soon learned to be large and robust enough to tie clusters of stocks and roses for the market, and then to wear a basket for herself, trotting through Antoine's side along the green road and in the white and broad streets; and in the market the buyers, most often when they were young mothers, would look for the little golden head and the beautiful frank blue eyes, and would buy the lilies and carnations of Babye, whether they wanted them or not."
"If a clock with a great lack of tact had not insisted on telling them that he was late, Kitty would never have returned home, because the two young people felt inclined to stroll with their arms on the sweet summer night forever. Jack had wanted to say something before she left, and was extremely surprised to find the lost chance for the moment. He wanted to go home with him and free his mind; but an old neighbor man having been hired as an escort, there would have been very little satisfaction in a trip trio; so he gave up. He was very quiet while they were walking at the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kitty thought he was tired, perhaps happy to be rid of her, and humbly accepted her fate. But at the moment the train approached, she gave impulsive pressure, and said very kindly: ""Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your stupid little cousin; but I will never forget it, and if I can ever return it with all my heart."""
"Marjorie was rather afraid of the big pony, who threw her head at her, whipped her tail, and patted her feet as if he had a peppery character. But she liked to be useful, and she felt just as little as she could not do if she tried, because it was her birthday. So, proudly, she let down the reins, and when Jack went to the creek, she was standing on the bridge waiting to check him after he had drunk his water clear and fresh. The old gentleman sat down in his place, looking at the little girl, who smiled at herself by looking at the blue dragon flies dancing among the ferns, a black bird bowing over the alders, and listening to the babble of the creek. ""How old are you, my child?"" asked the old man, as if he were rather envious of this dewled creature his youth and his health. ""Two today, sir;"" and Marjorie rose up right and high, as though conscious."
"A child's voice sang, a child's hand carried the little candle; and in the circle of the sweet light that she poured, Effie saw a beautiful child coming to her through the night and the snow. A dewling creature, smiling, wrapped in white fur, with a crown of green and scarlet on her shiny hair, the magic candle in one hand, and the other stretched out as if to shower gifts and warmly squeeze all the other hands. Effie forgot to speak as this brilliant vision approached, leaving no trace of step in the snow, leaving only light on the way with her little candle, and filling the air with the music of her song."
"""Last night it was a very long day,"" Vrouw Vedder said in the morning after Market Day. ""You were gone so long."" Kat gave her mother a big hug. ""We'll stay with you all day today, Mother,"" she said. ""Isn't that right, Kit?"" ""Yes,"" Kit said; and he also tightened her. ""And we'll help you just as much as we helped Father yesterday. Isn't that right, Kit?"" ""More,"" Kit said. ""I shouldn't ask myself!"" said Father. ""I'll be happy with the help,"" Vrouw Vedder said, ""because Grandma comes, and I want everything to be very clean and tidy when she comes. I go to the pasture to let the cow. You can go with me and keep the flies away. It will be a great help."" Vrouw Vedder put a yoke on his shoulders, with hooks suspended from each end."
"Mademoiselle laughed. ""Long live France,"" she replied, ""and then, turning to the truck, she cried, ""Come and see what we have in our small shop on wheels. But first let me introduce you to Dr. Miller. He was an American doctor who came to look after all those who might be ill."" The doctor had already climbed from his seat high and opened the back of the truck. She smiled and shook hands with the people. ""Is there not something you wanted to buy here?"" she asked. ""The prices are clearly marked."" Everyone now cut around the truck, and there,—Oh, wonderful,—stacked on the floor and hung on the top and sides, were the very things they so much wanted to knit! There were hooves, shoves, rakes and garden seeds of all kinds. There were bolts of cloth and wool clothes and wooden shoes, and yarns to knit."
"There was only porridge and milk for breakfast, so it took only a short time to eat it, and the real work of the day began. The shepherd put his hood Kilmarnock and called Tam, who had had breakfast on the fireplace, and the two went to the hills after the sheep. Jock led the cow to a plot of green grass near the bottom of the hill, where she could find fresh pastures, and John was left alone in the kitchen of the little grey house. Ah, you should have seen her then! She washed the dishes and put them in the closet, wrote the milk and put the cream in the oyster, swept the fireplace and shook the blankets in the fresh air in the morning."
"A long finger of sun flowed through the western window and touched the large stone stove, as if he were trying to wake up the fire inside. A beam fell on a pot of water standing on the ground and sent bursts of gay light dancing on the bright boxes in the cabinet. The cuckoo saw all at a glance. ""It will never happen,"" he said indignantly. There was a noise more than roaring in his interior as if his feelings were too far away for him, and then suddenly he sent a loud ""cuckoo"" that sounded through the silent room. Immediately, the little grey mouse jumped from the table and fled to his hole in the wall, the golden sun fled and fled, and the shadows began to slip into the corners. ""Cuckoo, couckoo,"" he shouted at the top of his voice, ""Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo"", six times behind him, and he fled again."
"For a few moments, the terrified occupants of the Avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred. The innocent plot that Anne had apparently supposed to contain Mrs. Hiram's nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinion wheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by the father of Sainte-Claire Donnell the day before, with the intention of having a birthday party that night. The crackers departed from a thunderstorm of noise and the pinion wheels burst fervently around the room, whistling and bursting. Anne threw herself into her white chair with consternation and all the girls climbed on their desks. Joe Sloane stood like a transfixed in the middle of the commotion and Sainte-Claire, without help of laughter, lurking in the driveway. Prillie Rogerson evaporated himself and Annetta Bell in hysterical."
"Physically, the two men did not look like one another, although they were secondary cousins. Eric Marshall, tall, broad, shouldered, walking with a free, easy walk, which was somewhat suggestive of reserve strength and power, was one of those men about whom the least favored mortals are seriously tempted to wonder why all the gifts of fortune should be sprayed upon an individual. He was not only intelligent and good to look at, but he possessed this unfailing personality charm that is quite independent of physical beauty or mental ability. He had greyish blue eyes, dark brown hair with a glimmer of gold in his waves when the sunlight struck him, and a chin that gave the assurance of the world of a chin. He was a rich son of man, with a pure young man behind him and splendid perspectives before him. He was considered as a kind of practical companion, totally without guilt of dreams and romantic visions of any kind."
"We were quite willing to go to bed; and we were currently piled up on the floor even in the room, looking eastward in the spruce grove, which the father had occupied. Dan shared it, sleeping in a bed of his own in the opposite corner. The sheets and pads were scented with lavender, and one of Grand-Mère King's noted patches was on us. The window was open and we heard the frogs sing in the marsh of the creek meadow. We had heard frogs sing in Ontario, of course; but certainly the frogs of Prince Edward Island were calmer and mellow. Or was it simply the glamorous old traditions and family tales that were on us, lending his magic to all the looks and sounds around us? It was the father's house, our house!"
"The old lady lived ""at the back of Old Lloyd"", as she was always called. It was a picturesque, low house, with large chimneys and square windows and with spruces growing all around. The old lady lived there alone and there were weeks at a time when she never saw a human being except Crooked Jack. What the old lady did with herself and how she put in her time was a puzzle that the Spencer people could not solve. The children believed she was having fun counting gold in the big black box under her bed. Spenceral children held the old lady in mortal terror; some of them — the ""park road"" fry — believed she was a witch; they all ran if, wandering in the woods in search of berries or spruce gum, they saw remotely the shape of the old lady, collecting sticks for her fire. Mary Moore was the only one who was quite sure that she was not a witch."
"Fatima arrived the next day. Max took her into a covered basket, lined with padded crimson satin. Max loves cats and aunt Cynthia. He explained to me how we were treating Fatima and when Ismay came out of the room — Ismay was always out of the room when she knew I wanted her to stay especially — he offered me again. Of course, I didn't say, as usual, but I was rather happy. Max offered me about every two months for two years. Sometimes, as in this case, he went three months, and I always wondered why. I concluded that he couldn't really care about Anne Shirley, and I was relieved. I didn't want to marry Max but it was nice and convenient to have him around him, and we would miss him terribly if another girl had hit him."
"It was a very hot day near the end of June, and the young lady had chosen the coolest and most shadiest place that she could find on the piazza of her father's elegant home in Belfast. She was as pretty as she was bright and alive, and was a general favourite among the high school students she attended. She was deeply absorbed by the reading of a story in one of the July magazines, which had just come from the post office, when she heard a step near her. The noise was so close, she was so close; and, looking up, she discovered the young man she had spoken to close next to her. It was not Don John of Austria, but Donald John Ramsay of Belfast, who had been addressed by her companions just like Don, natural abbreviation of her first name, until it was mentioned in the story at school, when the whole class looked at Don, and got a check, and some girls even got a check; and some girls got a check; and some of them got a check; and some of them got a check."
"Paul Vapoor was a genius, and this represented his position as chief engineer at the age of twenty-two. He was born a machinist, and his taste in this direction had made him a very hard student. His days and much of his nights, while he was a teenager, had been devoted to studying physics, chemistry, and, in fact, all the sciences that had any impact on the work of life than nature rather than the choice had given him to do. His father had been in difficult circumstances before, so that he had had nothing to interfere with his studies before he was old. Until that time, he had spent a lot of his time in a large machine shop, working for nothing as if his daily bread depended on his efforts; and he was better qualified to lead a motor than most of the men who had served for years in the business, for he was a natural scientist."
"The captain's cabin was in the stern of the ship, according to the orthodox rule in the navy's ships. Of course, it was small, although it seemed large for Christy who had spent so much free time in the cabin of Florence, his sailboat on the Hudson. It was considerably arranged, with little superfluous ornamentation; but it was a complete living room, as a peasant looked at it. From there, on the port side, the captain's stateroom, which was large enough for a ship not larger than the Bronx, was opened. Between it and the warden on the starboard side, was an alley leading from the foot of the accompanying road, through which the master's cabin and the guard room were accessible from the deck of the watch. Crossing the bridge at the foot of the steps, Christy led the way in the state room, where the chief officers were housed."
"When Florence's cook, usually the captain of the boat, took care of the practice of culinary art, he sat down on what looked like a box in front of the stove. But the inside of this box was really part of the cabin, because it contained the feet of anyone occupying the berth on the starboard side. The kitchen room did not have a tip of bins, lockers and drawers to contain the variety of provisions and provisions necessary to get up a dinner for the skipper and his guests, when he had them. And even those places could not contain all that was necessary on board. Under the two berths were large, but not very deep, lockers, one of which contained the jib-topsail of the boat, and other emergency sails, while the other was the fuel locker of the sloop. Since the boat had not been used for a long time in the cruise, the fuel receptacle was empty, although a spare gaff-topsai had been thrown there."
"When the execution was finished, Noddy, with the help of one of his companions, dressed in ""trank and tights"", and appeared in the ring to take his first lesson in graceful movements. He could turn the bandits, and pass with the other evolutions; but he needed a certain polish — so the master of the ring said — to make them pass well. He had to take a graceful position at the beginning and at the end of each act; he had to recover without malfeasance; he had to bow and make bloom with his hands, when he had done a brilliant thing. Noddy did not have much taste for this branch of the profession. He did not like inclination and development. If the exploit himself did not please the people, he could not win them by scrutinizing. He was very happy with his costume, and that kept him good-nature, under the severe formation of the master of the ring, for a time. Mr. Whippleby was rude and hard in his ways."
"There was an old man who lived at that time, who frequented fairs that were held through the mountains; and one day he passed through the mountains to a fair, and when he came to a lonely valley, he sat down, for he was tired, and fell asleep, and his sack fell by his side. When he slept, the fairies came and carried him, bag and all, and took him under the ground, and when he awoke, he was in a great golden palace, full of fairies who danced and sang. And they took him and showed him everything, the splendid golden chamber and the gardens, and they continued to dance around him until he fell asleep."
"The truth is that Svadilfare was tired of working day and night. When he saw the little mare go galloping out he suddenly became unhappy. He left the stone that he was carrying on the ground. He looked around him and saw the little mare look back. He galloped after her. He did not catch up with the little mare. She continued quickly in front of him. On she went over the lunar meadow, turning and looking back from time to time and times at the great Svadilfare, which came heavily after her. At the bottom of the mountain the mare went, and Svadilfare, who now rejoiced in her freedom and in the freshness of the wind and in the smell of the flowers, always following her. With the morning light they came near a cave and the little mare entered into her. They went through the cave. Then Svadilfare took on the little mare and both went wandering together, the little mare telling Svadilfare the stories."
"Roy Blakeley collected the ballots in his two hands, put them in the shoe box and pushed the box through the table to Mr. Ellsworth as if the matter were finally settled.""The Honourable Roy Blakeley, he added, was not even wearing his own patrol.""This humiliating confession, offered in Roy's most gay way, was true. The Foxes of Money had turned away from their leader and, towards a scout, voted for Tom Slade. It was suggested that Roy himself was responsible for this matter, but that he was a good politician and would not speak. There was also a dark rumor that a certain young lady was involved in the case and it was a fact that only the night before Roy and Mary Temple had been seen in serious conversation on the large veranda of Grantley Square by Pee-wee Harris, who believed that a scout should be observed."
"Tommy Atkins' rifle was by no means the first thing inanimate to prove the human being and deserve human treatment. Animals of all kinds have been given this quality. Jack London's dog, in The Wild's Call, has a human interest. Thus has immortal black beauty. But we are not concerned with animals now. Kipling's ship has a human interest — a soul. I don't need to tell you that a boat is human. Its all erratic quality of vivacity, its true heroism under stress, its temperament (if you like that word) makes it very human. That's why a man will often let his boat rot rather than sell it."
"The seeds he had planted had not been raised, because he had buried them instead of planting them. Roy's onion plants penetrated into the patriotic garden of the troupe; Doc Carson's lettuce showed the appropriate spirit; a small regiment of humble radishes mobilized under the affectionate care of Connie Bennett, and Pee-wee's tomatoes were bold with flourishing flowers. A bashful cucumber that shrouded quietly in the humidity of the glaciery under the hangar of Artie Van Arlen's house was rapidly developing. But there was nothing else but beans, peas or Tom's beets — nothing in his small allocated plot but a solitary plantain whom he had carefully nourished until Pee-wee told him the bitter truth — that this child of his heart was nothing but a weed."
"As long as there are traces of a trail, you can't make me spit, but crack, I don't like the marshes. You can get lost in a marsh more easily than in any other place. Not long I was bending deeper than my knees and it gave me a tension every time I dragged my leg out of the marsh. Maybe you wonder why I didn't go back, but if you do, it's because you don't know much about the marshes. All of a sudden I was right in the middle, as you might say, and there was no landmark at all. Very quickly I was in the deep waist and then I was afraid, you can bet."
"But remember, I told you that the hike didn't really start before arriving at Catskill. The reason I don't count on hiking from Temple Camp to Catskill is because we were hiking all the time there. It wasn't a hike, it was a habit. I wouldn't be particular about three or four miles. In addition, I wouldn't ask you to take them, because they were used before. I wouldn't give you a second hand miles. When we arrived at Catskill, we bought egg powder and bacon (gee, I like bacon) and coffee and sugar and camera movies and mosquito dope, beans and flour and chocolate."
"Tom Slade, leaning on the table of the office, searched the great map of the Temple camp. It was the first time that he really looked at it since he returned from France, and it made him see, even in its cold contours, the familiar things and scenes that he had loved so much as a scout. The hill path was nothing but a dotted line, but Tom knew it more than that, because it was along his winding path in the dark corners of the mountains which he had qualified for the pathfinder's badge. Black Lake was only an irregular circle, but in the eye of his mind he saw the moon's light scintillating the water, and the canoes shone silently, and heard the joyful voices of the Scouts diving from the springboard to his edges. He liked this map better than cards of billets and trenches, and for him the hill path was more suggestive of adventure than the Hindenburg line."
"It is not that he loved Scouts less, but rather that he loved the woods more. It is his desire to walk when his camp duties for the day were finished and to walk around in the adjacent woods. Scouts knew and respected his peculiarities and preferences, especially those who were regular summer visitors in the great camp, and few followed him in his chosen haunts. Sometimes, a new Scout, tempted by the invading reputation and the unique neglect of Uncle Jeb's young assistant, ventured to follow him and use the advice and wood lure with which the more experienced Scouts abounded when he was in the mood to speak. But Tom was a sort of separate creature and the boys in the camp, good scouts they were, did not interfere with his solitary Scouts."
"Some of the most adventurous and reckless made birch ornaments, while those who were in total despair of something to do wrote letters to the house. Several unmistakable spirits braided the rain to catch a fish, but the fish, themselves disgusted, remained at the bottom of the lake, out of the wet, as Roy said. It was so wet that even the turtles would not come out without umbrellas. Rain, rain, rain. He sunk from the roof of the pavilion like a waterfall. He narrowed the tent cloth that was pulling on the ropes and lifting the ankles of the bloodied ground. He buried the roads in the mud."
"Pee-wee and Pepsy didn't agree to allow this third person to buy in their business. Pepsy was suspicious because she couldn't understand it. But Pee-wee, quick to forget the aversions and trifling wounds, was strong for the new partner.""He's good,"" he said, ""and the scouts are supposed to be nice and help people and maybe he wants to reform and we should help him get into business."" ""He's smart and I hate him and three is bad luck,"" was all Pepsy could say. Then she broke herself crying, ""Miss Bellison also hates him,"" she said, ""and if people sit in a wagon three times, one of them dies in less than a year."
"The night was dark and cold. Throughout the melancholy, day of joy, the first thrill of autumn had been in the air. By evening the clouds had separated, showing a steel-coloured sky in which the sun descended a large red ball, tinting the foliage through the river with a glow of crimson. A sun full of rich light but no heat. The air was heavy with the scent of burning leaves. The gutters along the main street were full of these red monuments fluttering from the good summer era. But there were other signs that the days of melancholy had come."
"A large, long, grey shape moved quickly into the waters of the Thames. The smoke, pouring from three different points in the middle of this great shape, ascended straight into the air, then, caught by the wind, drifted westward. It darkened. Several hours before, this lizard of the ocean, one of the monsters of Great Britain, had straightened himself and had left his dock, where he had undergone slight repairs, towards the east down the river. Men bordered the tracks of the monster ship. These were his crews, or some of his crews, to be exact, because the others took care of tasks that prevented them from turning towards the crowds that searched the shore, like the men on the deck. Sharp's orders carried the water to the ears of those who were on the shore."
"The U.S.S. Plymouth was Jack Templeton's first command. He had been raised to the rank of captain a few weeks before. Naturally, he was not a little proud of his ship. When Jack was given to his ship, he was only natural, too, that Frank Chadwick, who had been his partner and chum through every day of the Great War, should become Jack's first officer. Despite the fact that Jack's qualification as a captain was in the British Navy, he was at that time in command of an American ship. This came through a combination of queer circumstances. The American commander of the Plymouth had suddenly been taken ill. Almost at the same time, the Plymouth had been ordered to move from Dover to Liverpool to join other American ships. Almost the day before the departure, the first officer was also taken ill. It was to him that the command would naturally fall in absence of the captain. The second officer was on leave. Thus, without skipper, the Plymouth could not embark."
"It was already the light of the candles when we arrived in the hamlet, and I will never forget how much I was encouraged to see the yellow shine in the doors and windows; but, as he proved, it was the best of the help we could get in this neighborhood. For, you thought that the men would have been ashamed of themselves, no soul would consent to come back with us to Admiral Benbow. The more we talked about our troubles, the more the man, the woman and the child, they hung on to the shelter of their houses. Captain Flint's name, although it was strange to me, was quite known to some there and carried a great weight of terror."
"The sky was all blue; the wind was strong and stable; the sails of the windmill turned; and the willows over all the fen were torn and whitened like a corn field. He had spent all night in the saddle, but his heart was good and his body sounded, and he was driving straight into the marsh. The path went down and down until he lost sight of all the nearby landmarks, but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him, and the extreme top of the Tunstall forest long before. On either hand there were great fields of breaths and willows, pools of water trembling in the wind, and treacherous peatlands, as green as emerald, to tempt and betray the traveller. The path was almost straight through the morass."
"One of the first adventures in the field of the manufacture of useful necessities was the construction of a water wheel; the construction of a sawmill, from which the wood turned out to be their home; a trade allowed them to weave clothes; and finally, a wagon, which rose from the desire to use a herd of yaks, which they managed to capture. Before the present adventure, a number of useful articles and tools had been made, including a tower, a foundry, in which they shot iron and brass articles, and this gave them the opportunity to first make some pistols, and finally several cannons, with which the present expedition was equipped."
"Their journey was accompanied by favorable winds and perfect weather. Valparaiso, Chile, was the first port where they landed, and as a voyage around the Horn, or even through the Strait of Magellan, and along the Atlantic coast, would mean several months, with their own ship, they shipped in one of the line vapors, and within seven weeks they saw Sandy Hook lightship, and then the forts that bordered the bank opposite to the Narrows. The telegrams to their parents created paroxysms of joy in many houses that had been stolen when the investigator came down. There were no happier houses than those that Harry and George were greeted. The newspapers told the stories of the boys in pages and descriptions, and they showed the pictures, and told what the boys had done in their temporary home. The hero of all this wonderful return was Angel."
"Her aunt Rachel had another reason to wish her to leave Waverley-Honour. She had indeed observed her look Edward too often through the bench of the Squire in the church! Now Aunt Rachel was not wrong to look at the bench of Squire Stubbs if only this bench had been empty. But it was (oh, the wickedness!) just when it contained the dear old dress and the nice fresh face of Miss Cecilia Stubbs, that Aunt Rachel's nephew looked most often in that direction. In addition to which the old lady was sure that she had observed ""this little Celie Stubbs"" looking at her beautiful Edward in a way that — well, when she was young! And here the old lady bridles and throws her head, and the words that her lips formed to pronounce (although she was too lady to speak them) were obviously ""The Minx!"" So it was clear for the simplest and unprejudiced that a greater distance should be placed between Waverley's loft and Squire as possible."
"The Crawfurds had a cousin who visited them, an English cousin, Polly Musgrave, from the luxury and gaiety compared to her rich aunt without a child in York. Polly was a well-bred orphan, had no close family ties, and had been educated in the worldly wisdom and epicurean philosophy of a fashionable girls' school. She had come to spend a few weeks, and to meet her Scottish cousins. Polly had not found her heart, but it was to the credit of her sense and good nature that she had made the best of a stay that had threatened to be a boredom for her. She dazzled the girls, cheated on the boys, entered with the greatest joy into rural occupations, fell on the roughest pony, saw Barnbougle's sunset and sunrise, and threatened to learn to launder cows and cut corn."
"The Millars were still in the old quaintly spacious house with its large arch garden, for the plausible reason that Dr. Millar could not, on the impulse of the moment, find a buyer or a tenant available. He took some credit to himself for having more scope of sight and control of the common sense than poor Mrs. Carey, otherwise he could have rushed and numbed his family into a small uncomfortable house, for which, at the same time, he should have paid the rent, which was not requested, unless in the form of tariffs and taxes, where her old house was concerned. There might be something to say on the other side of the question, but still that had not happened to Dr. and Mrs. Millar. However, the doctor's brougham, like the Rector's phaeton, was a thing of the past."
"Alice was the youngest of the Parlin family. When Grandma Read called the children in the kitchen, and told them about their new little sister, Susy danced with joy; and Prudy, in her delight, opened the door of the cellar, and fell on the whole length of the stairs. However, she rolled as gently as a pincushion, and was not seriously injured. ""But you can't go into the mother's room,"" said Susy, ""you cry so loud."" ""Poh!"" replied Prudy, three-year-old, twinkles tears; ""Yes, I can't either."
"I don't know who felt the most at home in these woods, birds or children. It was not at all like having a party in a living room, where there are chairs and carpets in the way; and where you can't run and jump without fear of hurting something. No, there was no danger of scratching the varnish of trees, nor of defiling the soft carpet of the earth. And if there had not been a party, it was enough to make a body happy only to breathe the soft air, and look away from the white village, and away from the blue hills. Ruth daughter of Dr. Gray, a fourteen-year-old girl, had to have the care of Prudy; and first she followed the child as her shadow."
"A beautiful morning in October, the sun rose and rejoiced. Dotty Dimple looked at him from the window with feelings of particular pleasure. ""I should think that the old sun would wear and grow hard around the edges. Why not? Last week, he was never so dull; now he is brilliant. I shouldn't wonder if the angels up there should scare him once in a while."" You perceive that Dotty's ideas of astronomy were anything but correct. She assumed that solar gold was composed of a very particular kind of gold, which could be rubbed as easily as Norah's boxes, although so intensely hot that the fingers would, very likely, be burned in the operation. This particular morning, she felt an unusual interest in the state of time. It had been decided that she had to go west with her father, and it was the day set for departure. ""I am happy to my throat,"" she said to Prudy."
"It was a beautiful place to play. There were trees to hide, flat places for croquets, and small hills and hollows for everything else. The children of the village used this for a kind of park, and the river seemed to look and laugh at seeing them so gay. It was a very sober river, stable above and below, but here, she would hop and stumble on a few rocks, making a happy waterfall, – just to have fun, you would think. The children liked to jump stones and see them turn in the foam; but they had been warned not to go too close to the shore. No one had ever fallen in, but it was not a safe place for very small people, certainly not for ros-poly babies like Bubby Proudfit. He was very clumsy, falling, rolling, and rising up every five minutes. Patty wanted to look at him, but he was not very interesting, and the little girls very bewitched with their beautiful smiles and pretty manners."
"Two hundred and thirty-nine voices of girls sang the Wo-he-lo Cheer with a strange impression. The scene alone would have been quite impressive, but Camp Fire Girls are not satisfied with this kind of ""fair enough."" Once their imagination stimulated by the almost unlimited possibilities of crafting, they are not easily satisfied with anything but a finished product. The occasion was the last fire of the Grand Council of Hiawatha Institute for Camp Fire Girls located in the city of Allegheny of Westmoreland. The class work had been rushed one day before, the exams were almost perfunctory, and for them also the clock was shot twenty-four hours before. The program was completed, and the day just closed was dedicated to preparing a great board for the fifteen lights of the Institute, which would ""break the ranks"" the next day and scatter in all directions for the house and Christmas parties."
"A little knot of schoolgirls came back together one afternoon in July. As they approached Dr. Carr's door, Maria Fiske cried out, seeing a nice bouquet of flowers in the middle of the sidewalk: ""Oh my!"" she exclaimed, ""See what someone has let go! I will have it."" She bowed to pick it up. But just as her fingers touched the stems, the nosegay, as if he were bewitched, began to move. Maria made a stunned clutch. The nasgay moved faster, and finally disappeared under the door, while a laugh sounded on the other side of the hedge."
"The Ulster and the felt hat soon went away, for a headwind stopped waiting, and the ""Spartacus"" began to throw and throw in a way that made all its passengers without season happy to go to their berths. Mrs. Ashe and Amy were among the first victims of sea sickness; and Katy, after helping them to settle in their state chamber, found themselves too dizzy and ill to sit down for a longer time, and fortunately resorted to herself. The night having come, the wind strengthened and the movement worsened. The ""Spartacus"" had the reputation of being a terrible ""roll"" and seemed to have to justify it on this particular journey."
"Burnet's trip to Hillsover was very long. It took most of three days, and as Dr. Carr was in a hurry to return to his patients, they traveled without stopping; spend the first night on the boat, and the second on a railway train. Dad found it tiring; but the girls, who were all new, found him pleasant. They enjoyed their state room, with its narrow shelves of beds, as much as if it were a baby's house, and they two children played in it. Throwing themselves for the night in a car section seemed the most fun in the world. When the elderly struck, they laughed. Everything was interesting, from telegraphic poles on the side of the road to the faces of their fellow passengers. He had fun watching people, and inventing stories about them, where they were going, and what relationship they could be with each other."
"They were at the entrance of a deep defilement, that the road hurts and hurts itself, following the links of the river, which they cross and cross several times. A wonderful and perfect little river, with clear water as air and cold as ice, flowing on a bed of smooth granite, gliding here without noise on long slopes of rock like thin films of glass, deepening in pools of translucent blue-green as aqua-marine or beryl, diving again in mimic cascades, a leaf of iridescent foam. The noise of its rush and its undulation was like a laugh. Never the water so happy, thought Clover, as she bent and curved and swinged as well as on her downward trajectory as if she was moved by a joyful and capricious instinct, like a child's dance."
"Groton Bay, as any geography student knows, is an almost enclaved, sheltered body of water, about seven miles long and three miles wide. At the mouth of the Groton River stands Colfax, a city of more than thirty thousand inhabitants. That was almost all that the submarines knew of their destination, until they arrived in the bay the afternoon after they left, Dunhaven. Their descent had continued. Jack had had Biffens to relieve him by the wheel, while Mr. Farnum had helped Hal in the engine room. Moreover, Lieutenant Danvers had held a few laps at the wheel. While Jack had come into the ""Benson"", who was carrying the two remaining loaded torpedoes, Eph had handled the ""Hastings"" with Ewald as a relief. Williamson had manipulated the engines of the latter vessel. David Pollard had left the emergency machinery room standing."
"Then the young girl went to the ground, and when she heard that the Baba Yaga was hunting her, and that she was now near, she threw the towel. And she became a wide and wide river. The Baba Yaga went up to the river, and grinned her teeth with spite; and then she came home for her oxen, and brought them to the river. The oxen drank every drop of the river, and then the Baba Yaga began to chase again. But the young girl gave her ear to the ground, and when she heard that the Baba Yaga was near, she went down the comb, and immediately a forest was inflamed, so thick that she returned."
"The class had met again in Professor Gray's study and all were eager to hear the second speech about Edison. There was a delay of several minutes after the hour said, but the anticipation was such that the time was barely noticed. During the acting, Professor Gray came to the place where Bill and Gus were sitting. ""I hear you intend to go to work in the mills next week,"" he said. ""Well, now I have some news and a proposal, so don't be disappointed if the beginning seems to be discouraging."
"Harry, who was among the ruins of the desert camp, had discovered several cans of gasoline that the raiders had neglected. They formed enough fuel with the picrick cakes that Frank still had a supply, to drive the big plane for several hundred miles if the conditions of the wind were favorable. But leaving the river camp the boys did not dare, because they found that if Billy and Lathrop managed to escape, they would return there, if possible. Certainly, it was such a distant chance that it seemed almost impossible, but in the circumstances even the shadow of hope seemed to take substance. And they waited, and waited, while the moving events that we had told had occurred to their missing hums. As to add to their oppression, the former Sikaso was luning on the camp, his eyes rooted in the ground in mood absorption and whispering to himself, ""five go — three came back,"" until Frank ordered him to stop."
"There was a telephone system connecting Bud's camp with his father's main ranch and also the two branches, and the system was also connected with the long distance. But a recent wind, just before the round-up, had blown up some poles in Happy Valley, putting Bud's line out of commission. That's why he and his poles could not be reached by Diamond X's wire. The poles were put in place in the following days, when some cowboys arrived to resume their duties with Bud, Nort and Dick; because the unsold cattle were again sent back to the valley range to fatten for the fall, and they had to be treated. Meanwhile, a search of the surrounding country had failed to reveal any trace of the thieves, and their identity remained hidden. They had left with about $500, missing a much larger sum in the safe."
"In ancient times, when the world was young, there were no automobiles or flying machines to make a wonder; there were no trains, no telephones, no mechanical inventions to keep people at a high level of excitement. Men and women lived simply and quietly. They were the children of nature, and breathed fresh air in their lungs instead of smoke and coal gas; and they walked through the green meadows and deep forests instead of riding in street cars; and they slept when it was dark and rising with the sun - which is very different from the current custom."
"Mombi's curious magic often scared her neighbors, and they treated her timidly, but respectfully, because of her strange powers. But Tip hated her frankly, and did not bother to hide her feelings. Indeed, he sometimes showed less respect for the old woman than he should have done, considering that she was her guardian. There were pumpkins in Mombi's corn fields, lying red in gold among the rows of green stems; and these had been planted and carefully cared that the four-horned cow could eat it during the winter. But one day, after the corn had been cut and stacked, and Tip carried the pumpkins to the stable, he took a notion to make a ""Jack Lantern"" and try to scare the old woman."
"There was an apple tree next to the house, and a few apples had fallen to the ground. The shamgy man thought they would taste better than the oats, so he walked to get it. A small black dog with bright brown eyes came out of the farm and ran furiously towards the shamgy man, who had already picked up three apples and put them in one of the large pockets of his shamgy coat. The little dog barked and dived for the leg of the shamgy man; but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in his big pocket with the apples. He then took more apples, for many were on the ground; and each one of those he threw in his pocket hit the little dog somewhere on the head or on the back, and pushed it. The little dog was called Toto, and he was sorry that he was put in the pocket of the shamgy man."
"The old sailor's face was brown like a bay. He had a fringe of hair around his head and a fringe of whip around the edge of his face, running from the ear to his ear and under his chin. His eyes were light blue and kind in expression. His nose was large and wide, and his few teeth were not strong enough to crack the nuts with. Trot loved Cap'n Bill and had a lot of confidence in his wisdom, and a great admiration for her ability to make highs, whistles and toys with her wonderful stretcher. In the village were many boys and girls of her age, but she had never had so much fun playing with them that she had wandered by the sea accompanied by the old sailor and to listen to her fascinating stories."
"They had divided one of the biscuits and munched it for breakfast when they were surprised by a sudden splash in the pool. Looking towards it, they saw the most curious creature ever seen emerge from the water. It was not a fish, Trot decided, and it was not a beast. He had wings, however, and wings more than they were: in the form of a birch inverted and covered with hard skin instead of feathers. He had four legs — like the legs of a stork, only double the number — and his head was in the shape of a good deal like that of a parrot, with a beak bend curved down opposite and upwards to the edges, and was half beaked and half mouth. But to call it a bird was out of question, because he had no feathers, except a crest of wavy plumes of scarlet colour on the very top of his head."
"Colonel Hathaway and his granddaughter stood silently on the platform of this hangar, their luggage beside them, and watched their chests fall out of the luggage car and the train depart, pick up the speed, and fall down on her way. Then the young girl looked around her to discover that the primitive station was really the only barren place in the landscape. For it was not a country of the Western Prairies, but one of the oldest and most prosperous sections of a great state that had been one of the first thirteen to be represented by a star on our national banner. Chargrove was perhaps not much a railway station, for it was only eleven miles from a great city, but the country around it was extremely beautiful."
"In one of the houses lived an old wise Hyup named Bini Aru, who was an intelligent sorcerer. But Ozma d'Oz, who directs all the inhabitants of the land of Oz, had decreed that no one should practice magic in his dominions, except Glinda the Good and the Wizard of Oz, and when Glinda sent this royal command to the Hyups by means of a strong winged eagle, Old Bini Aru stopped at the same time practicing magic arts. He destroyed many of his magic powders and magic tools, and then honestly obeyed the law. He had never seen Ozma, but he knew that she was his leader and had to be obeyed. There was only one thing that had afflicted him. He had discovered a new and secret method of transformation that was unknown to any other sorcererer. Glinda the Good did not know, neither little Wizard of Oz, nor Dr. Pipt nor the old Mombi, nor anyone else who was involved in magic."
"The wind was full on the bird's beam when entering the broken water. Here and there, the dark heads of the rocks showed up above the water. These were quite easy to avoid, the danger was in those hidden under its surface, and the position of which was indicated only by the occasional rupture of a sea as it passed over them. Whenever the bird was flowing over a wave those who were standing on board involuntarily their breath, but the water here was relatively smooth, the sea having passed its first force on the outer reef. With a wave of his hand Tom directed the helmsman as to its course, and the small yacht was beautifully manipulated by the dangers. ""I'm beginning to believe that we will do so,"" said Tom Harvey, who was standing by him. ""Five more minutes and we will be within his reach."" We could now see that there was a group of people gathered in the bow of the wreck."
"I do not want a moment to defend the evil-tempered people, but I think that people who suffer from bad-tempered people often speak as if they were the only ones to suffer in matter; and as if the bad-tempered people themselves liked to be in rage. Yet how much misery is endured by those who have never obtained victory over their own bad temperament! Feeling miserable and exasperated by little troubles that well-humored people get over with a smile or a smile; having things randomized in my mind as a radiance in the flesh, which glide slightly out of yours, and leave no mark; being unable to carry a joke, knowing that one is doubly funny because one cannot; having this fatal wound at heart — ""I can't forgive; I can't forget,"" there is no pleasure in these things."
"In the days of Yare, there were two old poor widows who lived in the same hamlet and under the same roof; but if the cottages were joined and a roof covered them, they each had a separate dwelling; and although they were similar in age and circumstances, but in other respects, they were very different. For one lady was coveted, although she had little to save, and the other was liberal, although she had little to give. Now, on the ground rising in front of the cottages of the widows, there stood a monastery where some pious and charitable brothers spent their time in prayer, work and good works."
"A summer afternoon. At the beginning of the summer, and later in the afternoon; with smells and colors deepening, and shadows extending, towards the evening. Two inflating gaffers, sitting side by side on a wall of Yorkshire. A wall of sandstone of many colors, brighter and yellower as the sun descends; well cushioned with foam and lichen, and deeply planted in the grass on this side, where the path runs, and in the blue jacinths on this side, where the wood is, and where - on the grey and still naked branches of young oaks--sounds diving ravens, no less solemn than the gaffers, and also inflating. A gaffer in the working-day clothes, not a painting of shape and colour. Gray, low at home-knit, and coat and knee-breed cord, which takes shades of time and weather as harmoniously as the wooden palings; so the ground workers (like some insects) seem to absorb or mimic their bodies."
"Pierre Paul and his two sisters played in the pastures. Rich, green, Dutch pastures, not broken by a hedge or a wall, which stretched – like an emerald ocean – on the horizon and met the sky. The cows stood at the ankle and chewed the tail, the clouds slowly sailed on the sea, and on a dry hill, mother sitting, in her broad sun hat, with an eye to the cows and a linen that she was whitening, thinking about her farm. Peter Paul and his sisters had found another small hill where, among some tufts of prairie flowers that the cows had not yet eaten, were dandelion clocks. They divided them fairly, and began to tell each other the hour of the day. Little Anna blew very loud for her waist, and as the wind also blew, her clock was finished in a few puffs."
"The five started, Tommy Todd skating next to Flossie to help her if she had to need it. Tommy was a sort of chum of the two pairs of twins, sometimes going with the older, Nan and Bert, and again with Flossie and Freddie. In fact, he was playing with them more often than with Nan and his twin, because Flossie and Freddie had played a big role in helping Tommy at a time, as I'm going to explain a little later. It was a beautiful winter day, not too cold, and the sun was shining with a clear sky, but not warm enough to melt the ice. The five children's steel skates sounded a happy air by clicking on the frozen surface of the lake. ""Hurrah! We're here!"" finally cried Bert, as he was skating on and sitting on a bench in front of the ""Chocolat Cabin"", as they called it. He started to remove his skates."
"""Oh, I guess Snap just fled for a change, as Frossie and Freddie do sometimes,"" said Bobbsey when he went home that night and was told what had happened. ""He'll come back very well, I'm sure."" But Nan and Bert weren't so sure of that. They knew Snap was too good. He never left like that before. Frossie and Freddie, being younger, weren't worried so much. Besides, they had Snoop, and the cat was more their pet than the dog, who was Bert's favorite, but of course, everyone in the Bobbsey family loved him."
"""Now you all have to eat good breakfast,"" said Grandma Ford, while the six little Bunkers came down to answer their father's call. ""Eat a lot of buckwheat and maple syrup, you won't be cold and hungry when you go out on the ice to skate."" Russ, Laddie and the others didn't need a second invitation, and soon there was a rattle of knives, forks and spoons that said that hungry children were eating with good heart. The house at Great Hedge was warm and comfortable, and the smell of bacon, buckwheat cakes and maple syrup would have made almost anyone hungry. ""We're all going to skate?"" asked Rose, as she was eating her last cake. ""Yes, I'm going to take everything from you,"" said Dad Bunker. ""Dick went to the pond, and he says that the ice is good."
"Mun Bun was not a very disobedient little boy, but as Dad Bunker said, he had a better ""forgett"" than he had the memory. Mun Bun completely forgot that Mother Bunker had told her not to leave the largest state room where she put things in her usual way. Because, as they were to be several days on the steam boat, she must have a place for things and everything in her place, or she could not comfortably take care of Dad and six children. Then, Mun Bun was so fast! As Laddie said: one minute he was there, and the next minute he was not. He seemed to slide straight out of sight. Cowboy Jack had called Mun Bun a quick money blob; and you know that you can't put your finger on a quick money blob, he ran so fast."
"Bunny and his sister, with their dad and mamma, spent the summer at Grandpa Brown's farm away from the country. The kids loved him very much on the farm because they had fun. A few days before they arrived at the circus, they had seen so many wonderful things that they talked about from morning to night, and sometimes even after they got to bed. But just now, for a little while, they didn't talk or thought about the circus, although until the time when Grandpa Brown had come around the house with the basket on his arm, Bunny had told Sue about the man who was clinging to his heels with a trapezeze that was fast at the top of the big tent. A trapezezez, you know, is something like a swing, only he has a stick to sit down instead of a board."
"They passed to Key West, but they did not stop. Alice wondered if they would approach the ""Hole in the Wall"", but she did not like to ask, for fear of making trouble for Jack. She did not know how much of her story he wanted to know to those on board the ship. It was a warm and sunny day, and Mr. Pertell had announced that he would start some of the most important scenes of the drama in a short period of time. Mary Ellen plowed through the blue waters, leaning under a good wind. Almost all the members of the company were on deck, under the awnings. Alice saw Jack Jepson at some work on the rail of the harbour, and noticed Hen Lacomb and the captain walking towards him."
"As for the other girls, they were slowly turning purple in an effort to maintain the solemnity required by the occasion. A strange noise under the car, quickly followed by a choked cough, did not help them, and they were relieved when their victim turned his suspicious look at them towards the shallow ditch at the side of the road that was still muddy from the rain of the previous night. The only hope that he had to move was to drive through this mud. Without a word or a look in their direction, he whipped his team and started for the ditch. It was something that the girls had not planned, and they did not intend to let him pass again. Grace and Amy flashed a distress signal to Betty, who landed on Mollie's feet, the feet being all that could be seen from her, and wept with a particular inflection: ""I think you had to find the problem at that time, Mollie, is not you?"" Mollie took the insinçon and scrambled to her feet."
"Meanwhile, Amy Blackford, the last of the trio who had called the little person with dark hair and pink hair, who was Betty Nelson, had stopped simply to remove the apron in front of her pink-shaped gingham dress and who was now flying along the two short blocks that separated her home from the Nelsons. As for poor Mollie Billette, she was almost distracted. Torn with curiosity, as this young person was very often, to know the facts that had motivated Betty's early call, she could not yet satisfy this curiosity. When she had told Betty that she would be there in five minutes, she had fully wanted to make this promise. But—she had forgotten the twins! Upon entering the room where she had locked them up while she was talking to Betty, she found a view that took her breath enough."
"The morning dawn was clear and bright. Mollie first woke up in the large sunny room that the girls had chosen to occupy together during their stay on Pine Island. It contained two large double beds, each in a clean little alcove. The carpets of unmarked grass, the flowers that bloomed on the wide and latticated windows gave the room an air of joy and comfort that was very pleasant. All this Mollie took subconsciously in her sleepy gaze wandered around the room. Then slowly, the full watch banished the last vestige of sleep from her eyes and sat down in bed. ""The sun!"" she joyfully exclaimed. ""And I was sure it was raining this morning! Oh, now we will see the island as it is. Wake up, Amy, do it! Oh, goodness, how the child sleeps!"" and she shook her sleeping friend with an undoubted hand."
"The golden days of October passed, as so many other Octobers did, and also brown November, and most of the cold December also. Finally came Joyful Christmas, and Eustace Bright with him, doing all the joy through his presence. And the day after his arrival from the college, there came a powerful snowstorm. Until that time, the winter had stood still, and had given us good sweet days, which were like smiles on his rhymed face. The grass had kept green, in sheltered places, like the corners of the southern slopes, and along the edge of the stone fences. It was only a week or two ago, and since the beginning of the month, that the children had found a dandelion in bloom, on the margin of the stream of the shadow, where he glides from the dell."
"In the old city of Troezene, at the foot of a high mountain, lived, a long time ago, a little boy named Theseus. His grandfather, King Pithéus, was the ruler of this land, and was considered a very wise man; so that Asie, being raised in the royal palace, and being naturally a brilliant boy, could not fail to take advantage of the instructions of the old king. Her mother's name was Aethra. As for his father, the boy had never seen him. But from his youngest memory, Aethre went with little Teaea in a wood, and sat on a rock of moss, which was deeply sunk in the earth. Here, she often spoke with her son about his father, and said that he was called Aegean, and that he was a great king, and that he reigned over Attica, and lived in Athens, which was as famous as any city in the world."
"In the meantime, Hercules was constantly traveling on the hills and Dales, and through the solitary woods. Sometimes, he was moving away from his club, and was crisscrossing a powerful oak with a straight blow. His mind was so filled with giants and monsters with which he had the task of fighting, that he might have taken the big tree for a giant or a monster. And Hercules was so eager to reach what he had undertaken, that he almost regretted having spent so much time with the damns, wasting idle breath on the history of his adventures. But it is always with people who are destined to accomplish great things. What they have already done seems less than nothing. What they have taken in hand to do seems worth the pain, the danger, and the life itself."
"He was so tall, and his legs were so long, that the contrast between him and the little mule that he betrode was ridiculous. He was sometimes called ""loosely assembled""; nevertheless, the different parts of him were so massive and muscular that, even if he had been able to build himself loosely, most men would have had trouble to shoot him down. Although willing in grace, he was by no means repulsive, for his face, which was adorned with a beard of soft linen and a moustache of juvenile texture, expressed wonderful depths of the milk of human goodness. He wore boots with the trousers sewn in it, a gray tunic, or a hunting coat, belt at the waist, and a straw hat with broad edges, or sombrero."
"A few features of the row soon placed them on the deck of a large, clumsy ship that anchors at the entrance to the port. It is the barge of the diver, which presents a laying crane with a hook and a pendulum chain at the place where its mast was to be found. Several men are occupied by the bridge, one of whom is seated in the complete dress of a diver, with the exception of the helmet, which is unscrewed and lying on the deck near its heavily weighted feet. The dress is wet, and the man enjoys a quiet pipe, of all that Edgar considers to be resting after a dive. Near the board on which the diver was sitting, there was the chest containing the air pumps. He was open, the pumps were in order to walk, with two men standing to work them."
"As they were a little tired at that time, they hardly uttered a word as they camped, but went to work as if they were half asleep. Cheenbuk lifted up the canoe from the water and placed it on the shore, at the bottom, in the position where he formed a rough tent ready for his companion, who, during that time, carried the provisions. Sitting on the grass next to him, they ate a little dried venison, which did not require cooking, making only a monosyllable from time to time with half-closed eyes, and sometimes with an imbecile smile, which sometimes ended in an irresistible wink. The weakness of the light, as well as the calm of the hour, did not contribute little to this state of semi-consciousness."
"This was the first trip of little Billy at sea in his father's fishing smack, and he didn't go like a passenger but as a ""hand."" It is likely that there was never a way out of Yarmouth a boy who was more proud of his position than the little Billy of the Evening Star. He was rigged up and down in a brand new suit of what we can style nautical clothes. His thin little body was made to appear twice his natural mass by a large shoulders pilot coat, under which was a thick garnsey. He was almost extinguished by a large yellow sou'wester, and everything except swallowed by a pair of sea boots that reached his hips. These boots, in fact, seemed so capaceous that to induce the belief that if he didn't take care of the part of his body that remained outside of them could fall inside and disappear."
"A boater turned to the place where he sat on the bridge, raised his hand, said something that was not a blessing, and the boats dug through the dusk. The great Indian river, which looked more like a chain of small lakes than a stream, was as smooth as the glass, reflecting the sandy red sky in the middle of the canal, but splashed with yellow and dark purple spots near and under the low banks. The small streams ran in the river during the wet season, but now their dry mouths clinged over the water line. On the left bank, and almost under the railway bridge, there was a village of mud and brick and stubble, whose main street, full of cattle going up to their byres, ran straight to the river, and ended with a kind of coarse brick pier, where people who wanted to wash could move step by step."
"And the Rhinoceros did it. He buttoned it with the three buttons, and he tickled like crumbs of cake in the bed. Then he wanted to scratch, but it did worse; and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled and rolled, and every time he rolled the crumbs of cake tickled him worse and worse. Then he ran to the palm tree, rubbed and rubbed and rubbed against her. He rubbed so much and so hard that he rubbed his skin in a large fold on his shoulders, and another fold underneath, where the buttons were (but he rubbed the buttons), and rubbed some other folds on his legs. And he spoiled his temperament, but he didn't make any difference with the crumbs of cake. They were inside his skin and they were tickling."
"Many other pictures were far too beautiful to begin with, especially before lunch, but as they were drawn over and again on the birch bark, they became simpler and easier, until Tegumai even said that he could not find any fault with them. They turned the snake hissy towards the other direction for the Z sound, to show that he was whistled backwards in a soft and gentle way; and they just made a twiddle for E, because he came in the images so often; and they drew pictures of the sacred beaver of the Tegumas for the B sound; and because it was a nasty and crazy sound, they just pulled the nose for the N sound, until they were tired; and they drew a picture of the great mouth of the lake pike for the Ga-vid sound; and they drew the mouth of the pike with a lance behind it for the Ka-sound sound; and they drew photos of a little of the river sinuous and so went out for the wind---and they went for the wind-and-weaked it out for the sound of the Ka-sound."
"They were the ""kings of God,"" and when the old Hobden piled a comfortable brushwood between the large wooden knees of Volaterrae, they called it ""the hands of the giants."" Una slipped into their private space in the fence, and sat down for a while, grooving also scowlily and seigneurily as she knew it; for Volaterrae is an important guard tower coming out of Far Wood just like Far Wood juts out of the hill. Pook's Hill is under it and all the towers of the stream as he wanders out of the woods of Willingford, between the hop gardens, at the old chalet of Hobden at the Forge. The wind of the southwest (there is always a wind of Volaterrae) blew from the bare ridge where Cherry Clack Windmill stands."
"As usual, they settled on the bagbed in front of the fires, and when Hobden drew the shutter, looked at them, as usual, on the bed of coals without flames, casting his heat on the dark well of the old puck. Slowly, he split a few pieces of fresh coal, packed them, with fingers that never went, exactly where they would do the most good; slowly, he reached behind him until Dan bowed the potatoes in his iron ball with one hand; carefully he arranged them around the fire, then he stood for a moment, black against the glare. As he closed the shutter, the water house seemed dark before the end of the day, and he lit the candle in the lanternhorn. The children loved all these things because they knew them so well. The bee boy, the son of Hobden, who was not quite right in his head, though he might do anything wrong."
"It is sad but true. Autumn is often called the sad moment of the year, and it is the sad moment. But it should not be. Old Mother Nature never wanted it to be. She wanted it to be the happy moment. This is the time when all the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows have overcome the worries and worries of raising families and teaching their children how to take care of themselves. It is the season when food is abundant, and everyone is fat and is, or should be, free. It is the season when the Old Mother Nature has planned for all her little people to be happy, to have nothing to worry about for the short time before the onset of cold weather and the difficult times that cold weather always brings."
"When Blacky the Crow discovered that the eggs in the old nest of Redtail the Hawk in a lonely corner of the Green Forest belonged to Hooty the Owl, he immediately made the best of resolutions; he would simply forget all those eggs. He would forget that he had never seen them, and he would stay away from that corner of the Green Forest. It was a very wise resolution. Of all the people who live in the Green Forest, none is more ferocious or wilder than Hooty the Owl, unless it is Mrs. Hooty. She is bigger than Hooty and certainly as much to fear by the little people. All this Blacky knows. No one knows better. And Blacky is not the one who gets into trouble with her eyes open."
"Happy Jack stood up as if he wanted to start hunting again, but he had a hard time running so hard and so long, and so he sat again. In his heart, Happy Jack knew that Chatterer was right, that the tree was no more his own than his cousin. But when he thought of all those big nuts with which the great hackory had been loaded, greedy thoughts drove all the right thoughts away and he said again, as he had said when he saw his cousin, that Chatterer should not have one of them. He stopped scolding long enough to steal a look at them, and then—what do you think Happy Jack did? Why, he gave such a leap of surprise that he almost lost his balance. Not a nut to see! Happy Jack flashed. Then, he rubbed his eyes and looked again. He couldn't see a nut anywhere!"
"It was a very pleasant and comfortable place. You see, happy, round, bright Mr. Sun poured his warmest rays there from the blue and blue sky. When old grandmother Fox was tired, she often slipped over there for a short nap and sunbathing even in winter. She was quite sure that nobody knew anything about it. It was one of her secrets. This morning, old grandmother Fox was very tired, in an unusual way. First, she had been hunting all night. Then, before she could reach home, Bowser the Hound had found his tracks and started following them. Of course, it wouldn't have been done to go home then."
"Tom had started his inventive work when, a few years before the opening of this story, he had negotiated for Mr. Damon's motorcycle, after this machine had turned his owner in a tree. Mr. Damon was, of course, perhaps very disgusted, and sold the cheap deal. Tom repaired, made some improvements, and in the first volume of this series, entitled ""Tom Swift and his bike-cycle"", you can read his rather exciting adventures on his fast foot of road. From then on, Tom had spent a busy life, doing a lot of machines and having some exciting moments with them. Just before the opening of this story Tom had made a particular instrument, described in the volume entitled ""Tom Swift and his photo-telephone."" With this, a person who spoke could not only see the characteristics of the person he was conversing with, but, by means of a selenium plate and a kind of camera, a permanent image of the person could be taken at either end of the wire."
"""Oh Tom, is it really safe?"" A young lady, extremely pretty young lady, could call herself, grabbed a small hand gloved on a plane wing, and looked at a young man, dressed in a leather, fur suit, who was sitting in the cockpit of the machine just above her. ""Sure, Mary?"" repeated the pilot, as he arrived under the hood of the boat to make sure of one of the controls. ""Why, you should know at that time that I would not go up if it were not safe!"" ""Oh, yes, I know, Tom. This may be good for you, but I've never been in this kind of airship before, and I want to know if it's safe for me."" The young man leaned on the edge of the padded cockpit, and shoved in his rather grim hand the young lady's glove."
"""It's Tom Swift!"" cried Sam Snedecker. ""Look, or you'll knock him down!"" ""Let him stand out of my way,"" replied Andy savagely. ""The young man on the wheel, with a sudden push of speed, tried to cross the highway. He managed to do so, but by such a narrow margin that in a very terror Andy Foger turned off the current, blocked the brakes and headed on one side. So he suddenly had to walk on the side of the road, where he climbed, bowing on one side. Tom Swift, his face a little pale from his narrow escape, jumped off his bike, and stood on the car. As for the occupants of this machine, Andy Foger, the owner, to the three friends who were driving with him, they all seemed very surprised."
"""Say, stand there, Ned! Wait! Where do you find this thing, as the boys say? Did something go wrong with one of the add-on machines, or is it just because of the heat? What's the big idea, anyway? How many millions did you say?"" and Tom Swift, the talented young inventor, looked at Ned Newton, his financial manager, with a quizze smile. ""That's good, Tom! It's good!"" said Ned, and he only needed a glance to show that he was more serious than his companion. ""I don't suffer from the heat, although the thermometer is almost ninety-five in the shade. And if you want to know where I get this thing, read that!"" He looked at his boyfriend, his employer and his friend — because Tom Swift assumed the three relationships with Ned Newton — a part of a newspaper on Sunday. He was turned to a big rubber page with a big hole in his face. He was turned to a big rubber page with a big hole in his face."
"Stopping his agitated walk up and down the room, Tom Swift rushed to the window and looked through the field towards the many buildings, where the machines turned the products from his father's brain and himself. There was a worried look on the young inventor's face, and he seemed concerned, as if he thought of something far from what he was looking at. ""Well, I'm going to do it!"" suddenly cried Tom. ""I don't want to, but I will do it. It's in the line of ""doing my part,"" I guess; but I'd prefer it to be something else. I wonder, ""Ha! until your old towers, I see, Tom!"" cried a voice, in which energy and friendliness blended pleasantly. ""Until your old towers!"" ""Hello, Mr. Damon!"" cried Tom, turning to shake the hand of an elderly man, that is to say, aged in appearance, but not in action, because he crossed the air of an old room."
"The next few days were occupied for Tom, Ned and, in fact, the entire Swift house. Tom and his father had several consultations and conducted several experiments with the new stabilizer, whose completion was so seriously desired. Mr. Swift was sure that he could bring the invention to a successful conclusion. Ned was engaged in shaping the financial affairs of the Swift Company, so that they were running almost during his absence. Then, there was also the packing of their luggage that had to be seen. Of course, the main details of the trip were left to Professor Bumper, who knew exactly what to do. He had told Tom and Ned that all they and Mr. Damon had to do would be to meet him at the New York pier, where they would find all the arrangements made. One day, near the end of the week (the beginning of the next week being planned) Eradice came to the room where Tom would sort out the possessions he wanted to take with him, Ned assisting him in the task."
"Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the snowflakes fell like feathers of the clouds, a queen sat down at the window of her palace, which had an ebony black frame, sewing her husband's shirts. While she was engaged and looking at the snow, she was plucking her finger, and three drops of blood fell on the snow. But the red seemed so well on the white as she thought: ""Oh, that I had a child as white as this snow, as red as this blood, and as black as the wood of this frame!"" Shortly afterwards, a little girl came to her, who was as white as the snow, and with cheeks as red as the blood, and with hair as black as the ebony, and from there she was called ""white snow."""
"Aladin's mother laughed at the idea that his son wanted to be the son-in-law of the sultan, and told him to immediately take such thoughts out of his head. But Aladin did not mock his fantasy. At that time he knew that the fruits he had collected from the magic garden were jewels of great value, and he insisted that his mother should lead them to the sultan for a present, and asked the hand of the princess in the marriage for her son. The poor woman was terribly scared, fearing that the sultan would punish her for her impudence; but Aladin heard no excuse, and finally she was afraid and trembling, carrying the jewels on a porcelain dish covered with a towel. The sultan smiled at the idea of the son of a poor old woman asking for her daughter's hand."
"The master of the cat was so surprised to hear his cat speak, that he immediately obtained what he wanted. The cat pulled on the boots and plunged the bag around the neck and left for a warren rabbit. When he arrived, he filled his bag with bells and lettuce, and stretched next to him as dead, waited for a young rabbit to be tempted in the bag. This happened very quickly. A fat rabbit, without thought, bowed to the head, and the cat immediately jumped, pulled the ropes and killed him. Puss was very proud of his success, and, going to the king's palace, he asked to speak to the king. When he was shown to the king's presence, he bowed respectfully, and, posing the rabbit before the throne, he said, ""Here is a rabbit, which my master, the Marquis of Carabas, wishes to present to me to your Majesty."""
"On the door of the castle, he found a trumpet of gold suspended, under which were written these words: ""Whoever can sound this trumpet, will cause the giant to be overthrown."" Jack seized the trumpet of gold and sounded a mighty breath, which opened the doors and shaken the castle to its foundations. The giant and the magician, knowing that their end was now near, stood biting their thumbs and trembling with terror. Jack, with his magic sword, soon killed the giant, and the magician was carried away by a whirlwind. The castle disappeared like smoke, and the daughter of the duke, and all the knights and beautiful ladies who had been turned into birds and beasts returned to their own form."
"Dick went safely to London, and was in such a hurry to see the beautiful streets paved with gold, that he ran through many of them, thinking every moment to come to those who were paved with gold; for Dick had seen a guinea pig three times in his own little village, and remembered how much money it brought about change; so he thought he had nothing to do but take a few small pieces of sidewalk, and he would then have as much money as he could wish. Poor Dick ran until he was tired, and had completely forgotten his friend the driver. Finally, finding that he was darkened, and every time he turned, he saw only dirt at the place of gold, he sat down in a dark corner, and cried to sleep."
"And it came to pass once that the father went to the fair, and asked his wife's daughters what he should bring to them. ""Fine garments,"" said the first, diamonds,"" said the second. ""Now, child,"" said he to his own daughter, ""what will you have?"" The first strand, dear father, who rubs against your hat on your way back, says she. ""Then he bought for the first two the beautiful garments, pearls and diamonds that they had asked for; and on his way home through a green rose, a strand of hazelnut brushed against him, and almost out of his hat; and he broke it and took it away; and when he came home, he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it and went to his mother's grave and planted it there, and shouted so much that he was watered with his tears; and there he grew up and became a beautiful tree. Three times every day she went to her and she wept there; and soon a little bird came on it, and soon came to build it."
"For some time, Honey behaved so well that the ring did not snatch at all, but one day when he came back from the chase, having not caught anything, he felt so bad, that when his dog Bibi came to flageller on him, he struck the poor faithful creature of him. At that time, the ring snuck like a pin running in his finger. ""What is it?"" he exclaimed, ""The fairy must make fun of me, surely I didn't do much harm in hitting an animal that bore me. What is the point of being the leader of a great empire if I can't treat my dog as I want?"" ""I don't mock you, did he hear the answer to his thoughts; you've been badly soaked, and you've done wrong to a poor animal that doesn't deserve such treatment. I know that you're higher than a dog, but the advantage of being the leader of a great empire is the advantage of doing everything wrong."""
"Very rarely one day he passed without his buying dogs, his little dogs, his great sports dogs, his spies, his dogs, his dogs of all kinds. When he found a beautiful dog, and then came even better, he let go first, to be alone — the princes had refused to take any attendant — he could not take in charge thirty or forty thousand dogs. He moved, keeping a road, until one night, during a storm of thunder and rain, he lost his way, and after some wanderings arrived in a very superb castle where no one was to be seen, but a dozen hands all holding torches. Other hands pushed him forward, and guided him through one apartment after another, so rich in precious stones and beautiful paintings, that it was like an enchantment. After having crossed sixty rooms, his hands stopped him, and there the prince's wet clothes were carried away, and he was clothed in a garment of the most exquisite description."
"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a Beast. It was a Great Beast, and lived in a large castle that stood in the middle of a large park, and everyone in the country held the Beast in great fear. In fact everything about the Beast was great; its roaring was great and great and could be heard for miles around the park, and when it roared the people trembled. No one ever saw the Beast, which was by no means remarkable, because the Beast never came out of its park, and no one, I can assure you, never ventured on its domain. But things were not allowed forever, because something very wonderful happened to the Beast and to someone else, and if something had not happened that story would never have been written."
"Once upon a time there was a queen who had the ugliest little baby imaginable, if ugly, indeed, that it was almost impossible to believe that he was a little boy at all. A fairy, however, assured her mother that the little baby would be very good and intelligent, saying that she would also give her a gift that would allow her to return this person he loved the best than himself. This consoled the queen a little, but she was very unhappy because her son was so ugly, although he had not started talking about all sorts of things early, and he had so many nice ways that people were charmed with him. I forgot to say, that when he was a whole baby, he had a funny little tuft of hair on his head, so his name was Tufty Riquet, because Riquet was the family name."
"Then the logger finally began to sell Thurling to strangers for a large piece of gold. ""Where do you want to sit?"" said one of them. ""Oh, put me on the edge of your hat, it will be a beautiful gallery for me; I can walk there, and see the land as we go."" They did what he wanted; and when Thurling took his father's leave, they took him away with them. They passed until he began to be dark, and then the little man said, ""Let me go down, I am tired."" Then the man took his hat and put him on a gutter of land in a field ploughed on the side of the road, but Thurling ran in the middle of the eyebrows, and finally slipped into a hole of mice. ""Good night, masters,"" he said, ""I am leaving!"
"The day, the month, and the year stood by him, and beside them were the Hours. Spring was there, his head was covered with flowers; summer, crowned with ripe grain; autumn, with his feet imprisoned by the juice of the grapes; and winter, with hair all white and stiff with frost. And when Phaeton went up the golden steps that led to his father's throne, it seemed that the incarnate youth had come to the court of the god of the sun, and that the youth was so beautiful that she should live forever. Apollo knew him proudly for his son, and when the boy looked with the arrogance of the fear of childhood, the god greeted him kindly and asked him to tell him why he was coming, and what was his request."
"Under the water flowing quickly from a deep river, the nymph that was Aristoe's mother sat on her throne. Fish darted around her white feet, and beside her sat down with her handmaidens, turning the green cords that were split around the throats of those who perished when their arms could no longer fight against the force of the rushing current. A nymph was singing as she was working, an old, old song, which told one of the old tales of man's weakness and the power of the water creatures, but above her singing those who listened to the voice of a man, calling loudly and pitifully. The voice was that of Aristoe, calling aloud his mother."
"During the tropical nights, one can hear their sounds, like bells, coming from the marshes, and when they are invisible, the song of bull frogs would suggest creatures full of solemn dignity. The croque of their little brothers is less impressive, but there is no escape of that evening when the iridescent wings of dragon flies are folded into sleep, and the birds in the branches are always, when the lilies on the pond have closed their golden hearts, and even the late trout have stopped planting and making whirlwinds in the quiet water. ""Krroak! krroak! krroak!"" they go—""Krroak! krroak! krroak! krroak!"" It is endlessly, endlessly. It continues as the whirlwind of the wheels of a great clock that can never come down — a melancholy complaint against the trials of fate — a rough protest against things as they are."
"Only once, during these three hundred years, did the sons of Lîr see none of their friends; and when they saw them ascending on the shore at the mouth of the Bann, on the north coast of Erin, a company with gallant garments, with sparkling arms, and riding on white horses, the swans rushed to meet them; and they were glad that day, for the company was led by two sons of Bodb the Red, who had sought swans along the rocky coast of Erin for several days, and brought them greetings of love to the good king of the Dedannans and their father Lîr."
"Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron. She had a little pile in her hand. But she couldn't sell her matches. No one would buy them. Poor little Gretchen! She was cold and hungry. The snow fell on her curly hair. But she didn't think about it. She saw lights in the houses. She felt the good things cooking. She thought, ""It's the last night of the year."" Gretchen was colder and colder. She was afraid to go home. She knew that her dad would be angry at her, if she didn't take money from her. It was as cold at home as on the street. They were too poor to have a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep the wind. Gretchen didn't even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags."
"They made a big fire, but the meat didn't want to cook. They made the fire bigger and bigger, but the meat didn't want to cook. Then the gods were very crossed. Someone said, ""Give me my share, and I will cook the meat."" The gods looked to see who was talking. There in an oak was a great eagle. The gods were so hungry that they said, ""Well, we will do it."" Dinner was ready in a minute. Then the eagle flew away to get his share. He took the four legs and there weren't many lefts but the ribs. It made Loki cross so that he was very hungry. He took a long post to hit the eagle. But the post glued to the eagle's claws. The other end glued to Loki. Then the eagle flew away. He didn't fly high. He just flew to Loki to hit against the stones. Loki said, ""Please let me go!"
"Sif was Thor's wife. Sif had long golden hair. Thor was very proud of Sif's gold hair. Thor always went on long trips. One day he left and left Sif alone. She went out on the porch and fell asleep. Loki came. He always played tricks. He saw Sif lying down. He said, ""I'm going to cut her hair."" Loki therefore went up on the porch and cut Sif's gold hair. When Sif woke up and saw that her hair had gone, she cried and wept. Then she ran to hide. She didn't want Thor to go. When Thor came home, he couldn't find Sif. ""Sif! Sif!"" he called, ""Where are you?"" But Sif didn't answer. Thor looked all around the house. Finally, he found her crying. ""Oh, Thor, look, all my hair is gone! Someone cut her. He runs away with it."
"A long time ago, there was a king in Greece. He had two little children, a boy and a girl. They were good children and they loved each other very much. One day they played in the garden. ""Oh, Helle, look!"" said the boy. ""There, on the grass, there was a beautiful large sheep. This sheep had a golden fleece and its horns were also gold. The children wanted to pat the sheep, but they could not catch it. When they approached, he fled on the clouds. Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came too."
"The next day Jason went to the king and said to him, ""Give me the golden fleece."" The king didn't give it to him, but he said, ""Come back."" Médéa said, ""If you want the golden fleece, you must help yourself. My father won't give it to you. A dragon is near the tree where the golden fleece is, and he never sleeps. He is always hungry and eats people if they approach him. I can't kill him, but I can make him sleep. He loves the cake very much. I will make cake and put something to make the dragon sleep. Médéa made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the dragon. The dragon ate them all and went to sleep. Jason went up on the dragon and took out the nail of the tree. He put the golden fleece under his coat and ran to the ship Argo. Médéa went with him and became his wife."
"Joachim took a pencil and sat down. Now he thought he could please his Mother; but, alas, he found to his surprise, that the beautiful faces he tried to recall had not left this vivid impression on his brain that allowed him to represent them. On the contrary, he was tormented and flouted by visions of strange forms and grotesque faces that he had so often photographed. He seized the Indian ruby and rubbed his nose after the nose for no purpose, for he could never replace them with a better one. The drawing was his favorite entertainment; and this disappointment, where he waited for success, broke his already depressed heart. He threw the book of him, and burst into tears. ""Joachim! Did you pull him? What makes you cry? ""I cannot draw him, Mother, drunk the afflicted boy. Why not?"
"Lady Madeline's eldest son, Roderick, seemed always the most favored by the fairy in the pretty things that she sent down, and certainly he was a very nice boy, and a very good one on the whole—researcher and honest as the day, and very intelligent; but I can't tell you, dear readers, that he had no faults, for it was not at all probable, and you wouldn't believe it if I said it, even if he had to be the hero of my story. Now I don't want to make you laugh about him, but the story requires that I reveal to you one of his weak points. Well, although he was six years old, he was afraid to be alone in the dark! Sometimes, when he was in the big dining room with his father and mother at dinner, she might ask him to take something for her from the living room that was close; but, you know, if there were no candles in the room, he would look very stupid and refuse to go, even if there was a fire."
"For what is the giants, but the great men and women? and the world abound with people who consider themselves to belong to this class. And many of them — the giants of speed, the giants of wealth, the giants of rank — do not know how many things besides, which walk every day in the world, often feel raised above the point of taking care of trifles; so that you may see that I can say (in an allegorical sense) strictly of them that they cannot see carravian seeds. Oh, my dear ones, as high as you are, or that you become; as great, rich or learned, be careful, I pray you, to be a giant who cannot see a carravian seed! For, as my explanation of the moral sense now continues to show you; it is so far from being, as these giants suppose, proof of their superiority that they cannot see or notice things that they consider to be under them — it is a proof of their moral fault or of their intellect — it is a proof of their in fact of their imperfectness."
"Poppypink sat in bed and yawned. ""Why does everyone get up so early?"" she asked. ""Is it a party?"" The older fairies dressed and brushed their long fine hair. ""Wonderwings comes to see us,"" they said. "" Jump up, little Poppypink."" ""Who is Wonderwings?"" she asked. ""You'll see when you're dressed. Hurry up, or you'll miss it."" The older fairies dressed and painted ""The older fairies dressed up and painted their long fine hair."" ""Oh, I'm so asleep,"" said Poppypink, and she baked again."
"""Who comes in here can never come back to Fairyland,"" she said, and her voice was softer than the birds' songs. Fairy Tenderheart pushed the door and walked into the garden. ""Who comes in here finds joy,"" said the oldest of the Fairies, and a crown of happiness sat on her hair. ""You come to work?"" she asked. ""I come to learn what I can do to help the suffering land,"" said Fairy Tenderheart. ""Her agony screams struck on my heart until there was no rest for me in Fairyland. Is there no way to stop the war? I come to you for wisdom."" The oldest of the Fairies rose and smiled, and her face was brighter than the moon and the stars. ""Look at my flowers,"" she said, ""and tell me what you think is most beautiful."""
"These ten little live games can be held in the hand of each baby, five out of one and five on the other and be the baby always so poor but he still has these ten games because, you know, he brings them with him. But all babies don't know how to play with them. They discover for themselves a lot of ways to play with them, but here are some of the ways that a baby I knew was amused by him. The first was the play called ""Ta-ra-cheese"". It's a Dutch word and there was a little song about all this in Dutch. It's the way the baby I knew would play when he was a little boy. His mom held his hand and slowly moved it around that way by singing ""Ta-ra-cheese, ta-ra-che!"" Baby would look and watch for a moment, and currently her little hand would start to move and five small games would start the play — sweet pink little chubby fingers."
"Arabella had a little red ball attached to a long rope, and Araminta had a little blue ball attached to a long rope. Arabella rolled her ball, and her little white kitten ran and jumped for her. Araminta rolled her ball, and her little black kitten ran and jumped for her. The kittens were so cunning and funny, and they had such a splendid time. Sometimes when the kitten of Arabella ran very fast, or jumped very high, Arabella laughed until she fell on the ground. And sometimes when the kitten of Araminta ran very fast, or jumped very high, Araminta laughed until she fell on the ground. Oh, they had a splendid weather. But once their mother lifted their eyes from her seam, and said, ""Good night, Arabella. Good night, Araminta. The clock is on eight."""
"""How can I go to bed,"" said Penny, the brilliant dog, ""until I say good night to baby Ray? He gives me some of his bread and milk, and slaps me with his sweet little hand. It's bedtime now for dogs and babies. I wonder if he's sleeping?"" So he was trotting in his silky white nightshirt until he finds Baby Ray on the porch in mom's arms. And she was telling him the same little story that I told you: The dog that was given to him to keep, keep, keep, Went to see if baby Ray was sleeping, sleeping, sleeping. ""How can we go to bed,"" said Snowdrop and Thattledown, Tabby's youngest children, the cat, ""until we have once again looked at baby Ray? He lets us play with his blocks and balloon, and laughs when we get on the table."
"The sun was up and the breeze was blowing, and the five chicks, four geese, three rabbits, and two kittens, and a little dog were just as loud and sharp as they knew it. They were all watching for Baby Ray to appear in the window, but he was still sleeping very fast in his little white bed, while mom was preparing the things he would need when he woke up. First, she went on her way to the orchard to the old wooden pump, and said, ""Good pump, will you give me clear and pleasant water for the baby's bath?"" And the pump was ready. The good old pump near the orchard path gave clear and pleasant water for the baby's bath. Then she went a little further on the way, and stopped at the log, and said, ""Good chips, the pump gave me clear water for the dear baby Ray; would you come to warm up the water and cook her food?"""
"After eating everything they wanted, they thought they were going to go for a walk and see this strange world in which they had come to live. Shortly afterwards, they arrived at a stream, and they all stood in order and looked in it. ""Let's have a drink,"" they said, ""and they lowered their heads when--Peep, peep!"" said Spottie. ""I see a little chicken with a spot on their heads."" ""No, no, no, no, no, Brownie said; there's a ring around their neck, and it looks like me."" ""Peep, peep!"" said Daisy. ""I think it's like me, because it's yellow and white."" And I don't know, but they would all have burned to see if they hadn't felt something falling at the ends of their nose. ""What's that?"" said Fluffy."
"Little Philip loved horses very much, and as he was too old to sit on a chair, a box or a safe and make him think that a rocking horse was pulling him along his bedroom, his father bought him a brown and white spotted horse, with a beautiful white mane; and Philippe liked to stand on his back. In winter, he went out in his sled, even when the snow was deep. It was fun to be in the sled all wrapped comfortable and warm in fur dresses. He feared his long whip and made his noise almost as loud as a firecracker. He wore a make-up gun when he dressed in his ""Rough-Rider"" suit and went riding. But all the neighbors thought it was funny that Philip always left the saddle on his horse when he went out in his sled."
"Elinor's grandmother had two beautiful dogs: ""Bruno"", a big collie, and ""Bounder"", a small farmer. And when they saw the little girl jump out of the car, they barked and barked because they were so happy to see her. And they said to each other (I think they were saying to each other): ""We will let her sleep well until night, because she must be very tired and it is almost dark. But tomorrow, bright and early, we will ask her to come with us in the garden, and show her how nice it is to live in the country than in the city, where the little girls must walk so quietly in the streets, and the dogs must be driven along the sidewalk, and cannot frown on the green grass."" Elinor was very asleep after her long journey on the train, and therefore, after her supper, her grandmother told her that she could go to bed early and sleep well, and that Nurse Norah would call her at seven o'clock in the morning."
"All of a sudden, he heard someone talking, and he hid behind the broom and was as motionless as possible. He was the little boy Johnnie, who lived upstairs. He had a big hammer and a saw in his hand, and he was talking to his little sister. ""I think this large empty box at the bottom of the cellar would make a beautiful house of dolls, Maggie. I can fix a small porch there, and make stairs and stairs,"" said the little boy. ""Oh, Johnnie, it will be lovely,"" said his little sister. ""I will do something for you one day. Perhaps — perhaps — I will draw a slate full of el'phants, for you to look at!"" Then they started to go down the steps of the cellar. Mr. Squeaky was so scared that he almost fell down the stairs."
"Once, just as the long and dark time that is at the end of each day came, Mother Hare told Tiny Hare, who was at stake, ""Come in, now it's time to go to bed. You know that you have to hide from the man, the dog, and the Hawk; but I have to tell you that you have to hide from Cat, too."" ""Who is the cat?"" said Tiny Hare. ""Cat is not as big as the dog. She has a soft fur and two big wild eyes."" ""She is just like me,"" said Tiny Hare. ""I have a soft fur and big eyes; then Cat is only a hare."" ""The idea itself!"" said Mama Hare. ""You don't have big wild eyes, and your tail is not long like Cat's. The cat is not good for a hare to meet. She can run very fast, and she has a claw for each ore."""
"The good father Hare took his nap, and mother Hare took his nap. The Wee Hare closed his eyes, and threw his ears, but he did not take a nap. He went out of the door and ran until he came to the wood. Then he ran and ran into the wood, but he did not come to the RED FIRE, and he ran and ran until he had a pain in his feet, but he did not come to the RED FIRE, and he ran and ran until he could no longer run, and he did not see RED FIRE. He lay down to rest in a bush, and very quickly his eyes were closed, and he did not see or hear, for there was no time for his nap. When he woke up SNOW spread over all the open tracks of the wood. The Wee Hare made a jump from his bush, for he knew that SNOW could grow deeply and deeply, and that a hare could not walk there."
"One day, a Donkey told Little Half Chick about the Good King and his Animal Farm. Little Half Chick immediately started hoppity-hop for Mother Hen and said, ""Mother Hen, I'm going to Madrid to see the Good King."" ""Very well,"" said Mother Hen, ""good luck for you."" So Little Half Chick started, hoppity-hop, hoppity-hop along the road to Madrid to see the Good King. Soon, she met a two-legged cat that was running along hippity-hip, hippity-hip on her leg and crutch. The Cat said, ""Hello, Little Half Chick, where are you going so fast?"" Little Half Chick said, ""I'm going to Madrid to see the Good King."" ""Can I go too?"" said the Two-legged Cat. ""Yes,"" said Little Half Chick, ""falls behind."""
"He wanted to go home, but he had rolled him so hard, that he could not say where the house was. Then he ran into a corn field to hide, until he was sure that the black and white thing had gone. Soon a man came to find him in the corn field and said to him, ""Hello, pink pig, you eat my corn?"" Oh, no, said the little pig. ""I don't want to eat your corn."" Then you have to stand out of my corn field,"" said the man. ""I'm going to take you home and close you in a feather."" And he took the little pink pig home and shut him in a feather. ""I don't want to be locked up."
"""We are near her now,"" the squirrel announced. ""Come over there, and go slowly, Fuzzy Wuz, because Juggerjook has sharp ears."" They died through the bushes some distance after that, but spoke only with whispers. Fuzzy knew that it was a bold thing to do. They had nothing to wear to the terrible Juggerjook, and we knew that he was always punishing those who came to his den without giving him gifts. But the rabbit leaned on Chatter Chuk's promise that the tyrant of the forest never knew that they were near him. Juggerjook was considered a great magician, to be sure, but Chatter Chuk was not afraid of him."
"The little boy ran and brought parsley and cabbage leaves for the rabbit; and when the rabbit saw this, he turned to the house with haste, lest he be tempted to eat before the hour. The little girl brought a beautiful large mushroom for the turtle, for she had seen a turtle snack all around the edge of a mushroom. ""The Owl will have to bring her own dinner,"" said the boy, ""but I will give her a piece of bread to eat with him."" He did. That night, the little girl and the boy returned home at the moonlight of their grandmother's farm. When they were in their room, they looked out the window towards the corn field."
"Then they went down the bars, the dog, the cat, the cock, the duck, the little white pig with the curly tail, and the little boy, and the little girl, all of them came in to see the cow. The little girl went up on the cow's back, and the little boy went up on the cow's back, and the dog jumped on the cow's back, and the cat jumped on the cow's neck, and the cock flew on the cow's head, and the little white pig with the curly tail, and the duck walked behind the cow, and they all went down together on the road as happy as they could. ""Hello, dirty, come walk with us."""
"Once upon a time there were three bears living in a castle in a large wood. One of them was a large bear, and one of them was a simmered bear, and one of them was a small bear. And in the same wood there was a fox living alone; his name was Scrapefoot. He was very afraid of the bears, but for all that he wanted to know much about them. And one day, as he went through the wood, he was near the castle of the bears, and he wondered if he could enter into the castle. He looked all around him everywhere, and he could see no one. So he climbed up very quietly, until he finally went up to the door of the castle, and he tried if he could open it. Yes! the door was not locked, and he just opened a small way, and he put his nose and looked, and he could see no one."
"""My master gave me a little sugar, and I began to think that perhaps being photographed was not so bad, after all. Today, a man came. He looked very surprised, and he said, ""Why, I thought you took a seat for ""a descendant of one of the first settlers?"" ""That's how I did it,"" replied my master; ""that's where I stood, flashing with all my power."" ""Why, it's a bear!"" cried the man. ""Well, he's a relative of a few first settlers, all the same,"" replied my master."
"As soon as the wife of the Hedgehog was ready, they went away together, and on the way he said, ""Now make sure that I tell you. On the long field, we will decide our bet. The Hare must run on one side of the hedge and I on the other, and all you have to do is stop at one end of the hedge, and then when the Hare arrives on the other side at the same point, you must call, ""I am already there."" They soon came to the field, and the Hedgehog sat at one end of the hedge, and his wife at the other end; and as soon as they had taken their places, the Hare arrived. ""Are you ready to begin?"" asked the Hare. ""Yes,"" replied the Hedgehog, and each took its place."
"And the little shepherd said, ""Where are you going, little Robin?"" And the little Robin answered, ""I go to the king to sing a happy Christmas song to him."" And the little shepherd said, ""Come here, little Robin, and I will give you crumbs of my lunch."" But the little Robin said, ""No, little shepherd, no, no! You caught the Goldfinch, but you can't catch me!"" Then the little Robin flew away until he came to the king; and there he sat on a plow, and sang to the king a joyful song. And the king said to the queen, ""What shall we give to little Robin for singing this joyful song?"" And the queen replied to the king, ""I think we will give him the Wee Wren to be his wife."" So little Robin and little Wren were married, and the king and queen, and all the court was dancing at the wedding."
"When Tuesday came, Edith's nurse dressed her in a cool white pants, and Edith dressed her doll in her best dress, and went out under the trees where her nurse had laid the table for two. And then she sat in a chair at the table and waited. But the big city clock hit four and not Helen came; and then she waited for half an hour more. Then Edith put her doll on the chair and went into the house to find her mother. ""Mom,"" she said, ""I think Helen is very rude, she doesn't come to my party and I invite her!"" ""Just wait a little more, dear,"" said her mother, ""and she will come. Maybe her nurse was busy dressing Helen's little sister and brother and couldn't prepare her in time."""
"On the morning of the first day of the school, Dorothea was suddenly awakened by a ting-a-ling. She sat in the bed and rubbed her eyes. The room was flooded with morning light and the brass buttons on her bed kissed her joyfully and seemed to say, ""Arise, get up!"" Dorothea was a ""child head"" and it was rarely known that she was up when she was awake. Usually, she received at least three calls from her mother or girls, and sometimes Jim stole and administered a ""cold pig"", that is, a few drops of cold water pressed on her neck of a sponge, before she was ready to leave her comfortable bed."
"When Doris came home, she opened her painting box. What do you think? Of course, it was only a cheap paint box and the paintings were so hard that they didn't paint at all. Doris cut the dolls, but they were no better than the color supplement of a newspaper. Doris' mother said that the candy was too bad to eat at all, and the rubber balloons folded and soft at night, because the gas came out of them. Doris cried when she saw them. ""Now,"" she said, ""I have nothing more of my fair dollar but 15 cents."" ""I'm sorry, dear,"" said Doris' mom, ""but it's bad enough to have wasted a dollar without crying about it, too."
"It was after dinner that the tragedy occurred. The children had all begun to walk. Before they left more than a kilometer from the house, the fog settled all around them – so dense, so thick, erasing everything, that they could see more than a step forward. However, they were not afraid, like all they had to do was to turn around and go straight to the house. The children took hands of each other in the direction of Gretel, stretching on the road, Katharine, who held Gretel's hand, being at one end of the line."
"A square package appeared in the door, and it drew him to her. Attached to her was a third block. She untied as before, and removed the paper from her gift. It was a small chest. She lifted the cover, and there was missing Dolly's clothes! A blue dress, a pink dress, a white dress, delicate underwear, sash ribbons, a coat and a hat, and even a small comb and a brush, were found in this beautiful chest. Of course, Dolly had to get out of her corner in the pillows, and be dressed. It took some time, because Little Cousin had to stop to admire each separate garment. Finally, however, the third gift was pulled in, and it was a chair for Dolly to sit down. The fourth package was large and heavy enough than the others. The Little Cousin wondered what he could be, and she found as soon as she could open it."
"One day his mother said to him, ""Come, Red Riding Hood, I want you to go and see your grandmother, and take a piece of cake and a bottle of wine for her; for she is sick and weak, and it will do her good. Do quickly and prepare before the weather is too hot, and go straight on your way while you are out, and act carefully and modestly; and do not run, for fear that you will fall and break the bottle, and then grandmother would have no wine. And when you pass through the village, do not forget to show courtesy and say ""Hello"" to all those who know you."
"In the lake a large leaf of tulip was floating. It was Thumblina's little boat. Sitting there, she sailed side by side with her little lake, rowing skillfully with two white horse hairs. By rowing back and forth, she sang gently to herself. The woman who listened, and thought she had never known such a sweet song. And now such a sad thing happened. Through a broken window, there was a big toad — oh, a big toad so ugly! She climbed on the table, where Thumblina slept dreaming in her little cradle, under the pale pink leaf."
"One evening, shortly before Christmas, as he had cut off the usual quantity, he said to his wife before going to bed, ""What say you to stop that night, to see who is so kind to help us?"" His wife was satisfied, and she fixed a light; and then they hid themselves in the corner of the room, where some clothes hung up that hid them. As soon as it was midnight, two little models came, who squatted on the board; and, taking the prepared work, put on their little fingers, seams and seams, and hammering so quickly and lightly, that the shoemaker could not remove their eyes to astonish themselves. They did not stop until everything was finished, and the shoes stood ready on the table; and then they sprang quickly."
"One morning in January, the weather being very harsh, the Malice was taken to the kitchen to live there, and a dog happier than one could imagine. One day, about two weeks after his arrival in the house to live there, a letter came from Milwaukee telling him that he should also be sent. And of course, the Malice knew it. How could he help him, when the whole house was so sorry to have sent him away? And that's why he began to prepare for the long journey that he was so early to take. While he was sitting near the litter, obviously trying to get an idea of what he had to take with him, his first thought was of the old coat that he had as a bed; he crossed the room, took the coat in his mouth, and with his legs, he scratched him in a package."
"Willie was a very small child and lived by a mill. One day, he saw a cruel big boy come and throw a little puppy into the powder bowl, and then run away. Willie cried, ""O Dad, Dad, come here!"" ""What's going on?"" said his dad. ""Oh, Dad! I want the little dog! Please take it for me. He will be drowned!"" His dad took a long pole and put it under the neck of the puppy and pulled it out of the water and gave it to Willie. He was very happy with his dog, who next year became a big, strong, shggy, and his name was Diver. He went everywhere with Willie the boy, and he loved Willie very much. Everyone said, ""What a beautiful dog!"" and Willie was proud of him."
"Hans stopped snoring and woke up at supper time. He looked for Cowslip, but she had disappeared; he ran to call him, but she did not come; and finally he returned to his mother with a very sad face and said, ""Oh, mother, Cowslip runs away while I was sleeping. I looked for her and I can't find her anywhere."" ""You are lazy, reckless, mean, mean, lazy!"" cried Mrs Stockchen. You let my poor cow wander by herself. She will lose her way in the dark. Just you will find her today. You won't have to have dinner until you bring her back, or my name is not Matilda Maria!"""
"The woman looked at the bag and said to herself, ""Now I wonder what this old boy carried so carefully? It will not hurt to see."" Then she untied the string and opened the bag and the ox jumped and ran into the courtyard, and the little boy who played it hunted him on the hill and in the wood. When the fox returned, he saw that the string had been untied, and he said to the old woman, ""Where is my ox?"" ""I opened the bag the least little bit, and the ox jumped and the little boy chased him on the hill and in the wood,"" said the old woman. ""May I take the little boy,"" said the fox. ""He gathered him up and put him in the bag and tied him up, I threw him on his shoulder and threw him on the road. When he came to the next house, he struck at the door and said, ""Hello, good mother. The way is long and I am tired. Can I leave my bag while I go to the store?"""
"Oeyvind's name was Oeyvind. On that roof, he walked around a little goat belonging to Oeyvind. He was kept there so that he would not go astray, and Oeyvind carried leaves and grass to him. On a fine day the goat leaped, and, far from the cliff, went up straight, and came where he had never been before. Oeyvind did not see him when he went out after dinner, and he immediately thought of the fox. He warmed up all the way around, looked around, and called, ""Killy-tuy-tu-goat."" ""Bay-ay-ay,"" said the goat, from the front of the hill, as he kissed his head on one side and looked down; but at the side of the goat, a little girl had kneeled down."
"The children were still laughing, and Mollie said: ""Poor Mrs. Tomkins, I was looking for a new house if I were you, you have such terrible neighbors! Then she took the chicken away, and Mrs. Tomkins picked up one of the kittens. ""Ms. Tomkins gave a sharp m-i-e-o-u, as if to say, ""What do you think about that?"" The mother of the children was sitting in the library reading when the old cat entered, with a kitten in her mouth. She put it gently, went out, and soon came back with another. She continued to do this until she moved her whole family of five kittens. Then she settled in a cozy corner, and looked at the lady, and purée this way: ""If you only knew how many problems I had with that old chicken, you would let me and my children stay here."" The lady laughed and said: ""I'm going to see what I can do for you."
"Ned helped him to harass Rover like a horse, and Jack went up and took the reins. ""Arise!"" said Jack, and they went into the yard and on a big field. But just then a little rabbit started in front of them, and the minute Rover saw, he started running after the rabbit. Poor Jack couldn't hold him at all. Round and round they went, and they ran, and they ran, and they shouted, ""Whoa, Rover! Stop, Rover!"" But Rover didn't stop. He wanted to catch the rabbit and he forgot Jack. Finally the rabbit ran to a hole under the wall, where Rover couldn't get it. But Rover ignited after him as fast as he could go. ""Bumpity-bump"" went the little wagon, and just as Rover missed the rabbit, the wheel hit a big stone and poor Jack jumped on the ground. But he didn't cry."
"Polly had often had his picture taken, but it was always with her father or mother, and she had never had her photo taken with her pets. Thus, Brother Ned had promised that on his birthday he would take her with all his pets, if they kept her only quietly. That day was Polly's birthday, and, as the weather was beautiful, her brother had told her to follow him to the orchard. Ned tied her camera on her three scattered legs, while Polly was trying to gather her pets around her. But at that time, Blackie, the cat, was chasing a squirrel (although he did not catch her), and Banty, the chicken, was far from scratching her worms; and Gyp, the dog, was barking at an authoritarian calf near the creek, because, of course, Polly's animals did not know that it was her birthday and that they had to take their pictures with her."
"Dad didn't say another word, but he couldn't help but think that the hole looked like the iron spoon had pricked him. The next morning, he found the hole dug there again, and Chuckie Wuckie was still busy in his corner near the fence. He didn't talk about it, however. There were small footprints on the edge. He didn't smooth the earth and shaved the bed. He did it for three mornings, then he drove Chuckie Wuckie back to the canna bed. ""Dad,"" she said seriously, ""I wasn't digging there. I really didn't do it. The hole is there every morning. I found it today before you go out, but I didn't dig it."" There were tears in her brown eyes. ""I believe you, dear Chuckie Wuckie,"" said her father, seriously."
"In fact, the fresh paint had such an intelligent appearance that a little girl who passed by the beach stopped and looked at it with admiration. 'Look, Dad,' she called her father. 'Is it not a dear little boat? Can we have it to go in a row?' 'It certainly seems wide enough and safe for a little girl who finds it difficult to stand still,' was the answer, and the result was an arrangement to rent the boat at regular intervals for the rest of the summer season. And when Mary Jane was set up for the winter, Jack and her grandfather counted their earnings, and found that enough had been earned to make the money requested for a new boat. 'This coat of paint was worth something after all,' said the old man."
"Hugh Martin had returned from Canada, where his father owned a ranch, on a visit to some British relations. Willie Pearse was the closest cousin to him in his age, and the two boys became great friends. ""It must be a happy life there, and the money seems to be done much faster than in England,"" Willie said one day. ""I wish Father would let me go out with you."" ""You should decide to work harder than you do here,"" Hugh told him, because he had noticed that his cousin was inclined to be lazy. ""Oh, I like that! Why, you told me how much there was nothing to do in winter, with everything frozen! I thought that when you had no time for sledge and sledge, you just sat by the fire and read."" ""Compared with summer, of course, winter work is nothing."
"When the ambassadors were back in Rome, the Senate ordered that there should be two armies, and Minucius the Consul marched with one against the Æquians on Mount Ægidus, and the other prevented the enemy from attacking them. This collection of the Tribunes of the Communes sought to obstruct; and the perchance had done so, but there also came a great army of the Sabines near the walls of the city plundering the whole country. There, the people willingly offered themselves, and two great armies were immediately taken away. Nevertheless, when the Consul Minucius had walked on Mount Ægidus, and had set up his camp not far from the Æquians, he was not afraid of the enemy, but kept himself in his bowels. And when the enemy realized that he was afraid, pushing the daring for his lack of courage, they drew lines around him, keeping him from all sides."
"The ten tables were therefore drawn up, and when they had been sufficiently taken into account, and the corrections made therein, as it seemed good, they called a regular assembly of the people, and the laws were duly established. But now a report was spread abroad, indicating that two tables were still in need, and that when they were to be added, all would be complete; and from there came a desire that the ten should be appointed to hold their office for a second year. This was done; but Appius Claudius therefore commanded things that there were none of the heads of state elected with him, but only as they were of a inferior condition and of fortune. After this the ten began more and more to set aside every law and right. Thus, on the first day only, the twelve leagues followed the twelve leagues, each of the ten came every day in the market so frequented, and while, before the leagues carried bundles of stems, now he had bound there with the rods an axe; which meant the power of life and death."
"One day, as usual, Midas enjoyed himself in his treasure chamber, when he saw a shadow falling on the piles of gold; and, looking up suddenly, what was he to see, but the figure of a stranger, standing in the ray of bright and narrow sun! He was a young man, with a cheerful and rough face. Whether it was that King Midas' imagination was throwing a yellow hue on everything, or whatever the cause might be, he could not help imagine that the smile with which the stranger considered him had a kind of golden glow in it. Certainly, although his figure intercepted the sun, there was now a brighter glow on all the piled treasures than before. Even the most remote corners had the share, and were illuminated, when the stranger smiled, as with flames and sparks of fire."
"The child promised to be as careful as if she were an adult woman, and at the time when the winged dragons had swept the car out of sight, she was already on the shore, calling the sea nymphs to come and play with her. They knew Proserpina's voice, and were not long in showing their bright faces and the green hair of the sea above the water, at the bottom of which was their house. They brought with them many beautiful shells; and, sitting on the wet sand, where the surf wave broke on them, they took care to make a necklace, which they hung around Proserpina's neck. As proof of gratitude, the child begged them to go with her a little way into the fields, so that they could gather abundance of flowers, with which she would make each of her friends a crown."
"But the triumph of Phoebus Apollo himself was not so wonderful as the triumph of a mortal man who lived on earth, although some say that he came from a divine lineage. It was Orpheus, the best of the harpists, who went with the Greek heroes of the great Argo ship in search of the Golden Fairy. After his return from the quest, he won Eurydice for his wife, and they were as happy as people can be who love each other and all the others. The wild beasts loved them, and the trees gathered around their house as if they were drunk with music. But even the gods themselves were not always free of pain, and one day the misfortune came upon this harpist Orpheus whom all men loved to honor."
"On the tower above the door of Scæan, she found the elders of Troy. These, because of their age, had ceased the war, but were still good speakers, with voices like locusts sitting on a tree, and sending their voices like lilies; so sat the elders of the Troyans on the tower. When these ancient wise men saw the beautiful Helen coming to them, they were astonished, and whispered to each other, ""No wonder that the Trojans and the Achaeans had suffered so much for such a glorious woman! But just as she is, let her flee, and do not stand here to trouble us and our children after us."" But the old King Priam spoke to her kindly. ""Dear daughter, come here, and see your former husband and your parents! I do not blame you, but the Gods, and especially Venus, by whom this sad war was brought upon us."
"First of all, he made the shield, wide and strong, with many decorations. Around him, he placed a triple and brilliant rim, and a silver strap depended on it. The shield itself was formed of five zones, in each of which he formed many curious works. There, he shaped the Earth, Heaven, the Sea, the Untiring Sun, the Full Moon, and all the shining lights that crown the firmament of Azure: the Pleiades, the daughters of Atlas, the Hyades, the mighty Orion, and, turning towards the Orion, the Bear, which alone of all the stars bathe in the streams of Oceanus. On the shield, he carved two beautiful cities of articulating men. In one of them were wedding feasts; and, with a torch of torch, the brides were led from their chambers along the streets; while the hymney's song was strong, and the young were weeping in the dance, and the women were weeping at the flute; and the women were weeping at the music."
"The Sea-kings knew this port, rowed directly into it, and ran their ship a half-tail to the ground. Then they lifted up Ulysses from the stern, wrapped the carpets and the roofer, and slept on the sand again. And the gifts which they placed in a heap near the trunk of the olive tree, a little off the road, so that no passerby could steal it while he was asleep. Then they sailed; and after they were gone, Ulysses woke up, but he could not know the land where he lay, for Athena had cast a mist upon him, so that everything seemed strange, though he was the master of everything. There were mountain paths and the streams sheltering, the high rocks, the steep rocks and the trees in bloom; but he could not see it right, and he began and struck his hands on his thighs and shouted with high voice, — What land am I coming now? What can I do with all this treasure?"
"He said to him that he was an Ithaca, his name Achaemenides, and that he had been one of Ulysses' companions in his wanderings. He recounted the adventures of the Hero Ithaca in the cave of Polyphemus, and said that he himself, having been left by accident behind when his comrades had escaped, had since led a miserable existence in the woods, living on wild berries and roots, and continually in fear that he would be seen by the Cyclops. He advised Æneas not to waste time leaving the country, lest the ferocious shepherds discover them and destroy them."
"The next competition was that, with the cestus, the boxing-bra of the elders, a formidable instrument, was intended not to soften the blows of the boxers, but to make them more painful, because it was composed of bands of hardened beef. For the competitors of this sport, if it could be called – Æneas offered two prizes, - the first a bull, filled with gold and nets, and the second a sword and a brilliant helmet. A well-known Trojan warrior named Dares, a man of immense strength and bulk, who was also celebrated for his talent with the cestus, presented himself to contest this prize. He brandished his big fists in the air, and flew in vain gloriously back and forth in the arena, defying anyone in the assembly to meet him. But there was no answer; his friends were too well aware of his talent, and the Sicilians were stunned by his formidable appearance."
"They soon found that the princess was missing, and in a moment the palace was like a hive in a garden; and in a minute the queen was brought to herself by a great cry and a clap of hands. They found the princess asleep under a bush rose, to which the little elfish wind had worn her, finishing her malice by shaking a shower of red rose leaves all over the little white dormer. Surprised by the noise that the servants made, she woke up, and, furious with gluttony, dispersed the rose leaves in all directions, like a spray shower in the sunset. She was looked at more carefully after that, no doubt; but it would never end up telling all the strange incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess. But there was never a baby in a house, without a palace, who kept the house in such a constant mood, at least under the stairs."
"""I could tell you my adventures, starting this morning,"" Alice said a little shyly; ""but it's not useful to go back to yesterday, because I was then a different person."" ""Explain all this,"" said the Mock turtle. ""No, no! adventures first,"" said the Gryphon in an impatient tone; ""explanations take so long."" Alice began to tell them about her adventures as soon as she saw the white rabbit; she was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures approached her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so big, but she gained courage as she went."
"""Well, it's great!"" said Alice. ""I never expected me to be a queen so fast – and I'm going to tell you what it is, your majesty,"" she continued in a harsh tone (she always liked to scold herself), ""it will never do for you to be on the grass like that! Queens must be worthy, you know!"" Then she rose up and walked rather firmly at the beginning, for she feared that the crown would come off: but she comforted herself with the thought that there was no one to see it; ""and if I am truly a queen,"" she said, as she sat again, ""I will be able to manage it well enough in time."" Everything was so strange that she didn't feel a little surprised to find the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting next to her, one on either side: she would have liked to ask them how they came, but she feared it was not very civil."
"We returned to our castle, and there I fell to work for my man on Friday; and first I gave him a pair of drawers in linen, which I had from the chest of the poor gunner whom I mentioned, which I found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, was very well suited; then I gave him a stretcher of goat's skin, as my skill would allow, and I had now become a good tolerable tailor; and I gave him a hat that I had made of the skin of a hare, very practical, and quite fashionable; and so he was dressed, for the moment, tolerably well; and he was very happy to see himself almost as well dressed as his master."
"I cried out, ""Arise, and the word went like a dagger to me; but seeing the terror of my children renewed, I composed myself joyfully crying, ""Keep up, my boys! We are all still above the water. There is the earth that is not far away; let us do our best to reach it. You know that God helps those who help us!"" With this I left them and went on deck. What was my horror when, through the foam and spray, I looked at the only ship that remained out of the ship, the last of the sailors rushed towards it and pushed it, regardless of my screams and my torments, so that we could share their slim chance of preserving their lives. My voice was drowned in the scream of the explosion; and even if the crew wished, the return of the boat was impossible."
"I remembered that I had often heard of a miraculous bird called the rock, and I conceived that the great dome that I admired so much should be his egg. In short, the bird lit up, and sat above the egg. As I saw it coming, I cramped myself by the egg, so that I had in front of me one of the bird's legs, which was as tall as the trunk of a tree. I strongly attached myself to it with my turban, in the hope that the rock the next day would carry me with it out of that deserted island. After spending the night in this condition, the bird flew as soon as it was in broad daylight, and carried me so high that I could no longer discern the earth; it descended so quickly that I lost my senses."
"The next night Grendel returned and obtained his second tribute, and again there was mourning and desolation in the land. Thus, for twelve years, the giant monster came at regular intervals and carried many nobles into the kingdom. Then there were empty houses everywhere in the land, and sorrow and suffering came where joy and peace had rested. As strange as it may appear, Hrothgar himself was never touched, although he was sitting at night, looking at his nobles as they slept in the emergency room, hoping himself to deliver them from the terrible power that harassed them."
"Once upon a time, in a distant land where no one knows the exact place, lived a king whose glory and pride in chief were in her three beautiful daughters. The two older sisters were sought in marriage by the princes, but Psyche, by far the most beautiful of the three, remained at her father's house, unfinished. The fact was, she was so beautiful that all the people worshiped her as a goddess, while no one felt that he was worthy to ask for his hand. ""Is it a mere mortal, it is said, to seek the love of Venus, queen of beauty? When Psyche learned the name they had given her, she was afraid, for she knew well the jealous and vengeful nature of the goddess of beauty. And she did well to fear; for Venus, jealous, angry, even then plotted her destruction."
"From the same dwarf, he feared a magical coat or a tarnkappe, which gave his owner a wonderful strength, proved to him at all times, and allowed him to become invisible. Finally, when the other nobles had sworn allegiance to him, Siegfried fled, lord of the land and treasure of Nibelunger. At that time, he lived in Burgundy, on the Rhine, a young princess of such rare virtue and beauty that the noble young people had come from all countries to win her as a wife. However, she had not granted his favor to anyone. What, then, was the surprise and anticipation felt by King Siegmund and his queen, Siegelind, the parents of Siegfried, when he informed them that he was about to go to Burgundy, to pursue for the hand of Princess Kriemhild. For they knew that King Gunther, Kriemhild's brother, was a man of great power, and that he and his nobles were able to look down on Sied."
"In fact, when he was only eight months old, his mother discovered that he wanted ""nothing like singing and dancing."" Then, he also liked to play ball, swimming, rib and skating, and all other ordinary games and sports. However, he was a particularly attentive boy, and even from his early years was a very conscientious student and prided himself on making a good record at school. During the years spent at the Portland Academy, where he was placed at six years old, he worked so intensely and with such excellent results that, although he found it very difficult – indeed too difficult – to be perfect in deportation, his serious efforts were recognized by the schoolmaster who returned to the house from time to time a note or a short statement in which Henry's recitations and general conduct were highly praised."
"The sisters decided from the first to have a house; they had a horror of the atmosphere of the boarding house. Their first house was only two, or three bedrooms, high in a large building in an indefatigable part of the city. Alice paper rooms, Phoebe painted doors and framed images; but the impression of their individuality was on the rooms, and each person who entered them felt their cozyness and ""homie."" Newspapers and magazines paid little for contributions at that time, and it was only by living in the most economical and humble way that they managed to avoid their great horror — debt. But their life was by no means sterile, because they became acquainted with many pleasant people, who were always happy and proud to be invited to the small evenings of tea in the three rooms under the roof."
"At the age of eight or nine, her mother led her children to live for some time on property belonging to her family on the shore of Sebago Lake in Maine. Then she began a period of great pleasure for the young boy and her sisters. Since the land was mainly covered with wood and the colonies were very far away, there were endless possibilities of fishing and hunting and roaming in the woods or spending long uninterrupted hours with the favorite authors. In winter Nathaniel spent a lot of time skating on Sebago Lake, feeling completely free and at home in the midst of nature's wildlife."
"When Joanna appeared, he had been about to give up the struggle with the English, afflicted as they were, and to fly south of France. She taught her to blush for such abject advice. She liberated Orléans, this great city, so decisive by her destiny for the question of war, then swallowed up by the English with an elaborate application of engineering unprecedented in Europe. Upon entering the city after sunset on April 29, she sang Mass on Sunday, May 8, for all the disappearance of the besieged force. On June 29, she fought and acquired the decisive battle of Patay over the English; on July 9, she took Troyes by a hand of a mixed garrison of English and Burgundy; on the 15th of that month, she carried the dolphin to Rheims; on Sunday, 17, she crowned him; and there she rested herself from her work of triumph."
"This great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine battles with the Danes. He also made treaties with them, by which the false Danes swore that they would leave the land. They claimed to consider that they had taken a very solemn oath on the sacred bracelets they were wearing, and that they were still buried with them when they died; but they paid little attention to this, for they thought nothing of breaking the oaths, and treated them also, as soon as they were fit for their purpose, and that they would come back to fight, loot, and burn, as usual. A fatal winter, in the fourth year of King Alfred's reign, they spread in great numbers throughout England; and so scattered and directed the king's soldiers that the king was left alone, and forced to disguise himself as a common peasant, and to take refuge in the house of one of his vachers who did not know his face."
"We found ourselves in a large courtyard paved with white marble and decorated at each end with light Moorish peristyles. It is called the courtyard of the Alberca. In the center was a huge basin, or fish pool, of a length of one hundred and thirty feet by thirty width, garnished with gold fish, and lined with hedges of roses. At the upper end of this courtyard was the great tower of Comares. From the lower end, we wandered through a Moorish arch in the famous courtyard of the Lions. There is not a part of the building that gives us a more complete idea of its beauty and its original magnificence; for no one has suffered so little from the ravages of time. In the center is the famous fountain in song and history. The alabaster basins have yet poured their diamond drops, and the twelve lions that support them in their crystal streams as in the days of Boabdil."
"But the sting certainly does not exhaust the whole philosophy of nettle. Look, for example, at the stem and the leaves. The nettle has found its chance in life, its only suitable vacation, among the ditches and places of waste by the roads or by the cottages; and it has risen up for the circumstances in which it lives. Its close relative, the hops, is a torrid climber; its cousins from the south, the figs and the mulberry, are large and extended trees. But the nettle has made a niche in nature along the bare plots that diversify the human culture; and it has adapted its stem and the leaves to the station in the life where it pleased Providence to place it."
"Where the travelers looked, a new creation seemed to flourish. No sign of human frenzy appeared to check out the delicious wild nature of Nature, which here revealed itself in all its lush variety. These hills, now drunk, like the frenetic porcupine, with rows of poplars (to the top of the plants! minions of wealth and fashion!), were then decorated with the vigorous natives of the ground — bold oak, generous chestnut, graceful elm — while there and there the tulipier raised his majestic head, the giant of the forest. Where now we see the luxury gay retreats — half buried in twilight arches, hence the bitter flute often breathes the sighs of a certain city — there, the fish-hawk built his solitary nest on a dry tree that neglected his aquatic domain."
"The next morning he reached Portsmouth; and having left his affairs on the shore, he tried to escape from the people by taking the way to the beach; but a crowd gathered in his train, pushing forward to obtain a view of his face;—many were in tears, and many kneeled before him, and blessed him as he passed. England had many heroes, but never one who possessed so completely the love of his compatriots as Nelson. All men knew that his heart was as human as he was without fear; that there was not in its nature any alloy of selfishness or greed; but that, with perfect and complete devotion, he served his country with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength; and therefore, they loved him as sincerely and fervently as he loved England."
"Young people are likely to think that the study is laborious and without interest, nuisance and boredom. Nothing of this kind is true of Shakespeare's study, because for all efforts there is a present reward, there is no waiting to see results. Of course, there are good ways and bad ways to study, just as there are good ways and bad ways to do anything. Sometimes teachers do not fully care about their classes in Shakespeare, and parents say they can't make their children like Shakespeare. None of this is the fault of the poet or children; the fault lies in the methods used to create an interest."
"The little living sprite Ariel had nothing malicious in his nature, except that he took too much pleasure in tormenting a terrible monster called Caliban, for he owed him a grudge because he was the son of his former enemy Sycorax. This Caliban, Prospero, found in the woods, a strange dishonest thing, far less human than a monkey: he brought him home to his cell, and taught him to speak; and Prospero would have been very kind to him, but the bad nature that Caliban inherited from his mother Sycorax, did not allow him to learn anything good or useful: he was therefore employed as a slave, to go and get wood, and do the most laborious functions; and Ariel was in charge of forcing him to perform these services."
"If this is the case, what more important work can be for the father than to read with his son, to look at the beginnings of education that mean so much more than just instruction at school, and to be a power in the development of this good method of reading which means not only the acquisition of knowledge, but also the acquisition of power and the manufacture of character. The busy man is tired at night and inclined to think that he does not have time to give to read with his boys. He may also think that reading childish stories is under his dignity. This is not the case. There is a great abundance of literature that is virile, and at the same time interesting for a boy."
"Although it is generally preferable to allow each person to learn the lines that attract him most, it is necessary to give help to the children. There will not be two people who will choose all the same things, even if all would probably agree on some things as being of the highest excellence. Some lines should be learned because of their beauty in the description, others because of the beauty in the phraseology, and others because of the beauty in the feeling. Also, research is needed for things that are inspiring, and that will be strong aids in the construction of the character. We add a few pages of quotes taken at random in the volumes. They will prove useful when the parent or teacher is in a hurry for time, and references to the volume and page will allow the busy person to easily find the context, if this seems desirable. The quotations below are organized in the order of their appearance in Journeys Through Bookland. This will allow anyone to easily locate them."
"You can lead a child to read Rab and his friends for all the purposes that we have suggested, and yet he may have passed over them without much understanding them a word, a sentence or even a sentence. It is possible that there are entire paragraphs that give him little meaning. It is certainly not an evil without mixing, because it is good that a child should not exhaust the possibilities of such a masterpiece when he reads it for the first time. In fact, it is good for children to often read large publications even when much of this is far beyond their understanding. He will prick their curiosity, and some time they will come back with more wisdom and experience to interpret for themselves the things that were once obscure. It is not a sin for a child to sometimes pass a word that he cannot pronounce or understand. There may be some other ways to destroy his taste for reading than asking him to stop and find the meaning of every new word he encounters."
"The words alone are not sufficient possession. They must be known in all their relationships. An understanding of the structure of the sentence is always necessary. A sentence is a unit of thought, an idea reduced to its lowest terms. It may not be necessary for each sentence to be strictly analyzed by grammatical rules, but it is essential that the reader recognize by study, if necessary, the subject and the predicate as well as the character and rank of all the modifiers of each. Even the reader practiced by unconsciously assigning excessive importance to a minor sentence frequently modifies the meaning that an author intends to transmit. This is particularly true in the verse, where the poet, tainted by the rules governing his meter and rhyme, varies the natural order of the elements of a sentence to bring the accents where they belong or to throw the word rhyming at the end of a verse. The grouping of related phrases into paragraphs is a help to the reader and must be noticed by him until he usually waits for a slight change of thought with the identification of a line becomes fixed and automatic."
"Literature has something for every hour, every mood, every circumstance. There may be a small vacant chair in this family circle, or a child's family has gone. Fear clings to the heart of youth and grief trembles behind each chair. Even the warm bed in the dark room is a fear, for we have so surrounded the death of mystery and terror that even young people are afflicted when it is mentioned. But our beloved poet has a message of encouragement for everyone, and in this small group the parent brings it. Soft and friendly voices he reads aloud, giving the slow and gentle music of the time lines to fly in the heart of youth."
"With the exception of his lame, he developed so well and strong that at about the age of eight, he was placed with his brothers in the upper class of Edinburgh High School, known as High School. Although he had a few lessons in Latin with a private tutor, he was behind his class in this subject, and being a high mood and sensitive boy, he felt this disadvantage quite strongly. Perhaps the fact that he could not be one of the leaders of his class made him negligent; in any case, he could never depend on him to prepare his lesson, and at no time did he make a good record. However, he did not find a little comfort for his failure as a student in his popularity as a storyteller and friendly friend."
"At the age of thirteen, he was at work in New York, and soon was discovered to be the secret editor of a newspaper called The Thespian Mirror. The merit of this juvenile paper attracted the attention of many people, and among them, Mr. Seaman, a wealthy New Yorker who offered the talented boy the opportunity to go to university at no cost. Young Payne gladly accepted the invitation, and proceeded to Union College, where he quickly became one of the most popular boys in school. His beautiful face, graceful manners and elegant delivery were greeted with applause every time he spoke in public, and a natural taste led him to look for every chance of declamation and action. Even as a child, he showed his dramatic ability, and more than once he was urged to go on stage."
"His first days were therefore very happy; but when he was about eleven years old, financial difficulties took over the family, and they were obliged to settle in a poor part of London. Mrs. Dickens made constant efforts to open a school for girls, but no one ever showed any intention to come. Things went from bad to worse, and finally Mr. Dickens was arrested for debt and taken to Marshalsea prison. The time that followed was a very painful time for the sensitive boy – much more painful, it would seem, that, as Dickens later called him. This father, whom Dickens described long after, in David Copperfield, like Mr. Micawber, was, like his son was always most willing to testify, a kind and generous man; but he was improvising to the last degree; and when in difficulties that would have made any other man melancholy, he was able, by the strength of his rhetoric alone, to rise above the circumstances or to make himself happy in them."
"While I was calling the brig, I spied on a tract of water that lay between us, where there were no great waves, but which, while boiling the white throughout the moon, shone with rings and bubbles. Sometimes the whole leaflet turned on one side, like the tail of a living snake; sometimes, to get a glimpse, everything disappeared and then boiled again. What I had not guessed, which, for the moment, increased my fear; but now I know that it was the rock or the tide that had taken me so quickly and struck me so cruelly, and finally, as if he were tired of this room, had thrown me and the rescue court on his land margin."
"He drew things to him with a stick, and even used a swing for the same purpose. He had been put up for the children, and could be reached by Mickey, who now and then was engaged with a swing on her. One day, I had put bird skins on a chair to dry, far beyond, as I thought, Mickey's reach; but, fertile in the expeditions, he took the swing and threw it towards the chair, and in fact managed to cut down the skins in the return of the swing, in order to bring them to his reach. He also bought a jelly that was put to cool in the same way. Mickey's actions were very human like. When someone came near to caresss him, he never neglected the opportunity to steal pockets. He took out letters, and quickly took them out of their envelopes. Every eatable disappeared immediately in his mouth."
"In Kate, however, I had a firm friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me very gently that I could have her (plum and everything) every time I could smear my great uncle, Rumgudgeon, in the necessary consent. Poor girl! she was barely fifteen years old, and without that consent, her small amount in the funds was not com-at-able until five immeasurable summers had ""draged their slow length."" What then? In vain, we besieged the old gentleman with importunities. He would have aroused Job's indignation himself to see how much he behaved to us as an old mouse. In his heart, he wanted nothing more ardently than our union."
"My father once went to the country, in the idle season, seeing if he could make a cent at all by cutting his hair, putting eruptions or penkives, or any other work that would fall in his way. Welt an' good — he was one day walking in the Kerry mountains, without ha'p'ny in his pocket (for though he had traveled a foot, he cost him more than he had earned), one' knowing that there was little love for a man from Limerick County where he was, a 'half-dead with hunger, a drawing of the evening near, he didn't know what to do with himself until the morning. Very good—he went along the wild road; one' if he did, he soon saw a farm a little distance from one side, a snob place, with smoke rolling out of the fireplace, all signs of good life inside. Well, some would go hungry."
"Hawkeye went away from the gaze, and descended deeply to the shore. He communicated the result of his observations to his companions at Delaware, and a short and serious consultation came to pass. When it ended, the three immediately began to execute their new resolutions. The canoe was lifted up from the water, and carried on the party's shoulders. They went into the woods, making as wide and obvious a path as possible. They soon arrived at a stream, which they passed through, and continued until they arrived at a vast and bare rock. At this point, where their steps would no longer be visible, they traced their way back to the stream, walking back with the greatest care. They now followed the bed of the little stream to the lake, in which they immediately threw their canoe. A low point concealed them from the promontory, and the margin of the lake was fringed for a certain distance with dense and overhanging bushes. Under the cover of these natural advantages, they began to believe that the industry had grown patiently."
"Four days on the Platte, and yet no buffalo! Last year's signs were abundantly provocative; and the wood being extremely rare, we found an admirable substitute in cowwood, which burns exactly like peat, not producing unpleasant effects. The wagons one morning had left the camp; Shaw and I were already on horseback, but Henry Chatillon was still sitting by the dead embers of the fire, playing pensively with the lock of his rifle, while his solid Wyandotte pony stood quietly behind him, looking at his head. Finally, he stood up, pawed the neck of the pony (who, with an exaggerated appreciation of his merits, had named ""five hundred dollars""), and then mounted with a melancholic air. ""What is it, Henry?"""
"On the twenty-eighth of June, 1838, after having been queen for more than a year, Victoria was officially crowned at Westminster Abbey. The crown worn by her predecessors was far too large for her, so that a new crown was made at a price of more than five hundred thousand dollars. The spectacle was a very impressive and inspiring spectacle, and the queen passed on her part, as she had done at all the ceremonies in which she had participated, in a way that awakened the enthusiasm of her subjects. When the Prime Minister finally placed the crown on Victoria's head, all the peers and peeresses placed their coronets on her head and shouted God Saved the Queen. Carlyle said of her at that time, ""Poor little Queen! She is at an age when one can no longer have confidence in choosing a hat for herself, but a task is laid on her, and an archangel could retract herself."""
"As soon as the little boy had eaten all the food that his sister had left him, he went out into the woods, picked up berries, and dug roots, and the sun burned and filled up. But when the snow began and the wind screamed, his stomach felt empty and his limbs cold, and he hid himself in the trees all night long, and threw himself only to eat what the wolves had left behind them. And, having no other friends, he sought their company, and sat down while they devoured their prey, and they knew him and gave him food. And without them, he died in the snow. But finally, the snow melted and the ice on the great lake, and the wolves went down to the shore, and the boy went after them. And it came to pass one day that his big brother was fishing in his canoe by the shore, and he heard the voice of a child singing in the Indian tone: ""My brother, my brother! I become a wolf, I become a wolf!"""
"When they returned, their mother, who had been watching over them all night with her bright little eye, said, ""Well, children, what did you bring home for me?"" So Sun (who was the eldest) said, ""I didn't bring home anything for you. I went out to have fun with my friends - not to go and eat for my mother!"" And Wind said, ""Did I bring nothing to the house for you, Mom. You couldn't wait for me to bring a collection of good things for you, when I went out for my pleasure. But Moon said, ""Mother, go get a plate, see what I brought you."" And shaking her hands she ate a dinner of choice like never before."
"I am not an idiot. I speak of what I saw with my own eyes, and I heard him with my own ears. ""Going to the strange, I will inquire."" The next day the king repeated to his vizir what his wife had said to him, and told him to investigate the question, and to be prepared with a satisfactory answer in six mouths, on the pain of death. The vizier promised to do his best, although he was almost certain of the failure. For months of life he worked tirelessly to find a reason for the laughter of the fish. He sought everywhere and all. The wise and learned, and those who were skilled in magic and all sorts of tricks, were consulted. No one, however, could explain the question; and so he returned to the broken heart in his house, and began to arrange his affairs for death, for he had had enough experience of the king to know that His Majesty would not return from his threat."
"Then the farmer told the whole story, and Rain, taking pity on him, gave him a shell of conch, and showed him how to blow it up in a particular way, saying, ""Remember! Whatever you want, you only have to blow the conch in this way, and your desire will be fulfilled. Only, take care of this lender of money, for even magic is not proof against their tricks!"" The farmer returned to his village and rejoiced. In fact, the money lender immediately noticed his high spirits, and said, ""Good fortune must have come to the idiot, to make him hold his head so jealously."""
"One day he met a friend and told him all his difficulties. The friend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think about the question, and to call him a little and tell him what to do. He did it; in a few days he visited the old man and put four bags full of stones and gravel in front of him. ""Look here, friend,"" he said. ""Your sons will learn to know my coming today, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I have come to pay you a long debt, and that you are several thousand richer rupees than you thought. Keep these bags in your hands, and never let your sons get them as long as you are alive. You will soon find them changing their conduct towards you. Salaam, I will soon come back to see how you are doing."" When the young men heard this new increase in wealth, they began to be more attentive and pleasant to their father than ever before."
"Once upon a time a Tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through bars, and rolled and bited with rage and sorrow when he failed. By chance a poor Brahman came. ""Let me out of this cage, oh godly!"" cried the Tiger. ""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman gently, ""you would probably eat me if I did."" ""Not at all!"" swore the Tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should always be grateful, and serve you forever!"" Now, when the Tiger wept, wept, and swore, the heart of the pious Brahman eased, and finally he consented to open the door of the cage."
"The cow-herds dropped the stop of the buffalo and began to bind him to the tail of the little animal. ""No!"" he called, with great haste. ""If the beast would shoot, the skin of my tail would come, and then where should I be? Tie him around my neck, if you will."" So, with a lot of laugh the cow-herds tied the stop around the neck of the rat, and he, after a polite hold, moved cheerfully towards the house with its price; that is, he went away with the rope, for no sooner came he at the end of the tether than to be raised with a round turn; the bison, the nose down, grazing, did not move until he had finished his tuft of grass, and then saw another different direction walking towards it, while the rat, to avoid being dragged, had to humbly trotter behind, Willy-nilly. He was too proud to confess the truth, much more confident, and much more confident to say to his head, much more confidently said to himself, that his head, was to confessing the truth, well, much more confident, and much more confidently to his head, and to say to his head, to his own head."
"""You are satisfied now?"" asked the Partridge. ""Well,"" replied the Jackal, ""I confess that you have given me a very good dinner; you have also made me laugh and weep! But after all, the great test of friendship is beyond you, you could not save my life!"" ""Perhaps not,"" he sadly acquiesced the Partridge, ""I am so small and weak. But he grows up late, we should go home; and as he is a long way around the ford, let's go through the river. My friend the Crocodile will transport us. Therefore they will leave for the river, and the Crocodile kindly consents to carry them through, and they sit on his wide back and tie them. But as they were in the middle of the stream, the Partridge made notice."
"""Did you see my horse?"" said the man. ""Yes,"" said the thief, ""I saw him eat your horse."" ""How could the tree eat my horse?"" said the man. ""Why did it do it,"" said the thief. ""The two went to a fox and told him about the case. ""The fox said. ""I am dull. All last night, the sea was on fire; I had to throw a lot of hay in to extinguish the flames; so tomorrow, and I'm going to hear your case. Oh, you lie,"" said the thief. ""How could the sea burn? How could the hay extinguish the flames?"" ""Oh, you lie,"" said the fox, laughing loudly; how could a tree eat a horse?"
"Two fools heard a drum sound, and said, ""There was one inside which made the noise."" So, seeing a moment when the drummer had come out, they saw a hole on each side of it, and they pushed their hands in it. Each one felt his hand inside the drum, and cried, ""I caught it!"" One said to the other, ""Brother, the man seems to be a stubborn wick; come what, we should not yield."" ""Not one inch, brother,"" said the other. They pulled their hand, thinking that it was the man in the drum. The drummer went up, and finding them in such an embarrassing situation showed them with his fist that the man in the drum was really. But as his beautiful drum was ruined, he said, with a sigh, ""Helas! the fools have fantasies with a triple wing!"""
"""Wait a moment, good friend,"" said the Worm, ""and you will hear something to your advantage."" ""Ah, what is it?"" said the Daw. ""I'm only one of the many bright worms that live in this forest. If you want to have them all, follow me,"" said the Worm. ""Certainly,"" said the Daw. ""Then the Worm led him to a place in the wood where a fire had been lit by loggers, and pointing towards the sparks flying around, said, ""You find there the bright worms warming up around a fire. When you're done with them, I'll show you a few more, away from that place."" The Daw turned on the sparks and tried to swallow some of them, but his mouth being burned by the attempt, he ran away screaming, ""Ah, the Worm is a little dangerous creature!"""
"They came into a garden, closed by a low wall, without opening. The camel stood on this side of the wall, and reached the plants inside by its long neck, and made a breakfast on them. Then he turned, laughing, towards the pig, who stood at the bottom of the wall, without even looking at the good things in the garden, and said, ""Now, would you be tall or short?"" Then they came to a garden, closed by a high wall, with a window door at one end. The pig entered through the door, and, after having eaten his filling of vegetables inside, went out, laughing at the poor camel, who had had to stay outside because he was too tall to enter the garden by the door, and said, ""Now, would you be tall or short? Then they thought the matter and came to the conclusion that the camel had to keep his bump and the pig his snout, observing: ""Everything is good, where great would do; shorter, it was true!"
"Paul did not yield, but he worked until the afternoon before thinking of taking food; then all at the same time he became hungry and opened his bag, but he could find only a crumb. Paul became so angry that he turned the bag inside and hit him against the stump of a tree; then lay down took his axe, came out of the forest, and went to the house. As soon as Paul came back, Ashiepattle wanted to leave and asked his mother for a bag of food. ""Maybe I can build the ship and win the princess and half the kingdom,"" he said. ""Well, I never heard the genre,"" said his mother. ""Are you likely to win the princess, you, who never do anything but root and dig into the ashes? No, you don't have a bag with food!"""
"""Wait a little,"" said the bear, who was furious. ""Don't worry, Grandpa; if you let me go, you will taste honey,"" said the fox. ""When the bear heard this, he let go his hand, and the fox jumped on the stone after honey. ""On this nest,"" said Reynard, ""I will put a leaf, and in the leaf there is a hole, by which you can suck honey. ""Then he put the nest right under the bear's nose, and drew the leaf, and jumped on the stone, and began to smile and laugh; for there was neither honey nor honey nest in the nest. It was a wasp nest as large as a man's head, full of wasps, and came out the bear in his eyes and his ears, and on his mouth and his snout. He had so much to do to scratch it that he didn't have to think of Reynard."""
"Then the bear had the spirit to learn to fish, too, and to tell the fox how to get there. ""Oh, it's an easy boat for you,"" replied the fox, ""and soon learnt. You only have to go on the ice, and cut a hole and stick your tail in it; and therefore you have to keep holding it there as long as you can. You're not in mind if your tail is a little smart; that's where the fish bites. The more you hold it there the more fish you get; and then all at once with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with a strong pull too."" Yes; the bear does as Fox had said, and holds its tail a long, down in the hole, until it is quickly frozen in."
"""I don't understand, Cousin, how you can handle food as poor as this one, but of course you can't expect something better in the country; come with me and I'll show you how to live. When you're in town for a week, you'll wonder how you could ever have had a country life."" No sooner said than done: the two mice left for the city and arrived at the Mouse's residence late in the night. ""You'll want refreshment after our long journey,"" said the Mouse of the polished city, and took her friend to the big dining room. There they found the remains of a beautiful feast, and soon the two mice ate jelly and cakes and everything that was pleasant. Suddenly, they heard groaning and barking. ""What is that?"" said the Mouse of the countryside."
"A man and his son once went with their Donkey to the market. As they were walking beside them, a peasant passed them and said, ""You fools, what is a Donkey to go around?"" Then the man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of them said, ""See this lazy young man, he lets his father walk while he rides."" Then the man ordered his Boy to go, and went on his own. But they had not gone far when they passed two women, one of them said to the other, ""Change on this lazy boy to let his poor little son go."" Well, the man did not know what to do, but finally he took his Boy before him on the Donkey."
"""Oh, father,"" said a little frog at the big sitting by a pool, ""I saw a monster as terrible! It was as big as a mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and he had hooves divided in two."" ""Tush, child, tush,"" said the old frog, ""it was only the Ox of Farmer White. ""It's not as big as that either; it can be a little bigger than me, but I could easily make myself as wide; just you see."" Then he got blown up, and blew himself out, and got blown out. ""Was he as big as that?"" he asked. ""Oh, much bigger than that,"" said the young frog. ""The old one blew up again, and asked the young man if the Ox was as big as that. ""Bigger, father, taller,"" was the answer."
"By the council of Merlin, Arthur sent for help overseas to Ban and Bors, the two great kings who ruled in Gaul. With their help, he overturned his enemies in a great battle near the Trent River; then he passed with them into their own land and helped them to drive out their enemies. Thus, there was always a great friendship between Arthur and the kings Ban and Bors, and all their families, and after that some of the most famous Knights of the Round Table were of this family. Then King Arthur began to restore order throughout his kingdom. To all who would submit and alter their evil ways, he showed kindness; but those who persisted in oppression and evil he took away, putting in their place others who would deal with the people with justice."
"When the coronation ceremonies were over, the life of little Isabella became a quiet routine of study; for, although she was sovereign, she was in the position of this young Duchess of Burgundy years later, who at the time of her marriage could not read or write. This duchess, who married a grandson of Louis XIV of France, was older than Queen Isabella—thirteen years; and as soon as the wedding festivities were over, she was sent to school in a convent, to learn at least to read, for she knew absolutely nothing but to dance. Queen Isabella, however, was not sent to school, but was placed under the care of a very accomplished lady, cousin of the king, who acted as her governess."
"We enter the cars and we are soon on Cannon Street. At the doors a boy meets us with little books for sale, shouting: ""Thirteen elephants for a penny! the other boys will only give you twelve, but I will give you thirteen. Sold again! Thirteen elephants for a penny!"" This wonderful book consists of a series of images of plainly common color, supposed to represent the procession, which has served the exhibition since time immemorial, but it is every year as welcome as ever to the children who each have a penny to buy one. In the streets we have visions of pink silk stockings, canary-coloured panties, dark green coats and gold laces, as tricolored roses as well as saucers; and pass through windows full of sweet and greedy small faces, instead of the pipe, shirts, sewing machines, etc. We finally arrive at our destination in Cheapside, where, through the kindness of a friend, a large window waiting for us on the first floor."
"Under the shadow of the willow, and from one of the branches, I had hung a miniature ""belfry"" containing a small brass bell, and I had led the rope into the water, letting it go down to a considerable depth. At first I had attached the bait at intervals on the line, and the stickies, of course, took hold of it, and thus rang the bell. Generally, the bells were very serious and appropriate, although sometimes, when the bait was too tight, the quick nuts sounded like a call to a fire. I generally fed them first, about twenty feet from the bank; but one morning, I found one or two following me to the residence of the spinach's family. However, they encountered a rough reception and, to avoid causing trouble, the next day I went to the willow first. But no sooner had the bell started to ring, which I saw many undulations coming down, and in a second the two factions were in mortal combat."
"""Here, sir! Please take this bird to Albro, and see how much it weighs."" The idea! What would people say on the way, to see the ""professor"" go out with a big turkey under his arm? It was the way that the thing presented itself to the good-aged student acting as a private guardian in the family. But Mrs Simpson, the portable and practical chambermaid, did not have such an idea of the fitness of things. It was the day before Thanksgiving, and the farmer who had agreed to provide him with a turkey had brought it, but had not weighed it, and, of course, they could not agree on his weight, all that ended in the surprising proposition with which we started."
"Now, dear fanciful workers, young and old, surely Santa Claus has provided you with enough ideas to take care of more Christmas than just one. Just one more thing, and that's the way the gifts will be given. Nothing can be more trolling than hanging up his stockings, and nothing more beautiful or fuller than a Christmas tree. But for some of you who would like to make a novelty in these honored ways of time, we'll just mention that it's good to make a ""noel-pie"" in a huge tin pan, with a crust of yellow cartridge paper, decorated with twirls and flowers the same, held with pins, and served on the eve of Christmas, full of pretty things and sugar-plums, jokes and small joking rhymes attached to the packages."
"One day there was a boy who came to visit the family who owned the birds, and very quickly he went to see the big cage. He had never seen anything similar before. He had never been so close to the birds who were sitting on trees or jumping in the middle of the branches. If the birds at home were as tamed as these, he could hit many of them, he thought. There was one that seemed more tamed than everything else. He approached him and said, ""Tweet! Tweet!"" The boy got a little stick and pushed him through the wires to little Tweet, and hit him. Poor little Tweet was scared and wounded. She flew to a branch of the tree and sat there, feeling very bad. When the boy found that he could no longer reach him with his stick, he left."
"A big difference between Mars and the other planets was that he had no moons; but on the night of August 16, Professor Hall of the American Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. saw through his telescope that Mars had a moon. On August 18, another was seen, smaller than the first and closer to the planet. The largest satellite would be no more than ten miles in diameter: it is less than 12,000 miles from its primary, and its period of revolution around is 30 hours 14 minutes. The distance of the smallest moon is 3,300 miles, and its period of 7 hours 38 minutes. There is no doubt that these newly found celestial bodies are the smallest known."
"The next question is, what is the best time to see fairies? I think I can tell you everything about it. The first rule is, that it must be a very hot day — which we can consider as settled; and you just have to be a little asleep — but not too sleepy to keep your eyes open, mind. Well, and you should feel a little — what you can call ""fairyish"" — the scotch calls it ""eerie"", and maybe it's a more beautiful word; if you don't know what that means, I fear I can't explain it; you have to wait for you to meet a fairy, and then you will know. And the last rule is that the grilles shouldn't piss off. I can't stop to explain this right now — you have to take it in trust for the present. So, if all these things happen together, you have a good chance of seeing a fairy — or at least a better chance than if they didn't do it."
"Elizabeth Eliza had heard in Philadelphia how many women had done, and she thought they had to contribute to such a cause. She had an idea, but she wouldn't talk about it at first, not before she wrote to the Philadelphia lady. She had often thought, in many cases, if they had first asked for advice, they could have saved trouble. Yet, how could they ask for advice before they knew what they wanted? It was very easy to ask for advice, but you first need to know what to ask. And again: Elizabeth Eliza thought you might have ideas, but you couldn't always put them together. There was this idea of the water pit, and then this idea of getting money for her."
"The Giant, about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his wolf, struck many blows on the bed, at the very place where Jack had laid the log; then he returned to his own room, thinking that he had broken all Jack's bones. Early in the morning, Jack put a bold face on the question and entered into the Giant's room to thank him for his lodging. The Giant began to see him, and began to stunned: ""Oh, dear me, is it you? Pray, how did you sleep last night? Did you hear or see anything in the dead of the night?"" ""Nothing is worth talking about,"" said Jack, carelessly; a rat, I believe, gave me three or four slaps with his tail, and bothered me a little; but I quickly went to sleep again."" The Giant asked himself more and more; but he did not answer a word, but he went to bring two large bowls of hashs for their breakfast."
"In France, during the First World War, the 142nd Infantry Regiment, 36th Division, had an Indian company that spoke 26 languages and dialects. Two officers were chosen to supervise a communication system composed of 18 Choctaw individuals. The team also sent messages concerning troop movements and their own tactical plans in their mother tongue. Soldiers from other tribes, including the Cheyenne, Comanche, Cherokee, Osage and Yankton Sioux, were also enlisted to communicate as a code spokesman. Prior to their arrival in France, the Germans had broken all the American codes used, resulting in the death of many soldiers. However, the Germans never broke the ""code"" of American Indians and these soldiers became affectionately known as ""code speakers""."
"King Edward, whom he remembers, was a man of multiple and varied interests. He was a sportsman in the best sense, an ardent and discriminant patron of the Arts, and as well equipped as any man of his time to give and take social relations; entirely free from prejudice and narrowing caste rules; at home in all enterprises; an emancipated citizen of the world. For a man as he was by nature, placed where he was by fortune and by circumstances, there had been open, had he chosen to enter, an unlimited field for self-indulgence. But, Sir, as everyone will recognize who has been put into daily contact with him in the field of business, his duty to the State has always come first. In this great business community there was no better businessman, no man by whom humble obligations – punctuality, method, precision, and saving time and speech – were more strongly recognized or more severely practiced."
"As a statesman, it is Mr Gladstone's chance that his career is not linked to war. The reforms he achieves, the triumphs he achieves, are not won by the supreme arbitrage of the sword. The reforms he achieves and the triumphs he achieves are the result of his power of persuasion over others. The reforms he achieves in many respects constitute a revolution. They change, in many cases, the face of the kingdom. After Sir Robert Peel had adopted the great principle that finally carried England from protection to free trade, it was Mr Gladstone who created the financial system that has since been admitted by all finance students as a secret to Britain's commercial success."
"The Supreme Court of the United States has certainly discovered that this cannot be done, because, in a Minnesota case, it held that when a state postponed the bad day of debt recovery, it was a valid and constitutional exercise of the legislative power. Now, ladies and gentlemen, if I can give you any other words that I think you can understand — I will not work on you by quoting tonight — I will tell you what wise men of all ages and times, until today, have all said: That you must keep the wealth of the scattered country, and you must limit the amount that any man can possess."
"At that time, the whole fabric had to be made at home. Aunt Dinah, Aunt Chloe, and Aunt Dilsey were busy turning and weaving to make clothes for the whole plantation. One day Mary's mother said, ""Aint Dilsey, Mary needs a new dress, and I want you to weave a little cloth at a time. Can you weave a very nice fabric?"" ""Yes, ma'am,"" said Aunt Dilsey. ""I have cotton that I saved to make her a dress."" Aunt Dilsey pulled out the cards and carded the cotton smooth and well. Then she tied a roll of that cotton to the brooch and sent the wheel whirlling around with a ""Zum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-"
"""The little girl wants a warm wool robe. I will give my wool. Who else will help?"" The kind shepherd said, ""I will do it."" Then he brought the old white sheep to the stream and washed the wool. When it was clean and white, he said, ""The little girl wants a warm wool robe. The sheep gave her wool, and I washed it clean and white. Who else will help?"" We go, said the shears. ""We will bring our shears and cut the wool."" The shears cut off the soft wool of the old sheep, and then they called, ""The little girl wants a new robe. The sheep gave her wool. The shepherd washed it; and we sheared it. Who else will help?"" We go, cry out the cardis. ""We will comb it straight and smooth."" Soon they wore the wool, squared straight and smooth, and they shouted, the little girl wants a new dress."
"One morning Hoangti and his wife were in the beautiful garden of the palace. They walked from top to bottom, speaking of their people. Suddenly the emperor said, ""Look at these worms on the mulberry trees, Si-ling. They seem to turn."" If-ling looked, and quite sure, the worms turned. A long thread came from each one's mouth, and each little worm rolled this thread around his body. If-ling and the emperor stood still and looked at the worms. ""What a wonder!"" said Si-ling. ""The next morning Hoangti and the Empress walked under the trees. They found a few more worms winding the yarn. Others had already spun their cocoons and slept fast. In a few days all the worms had spun cocoons. ""It is really a wonderful thing!"" said Si-ling."
"""Oh, wise judge,"" he cried, ""I came to you for righteousness. I had a beautiful horse, kind and gentle, which was killed by this man's wild horse. Make the horse pay or send him to prison."" ""Not so fast, my friend,"" said the judge. ""There are two sides of every case."" He turned to the poor man. ""Did your horse kill this man's horse?"" he asked. The poor man did not answer. The judge asked with surprise, ""Are you mute? Can't you speak?"" But no word came from the poor man's lips. The judge turned to the rich man. ""What more can I do?"" he asked. ""You see this poor man can't speak."" ""Oh, but he can,"" cried the rich man."
"Then the old goat went out into the dark woods; she had not gone long when there was a great rap at the door, and a voice cried out, ""Open the door, my dear children. I have something for each one of you."" But the young children knew by the rough voice that it was the old wolf. One of them said, ""We will not open the door. Our mother's voice is soft and sweet. Your voice is rough. You are a wolf. The old wolf fled into a shop, where he ate a piece of white chalk to make his soft voice. Then he returned to the goat's cabin and ignited himself at the door. He spoke with a soft voice and said, ""Open the door for me, my dear children. I am your mother."" But the oldest little goat thought of what his mother had said. ""If you are our mother, put your foot on the threshold of the window, so that we can see it."""
"Today, almost all states have a certain degree of vote. New York and Minnesota have given women the power to vote for the school county director. Illinois gives them a vote on all school elections, including a vote for state university administrators; Kansas allows them to vote in all municipal elections, and Wyoming has given them full recognition, placing them at the level of the male voter. Two of the four territories, Arizona and Oklahoma, have granted women the vote in school. Delaware gives them the vote in school and municipal elections. Mississippi gives them a vote on some minor issues. Arkansas and Missouri allow them to vote on licensing issues. Kentucky gives the vote to widows whose children attend schools. Tennessee and Texas give them the power to vote on minor issues. Most states give women the right to vote in commercial corporations of which they are shareholders, and almost all give them a vote on issues of local improvement."
"Roosevelt was so active that there was no more noise and noise, that he occupied the centre of each scene, that when he died, it was as if a wind had fallen, a light had gone out, that a military band had stopped playing. It was not so much the death of an individual as a general lowering of the vitality of the nation. America was less America, because it was no longer here. He should have lived twenty years more if he had been willing to go slowly, to stroll and to invite his soul, to nourish this spirit of passive wisdom. But there was no rest on him, and his pleasures were as strong as his toys. John Burroughs tells us that he did not care about fishing, the leisure of contemplative man."
"It was not until the last twenty years that chemists reached a complete point of view in the field of organic chemistry. It was found possible to progressively distribute most of the carbon compounds under two categories, either as marsh gas or as benzol derivatives, as fatty compounds or as aromatic compounds. To do this, methods of analysis very different from those used in mineral chemistry had to be applied. The simple discovery of the percentage composition tells us little or nothing about an organic compound. What are the elements that make up the compound should not be discovered. This can be said in advance with almost absolute certainty. What is wanted is to know how carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms are linked together, because, strangely, these differences in groups, which may exist between these three or four elements, give compounds radically different properties and serve as a basis for classification."
"The brave Geraint, knight of the court of Arthur, prince tributary of Devon, one of this great order of the Round Table, had married Enid, the only child of Yniol, and loved him, as he loved the light of Heaven. And as the light of Heaven varies, now at sunrise, now at sunset, now the night with the moon and the trembling stars, so loved Geraint To make his beauty vary day after day, in purple and gems. And Enid, but to please the eye of her husband, who had found her and loved her first in a state of broken fortune, presented her every day in a fresh splendour; and the Queen herself, loved her, and often with her own white hands, was, and was, as the most loved her, after her own me, in all the court. And Enid loved the Queen, and with the true heart, worshipped her, as the elite and most beautiful and beautiful of all the women on earth."
"And the king rose up and moved his host by night, and he always pushed Sir Modred, the league by league, back to the sunset bound to Lyonnesse—A land of old heaven from the abyss By fire, to sink again into the abyss; where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt, And the long mountains ended in a coast of ever-changing sand, and far The ghost circle of a moaning sea. There the pursuer could no longer pursue, And he who no longer fled to steal the king; And there, that day when the great light of the sky burned at its lowest in the rolling year, On the sand wasted by the spoiled sea they shut up."
"The new model that I inspected had a monoplane body, an observer and a sitting tandem pilot, the Mercedes engine (several cylinders) being at the front. It was designed not for speed but for weight, as indicated by its formidable arsenal of bombs. The beauty of the finishing and machining of these infernal machines was interesting. The forty pounds and twenty pounds looked like miniature torpedoes, with slightly bulbous bodies and rounded noses, with a small three-strand propeller for a tail and a steel ring to serve as a handhold. When the aviator is ready to lay a bomb, all he has to do is make a simple adjustment, taking no more than a second, which releases the propeller, then throws the bomb overboard. By dropping the propeller is put in motion quickly and drives the working mechanism of the clock inside the bomb."
"General von Haenisch took me from a distance and explained to me how the business was going. A good telephone operator, he developed, was almost as important as a competent general, the ""centre"" telephone, the most vital place of an army. Here are three large switchboards with soldiers playing the girl's phone, while other soldiers, with receivers fixed on their heads, were sitting at offices busy taking messages on printed ""business"" forms. In the next room, seated the staff officers in service, waiting for the phone bell to be jingled with the latest reports of the front. There was no wait because the numbers were ""engaged"" or the operators were gloating; you could get Berlin or Vienna without having to swear at ""long distance""."
"The advantages of the chemical engine are well summarized in the following statement: The superiority of a chemical engine is composed - 1st. In its simplicity. It dispenses with complex machines, experienced engineers, tanks and steam. Carbonic acid gas is both the working agent and the extinguishing agent. 2d. In a hurry. It is always ready. No steam to rise up, no fire to be lit, no pipe to be laid, no large company to gather. Chemicals are kept in place, and the gas generated the desired moment. In half of the time thus saved is a building. Five minutes at the right time is worth five hours later. 3d. In efficiency. The poorly applied sea water feeds the fire, but the carbonic acid gas never. In bulk, it is forty times more efficient than water, the seventy gallons of the two smallest cylinders being equal to twenty-eight hundred gallons of water. In addition, it uses the only agent that will quench tar, oil, and other combustible fluids and vapours."
"Fizeau stated that his copper wire speed was 111,780 miles per second; Walker that he traveled this medium only 18,400 miles during the same interval; while experiments in the United States when determining the longitudes of various stations have further reduced the rate of movement to some 16,000 miles per second. Whatever these values we adopt, however, we can take for our present purpose that the transmission of a message by the electric telegraph is practically instantaneous. But whether it is noted here, there is not one thing like a hora mundi or a common time for the whole world. What is known as longitude is really the difference in the time, east or west, of a line passing through the north and south poles of the earth; and the middle of the great transit circle is the Royal Observatory at Greenwich."
"Mr. Tresca recently presented to the Academy of Sciences very interesting experiments on the development and distribution of the heat produced by a blow of the steam hammer in the forging process. The method used was as follows: The bar was carefully polished on both sides, and this polished part covered with a thin layer of wax. He was then placed on an anvil and struck by a known weight monkey, P, falling from a height, H. The faces of the monkey and the anvil were exactly the same, and care was taken that the whole work, T = PH, was spent on the bar. Only one blow was enough to melt the wax on a certain area; and this clearly indicated how high the lateral faces had been by the shock at the melting temperature of the wax."
"The lecturer then, using diagrams which he placed on the blackboard, showed the forms of different forms of photographic lenses, and explained the influence of particular constructions in the production of certain results; the positive and negative spherical aberration, and the way in which they are made to balance, was also described by diagrams, as it was also chromatic aberration. He then spoke about the optical center of lenses, and said that it was not, as had been assumed so far, the true place from which to measure the focus of a lens or combination."
"Recently, at 31 Lombard Street, London, there was a private exhibition of the Holmes and Burke primary galvanic battery. The main object of the exhibition was to demonstrate its ability to light railway trains, but at the same time, means were provided to show it in the context of ordinary domestic lighting, as it is evident that a battery will serve both for the latter and for the first purpose. Already the great Northern express which leaves London at 5:30 pm is illuminated by this means, and satisfactory experiments have been made on the southwest line, while the inventors give a long list of other companies to which the experimental plant must be supplied. The battery shown in Lombard Street consisted of fifteen cells arranged in three boxes of five cells. Each box measured about 18"" by 12"" by 10"" and weighed 75 lb. to 100 lb."
"Despite the enormous appeal to the country's human power for the ever-increasing needs of the army, the supply of ammunition has continued to increase. In addition to large shipments to other war fronts, there has been an increase of 30 per cent in all kinds of weapons and shells, and more than 100 per cent in heavy weapons and shells in the recent offensive in France, compared to last year. The weight of shells filled per month has more than doubled since 1916. The production of high explosives has sufficed to meet the increased demands of our armies, to build stocks, and to meet in part the needs of the Allies."
"It's carnival day. Hooray! cries Little Mouse. Hooray! cries Littler Mouse. Hooray! cries Tiny Mouse. They intend to ride every lap! ""But don't lose me!"" Tiny Mouse said to his brothers. They fight on toy cars. They climb up and down on the merry-go-round. They climb on the winding basement of the caterpillars. They take a ride on Ferris' wheel. The brothers walk to the balloon basket and they each buy a balloon. One balloon, two balloons... ""Wait, where is Tiny Mouse?"" Little Mouse and Littler Mouse run toy buses. Tiny Mouse is not there either. They run to the merry-go-round. Tiny Mouse is not there. They run to the undersolar of caterpillars. Tiny Mouse is not there either."
"Chunu said, ""Brrr, how cold it is!"" Munu said, ""Yes, so cold!"" Chunu said, ""I'm going to wear warm clothes to protect me from the cold."" ""Where's my warm hat?"" Chunu wondered. ""He was here yesterday. Where did he go today?"" ""I can't find my warm socks!"" Munu cried. ""Where are my warm socks?"" ""My feet are so cold, they're numb!"" ""Me too,"" Munu said to his sister. ""Brrr, so cold!"" ""It's so cold!"" ""We can't find my warm hat. We can't find your warm socks."" ""Where could our clothes be?"" Munu wondered. ""Here's my warm coat!"" Chunu said. ""But where are my other clothes?"" ""Chunu, look here, Munu weep. ""Look in the hole."" Chunu and Munu looked inside the hole."
"When a soil expert visits an unproductive farm to determine his/her needs, he/she is primarily interested in four possible factors of his/her problem: lack of drainage, lime, organic matter and available plant food. His/her first concern is drainage. If the water from the rains is kept on the surface by an impermeable layer below, it is inactive to spend money on other amendments until the difficulty of drainage has been overcome. A soil soaked in water is powerless. He/she cannot provide the available food, air and heat to the plants. Drainage is urgent when the level of dead water in the soil is close to the surface. The area requiring drainage is larger than most landowners believe, and it increases as the soil ages."
"When Lavande arrived, it was very quiet. He saw nothing but a log floating in the water and a bird nearby. Suddenly, the log swallowed the bird! Oh! It was not a log after all. It was Gator. As usual, Gator was sitting like a statue, waiting for his prey. Lavande slipped into fear and quickly fled home before someone saw him. He sat in the trees, while he trembled with fear, and thought: ""Where is my house... oh yes! It's on the fourth tree. Ok, let me count then. One, two three, ten. Oh no! two, seven, five... No, I guess I'm so afraid I can't even count!"" When Lavande's friend, Plum, noticed that he hadn't come home yet, he went to pick him up."
"King Baye Jeanne chose his reward. Already horses, rich armors, and jewelling daggers had been given to him. These, adding to the beauty and glory of his appearance, had made men follow her more willingly, and for that she appreciated them. She gave gifts to noble ladies, and gave much to the poor. She only wanted money to wage war, not for herself. Her family was made noble; on their shield, between two lilies, a sword supported the crown. Her father was in Reims, and lives her in his glory. What reward, then, was Joan to choose? She chose nothing for herself, but that her native village of Domremy should be free of taxes. This news her father carried to the house of the splendid scene in Reims."
"It was at the time when Charles II wanted to force most of the inhabitants of Scotland to change their religion and worship as he told them. Some obeyed the king, but most hated the new order of things, and clinged in their hearts to their old ways and their former ministers, who had been put out of their churches and their houses when the king came. Many even began to resist the king in the open battle rather than obey him in the business of their consciences. It was only in this that they were rebelled, for many of them had been active in bringing him back to the throne. Among those who therefore went away to fight were William Gordon and his son Alexander. William Gordon was a serious, courteous and venerable man, and his estate was one of the best in all Galloway. Like almost all the lairds of the south and west, he was strongly of the Presbyterian party, and determined to give life and land rather than his principles."
"Between his apprehension and his trial, no friend or relative had been allowed to visit him; but now that his death was assured, a greater license had been granted. But, anxious to deprive his enemies of a chance to accuse his sons, he had sent them his serious requests and orders to refrain from using this permission until the night before his execution. They had obeyed; but obedience of this kind would not satisfy the conscience of his daughter Grizel. The night of his condemnation, he heard the key turn in his door; thinking that it could only be the jailer, he hardly lifted his eyes."
"All the ancient money of the colony was handed over to Captain John Hull. The beaten silver cannons and the tanks, I suppose, and the silver curls, and the broken spoons, and the silver buttons of the worn coats, and the silver heels of the swords that had appeared in the court, all these curious items were doubtless thrown into the melting pot together. But by far most of the money was made up of bulls from the mines of South America, that the English bucaners, which were little better than the pirates, had taken Spanish and brought to Massachusetts. All this old and new money being melted and invented, the result was an immense quantity of splendid shillings, six pences, and three pences. Each had the date 1652 on one side and the figure of one pine on the other."
"When the sun jumped the next morning, and the tropical night suddenly burst into the tropic day, Amyas walked on the deck, with undressed hair and torn clothes, her red eyes of rage and tears, her heart full, how can I describe it? Imagine it yourself, you who have already lost a brother; and you who have not, thank God you do not know anything about her agony. Many impossible projects, he stretched and suffocated, as the ship shook through the rolling seas. He would return to burn the villa. He would take Guayra, and there would be the life of every man in exchange for that of his brother. ""We can do it, the guys!"" he cried. ""If Drake took the Chamber of Dios, we could take La Guayra."" And every voice shouted, ""Yes."""
"The Persian army had to walk on the edge of the gulf. They could not cross the country straight, because the ridge of the mountains called Oeta rose and barred their way. Indeed, the woods, the rocks and the precipices descended so close to the sea, that in two places there was only one wheel track between the slopes and the impassable morass that formed the boundary of the gulf on its south side. These two very narrow places were called the gates of the pass, and were about a mile apart. There remained a little more width in the intermediate space; but in this there were a number of sources of hot mineral water, salt and sulphur, which were used for the sick to bathe, and thus the place was called Thermopylia, or the hot gates."
"The first dispute between Rome and Carthage concerned their possession in the island of Sicily; and the war thus begun had lasted eight years, when it was resolved to send an army to fight the Carthaginians on their own coasts. The army and the fleet were under the command of the two consuls, Lucius Manlius and Marcus Attilius Regulus. On the way there was a great battle of sea with the Carthaginian fleet, and it was the first naval battle that the Romans had ever won. It liberated Africa; but the soldiers, who had never been so far from their home before, murmured, for they expected to meet not only human enemies, but monstrous snakes, lions, elephants, donkeys with horns, and monsters with dog heads, to have a burning sun above them, and a noisy marsh under their feet."
"All this dazzling army, at their head the king's great royal stallion with the golden lilies of France surrounded with the lions of England, and every troop guided by the square banner, a pennon with a swallowed tail or pointed penoncel of their leader, came to walk to the gates of Calais, above which the blue stallion of France floated with its golden flowers, and with it the banner of the governor, Sir John of Vienna. A herald, in a long robe embroidered with the arms of England, went up to the door, a trumpet ringing in front of him, and called Sir John of Vienna to give the place to Edward, king of England, and of France, as he claimed. Sir John replied that he held the city for Philip, king of France, and that he would defend it until the last; the herald went up and the English began the siege of the city."
"In 1439 King Albert died, who had been appointed king of Hungary to the right of his wife, Queen Elizabeth. He left a little girl only four years old, and since the Magyars had never been ruled by a female hand, they offered to send and offer their crown, and the hand of their young widowed queen, to Wladislas, the king of Poland. But Elizabeth had the hope of another child, and in case he was a son, she did not intend to give her rights to her father's throne. So how was she going to help herself among the proud and determined nobles of her court?"
"The Imperial Chancellor stated that there was irrefutable evidence that if Germany failed to cross Belgium, its enemies would do so. This proof, as it is now produced, is of the utmost importance. The Chancellor was therefore right to appeal to the law of necessity, although he did not regret that it violated international law. This law of necessity was recognized as paramount by almost all eminent statesmen, including Gladstone, and by all professors of international law, even by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, vol. 130, p. 601, with regard to the treaty with China concerning Chinese immigration to the United States: ""It will not be presumed that the legislative service of the government will adopt lightly laws that conflict with the treaties of the country, but that circumstances could occur that would not only justify the government by disregarding their provisions, but would require it to do so in the interests of the country, it cannot be said."
"Dr. Eder pays particular attention for a considerable period of time to promoters of soda and potash, one of which seems to offer certain advantages over ammonia pyrogal. This advantage is manifested by emulsions prepared with ammonia, which frequently manifest themselves with green or red ammonia fog, or a fog of clay colour per reflection, and pale violet by the transmitted light. Ferrous oxalate works very well with plates of this type; soda and potassa developers. For soda developers, Eder uses a solution of 10 parts of pure crystallized soda in 100 parts of water. For use, 100 c.c. of this solution are mixed with 6 c.c. of a 1:10 pyrogallic solution, without the addition of bromide."
"I have here in a water test tube in which a small piece of meat was placed a few days ago. The test tube was in a rather hot room, and the meat began to decompose. What happened here is the first step of this investigation. This is the question that the scientists worked on, and the study from which came a valuable complement to the surgical knowledge associated with the name of Professor Lister, and known as antiseptic. What happens to this meat, and what happens in the water surrounding it? How long will it be before all the smell of putrefaction is gone and the water is clear again? Because it becomes clear in time, and instead of meat we find a fine powdery substance at the bottom of the test tube."
"Since the right restrictions of the law are the best for men and women, so that the right restrictions of the house are the best for boys and girls. A boy whose all restraint influences are suddenly removed – who may have his own unmolested way – is in the greatest danger of ruining his life. The temptations of power have been the cause of a lot of sadness and misery in the world. And this temptation came to this boy King of Sweden called in his fifteenth year to depart from a great kingdom of faithful subjects. Freed from the severity of his severe father's discipline, he found himself responsible to no one – absolutely his own master. And he did what too many of us, I fear, would have done in his position – he decided to have a good time, which could happen; and he had it – in his own way."
"""Some phtsic patients, of which there are, alas! too many, have been admitted from time to time to St. Vincent's Hospital. They have been admitted at all stages, from the beginning to the most advanced. At each admission, the case has been carefully examined; the history, symptoms and physical signs have been recorded exactly; and the patient has been weighed on a stage balance with great precision. The patient has been placed as far as possible on the treatment of mullein only. For obvious reasons, no cod oil, koumiss, or other weight producer has been given; patients have obtained the appropriate diet for these patients; and, if the special symptoms have become uncomfortable, have received the appropriate treatment."
"But, although General Lee was now a very ardent American soldier, he could not forgive Mr. Washington for taking command over him. If this gentleman from Virginia had had the courtesy and common sense that were generally attributed to him, he would have resigned from the supreme command, and, modestly by moving away, would have asked General Lee to accept it. At least, that was the opinion of General Charles Lee. Since this high and powerful soldier was so unwilling to submit to the orders of incompetent people, he never liked to be under direct command of Washington, and if it were possible to do so, he managed to deal with operations not under the immediate eye of the commander-in-chief. In fact, he was very jealous indeed of Washington, and did not hesitate to express his opinion on him whenever he had a chance."
"Helen Adams Keller was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama, United States. Her family lived in an estate called Ivy Greens, built by Hélène's grandfather. Her father, Arthur Keller, spent many years as editor for the newspaper Tuscumbia North Alabamian, and had served as captain in the army. Her mother, Kate Adams, was the daughter of a confederate general. Helen was born with the ability to see and hear. At 19 months, she became ill, and this disease left Helen both deaf and blind. As she grew up, she found a way to communicate with the daughter of the family cook; Martha Washington. They invented a kind of sign language and at the age of seven, they created more than 60 different signs to use it in their personal communication."
"In many industries, there are operations that need to be repeated at regular intervals, and for this reason, the construction of a device to give a signal, not only at the set time, but also at equal intervals, is a matter of interest. The question of doing this has been resolved in a very elegant way by Mr. Silas in the invention of the device. It consists of a clock whose dial is supplied with a series of small pins. The hands are isolated from the case and communicate with one of the poles of a battery contained in the box. The case is connected to the other pole. A small vibrating bell is interposed in the circuit. If you need to obtain a signal at a certain time, the corresponding pin is inserted, and the hand touching this firm circuit, and the bell rings. The bell is also enclosed in the box. There are two rows of pins, one for hours, the other for minutes."
"Until recently, free methyl chloride had not received any industrial application, due to the difficulty of preparing it to a state of purity at a low price. Mr. C. Vincent, however, has made known a process that allows this product to be obtained abundantly and cheaply. It consists in subjecting to heat the trimethylamine chlorate, which is obtained as a by-product in the manufacture of beet potash. Chlorate is thus decomposed into free trimethylamine, ammonia and methyl chloride. A hydrochloric acid wash removes all traces of alkali, and the gas, which is collected under a water receptor, can then be dried with sulphuric acid, and be liquefied by pressure. Pure methyl liquid chloride is now an abundant product. There are two uses to which it is applied: first, to produce coal tar dyes, and secondly, to produce coal tar dyes."
"One of the most remarkable and interesting mechanical devices in the Imperial Triage of the Navy in Kiel, Germany, is the iron sheet folding machine, by which heavy iron plates are folded for the use of iron ships. Thanks to the mechanism of this remarkable machine, it is possible to fold the strongest and heaviest iron plates, in a cold state, so that they can be mounted close to the hull of the ship, as was done with the warships Saxonia, Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden, each of which has an iron resistance of about 250 meters. It is possible to get an idea of the enormous pressure power of such a machine, if it can imagine what force is necessary to fold an iron plate of 250 meters thick, in cold condition; being also 1.5 meters wide, and 5.00 meters long, and weighing about 14,555 kilograms, or 14,555 tons."
"In 1820, Mr. Cecil, of Cambridge, proposed the use of a mixture of air and hydrogen as a source of motor power; he gave a detailed account of his invention in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, as well as some interesting theoretical considerations. The author observes here that an explosion can be safely combated by an elastic resistance - that of compressed air, for example - if such resistance has little or no inertia to be put into play; unlike, the smallest inertia opposed to the explosion of a mixture subjected to instantaneous combustion is equivalent to an insurmountable obstacle. Thus, a small quantity of gunpowder, or a detonating mixture of air and hydrogen, can be lit safely in a large closed container full of air, because the pressure exerted on the sides of the container by the explosion is no more than the pressure of the air compressed by the explosion."
"The Russian government has just built at the shipyards of Mr. Normand, the famous engineer Havre, a torpedo called the Poti, which we illustrate below. This ship differs in a perceptible way from all the others in its class, at least with regard to its model. Its extremities, strongly depressed in the upper structures, and the excessive inclination of its sides, give the ship as a whole a certain resemblance to the rams of our navy, such as the Taurus and the Tiger. A cross section of the Poti is approaching a shapely ellipse. Its water lines are extremely fine, and in no way elegant to those of the most renowned yachts. The ship is entirely made of steel, and its dimensions are as follows: Length, 28 meters; Extreme width, 3.6 meters; Depth, 2.5 meters; Drawing, 1.9 meters; Displacement, 66 tons. The engine, which is a compound, is 600 H.P. The minimum speed required is 18 knots, or 33-34 meters, and it will probably reach 40 kilometers."
"This stove consists of two or more superimposed pipes equipped with radiators. A gas burner is placed at the inlet of the upper or lower pipe, depending on the circumstances. Combustion products are discharged by a pipe of small diameter, which can be easily inserted into an existing chimney or be hidden behind the hose. The heat provided by the gas flame is so well absorbed by the radiation of the radiator rings that the gases, by making their outlet, no longer have a temperature of more than 35 to 40 degrees. The appliance, which is simple, compact, and cheap, is surrounded by all sides of an adorned sheet metal housing. Being entirely of cast iron, it will last a long time. The joints, being asbestos, are absolutely tight, in order to prevent the escape of bad odours. The water due to condensation of the gases is driven by a small pipe outside the doors or in a container from which it can evaporate again, so as not to change the hygrometric state of the air."
"As an experience illustrating the advantage of this: that a camera be placed near the wall, then the babysitter arranged so that from this point of view one obtains a face of three quarters, and it will be noticed that there is very little need of the reflector at all. Let us now take a negative, and the camera brings, say, five feet in the room, and the babysitter, without changing seat, turns around until a similar view of the face is obtained from that point. We will now see that the shadows are much deeper than before, and the reflector will have to be brought close enough to overcome them; nevertheless, they can be obtained just as smooth and harmonious as in the first case."
"It is universally observable that where villages have been bombed, attempts have been made to spare the houses of the peasants, few of which have been damaged, except by fires that spread other buildings. Everywhere destruction has been avoided, and the percentage of cities in this area where all damage has been done is small. The above facts mean the restraint and sobriety exercised by both Cossacks and the following infantry. The indigenous people were not hostile to the Russians, which would explain in part this, but the discipline that has been exposed is important even in a friendly country, when one considers the size and extent of the invasive armies. Other conclusions based on conversations with Russian officials, who have obviously been prejudiced, and with the peasants, whose evidence has been given to a correspondent accompanying these officers, must be accepted by guard."
"Rhea, which is also known as ramie, is a textile plant that has been native to China and India. It is perennial, easy to grow, and produces a remarkably strong fibre. The problem of its cultivation has long been solved, because within certain limits rhea can be cultivated in any climate. India and the British colonies offer unusual facilities, and have vast and suitable fields for this enterprise, while it can be, and is, cultivated in most European countries. All this has been demonstrated for a long time; not so, however, the commercial use of fiber, which until now seems to be only partially solved, although many serious workers have been engaged in the solution of attempt. There have been difficulties in the way of decorating the stems of this plant, and the Indian government, in 1869, offered a reward of £5,000 for the best machine to separate fiber from the stems and bark of rhea in its green or freshly cut state."
"For those who do not know, the city of Penang is located on the west coast of the Malaysian peninsula, just below the Siamese border. It is the point of dispatch of the Malay states, where 65 percent. tin from the world is produced, as well as a large quantity of rubber and copra. With a population of 246,000, it develops leaps and limits and gives any indication to soon become one of the largest ports in the Far East. The thing that makes this city a point of importance in the present war is the fact that it is the last port of call for ships from China and Japan to Colombo and Europe. As a result, it has been made more or less of a naval base by the British government."
"The owner of the island and the sheep, A.P. Moore, a few years ago, bought the property from the widow of his deceased brother Henry, for $600,000. Because of his ill health, he rented it to his brother Lawrence for $140,000 a year, and soon begins for Boston, where he will settle for the rest of his life. He still retains an interest in the ranch of Santa Cruz Island, which is about 25 miles southeast of Santa Barbara. This island contains about 64,000 acres, and on it are 25,000 sheep. On Catalina Island, 60 miles east of Santa Barbara, are 15,000 sheep, and on Clementa Island, 80 miles east of this city, are 10,000 sheep."
"The construction of rotary presses for the printing of illustrated papers was attempted in 1874 or 1875 in London, by the Times, but apparently without success, as no public mention was ever made of a favorable result. The owner of the London Illustrated News obtained better results. In 1877, an illustrated paper, an outgrowth of his great newspaper, was printed on a rotating press which, according to his statement, was built by a machinist named Middleton. The first, however, did not at all meet the higher requirements of the illustrated periodical printing, and, while another machine built on the same principle was shown in the Paris Exhibition of 1878, his work was neither in quality nor in adequate quantity to the needs of a widely distributed illustrated paper. A second machine, also exposed at the same time, designed and constructed by the famous French machinist, P. Alauzet, could not be considered as having reached the object. Its construction was undertaken long after the opening of the Exhibition, and too late to solve the important question."
"Schoene gave the results of an extensive series of experiments on the use of thallium paper to estimate approximately the oxidizing material in the atmosphere, whether hydrogen peroxide alone, or mixed with ozone, or perhaps also with other previously unknown constituents. The objection to the Schönbein ozonometer (potassium iodide on starch paper) and the Houzeau ozonometer (potassium iodide on litmus red paper) is that their materials are hygroscopic, and their indications vary widely with the humidity of the air. Since dry ozone does not act on these papers, they must be humidified; then the amount of moisture varies as much as the amount of ozone. Indeed, attention has been drawn to the greatest amount of ozone near salt works and cascades, and the erroneous opinion has suggested that ozone is formed when water is finely divided."
"Z. acuminata is one of the most useful and valuable Japanese wood trees. It was found near Yeddo by the late John Gould Veitch, and was sent by the firm of Messrs. J. Veitch & Sons. Maximowicz also found the tree in Japan, and introduced it to the Imperial Botanical Gardens of St. Petersburg, from which the seeds and plants were distributed liberally. In the Gardeners' Chronicle for 1862 Dr. Lindley writes the following: ""A noble deciduous tree, discovered near Yeddo by Mr. J. G. Veitch, from 90 feet to 100 feet tall, with a remarkably straight stem."
"My first visit was the largest hall in Warsaw, called the Swiss Valley, where the great philharmonic concerts are usually organized and which, usually, is the gathering place of the society. It is now transformed into a refuge for 600 or 700 homeless fugitives, who have left everything behind and fled in terror, often on foot, for many kilometres, and carrying their possessions on their backs. The majority are old people, women and children. In the very little voices are often heard pitiful screams of malnourished children, louder screams of children, moanings and lamentations of mothers who still seem astonished and astonished by their terrible experiences."
"The world has invested a great deal in the blood and treasure, and all that they involve, in the education of England. It is satisfied – the world's response to the insolent challenge of Germany is proof of this – that its pains have been well given. England is better able than any other nation to exercise the power that belongs to it. This does not consist in denying the special virtues of other nations; indeed, these virtues have greatly contributed to the result. Italy has educated it; France has educated it; we have done something; and Germany. Consequently, it is not perfect — perhaps the English would say the least — but it has learned a great deal and stood steady while it was learning it. It is a more important job that the world cares to teach any other nation."
"I could see that the room beyond the window was naked. I never saw anyone in it. The heat had to be terrible, because it could not have had any ventilation. Once I missed the boy from the balcony, but I saw his white head moving slowly in the dusk of the room. Little by little, the little man became a burden for me. I found myself constantly thinking about him, and troubled by this remorse that the unthinking people felt even for the suffering for which they were not the least responsible. Not that I never saw any suffering on his face. It was patient, thoughtful, serious, but with never a sign of petulance. What thoughts filled this young head — what contemplation took the place of what should have been the ineffable source of childish emotion — what complaint or questioning lived behind this white face — no one could guess."
"The agitator is an important part of the apparatus. Its object, in this instrument, is double. First, it is used to produce a uniform temperature throughout the body of the water in the instrument; and second, it responds as a support to the platinum or other metal heating carrier, often intensely warm, which would injure or destroy the delicate metal of the background if it were allowed to fall on it. For this second lens, no spiral rotating agitator, as recommended by Berthelot, would suffice. A concave disc of the leaf-arms, made to conform to the shape of the bottom of the cell, with a narrow border turned all around, about 0.02 inches thick, is widely perforated by holes to illuminate it, and to give free passage to the water. The concave form causes the water currents, produced by raising and lowering it slightly, to take a radial direction down or upward, in order to cross and favor the rapid mixing."
"In 1832, Dr. James Mease of Philadelphia published a monograph on ""The Cause, Healing and Prevention of Sick Headache"", which is essentially a treatise on the dietetics of this particular form of headache. The work, however, clearly lacks in the philosophical qualities that are so necessary for a true understanding of the issues in question. Dr. E.H. Sieveking published in 1854 a very interesting article on ""Chronic and Periodic Headache."" The views he expresses are remarkable for their succinctness and the scientific elucidation of the two major physiological principles involved in the examination by far the greatest majority of cases of headache. I refer to the importance attributed by this eminent physician to the fluctuations in blood flow in the skull. Speaking of this topic, Dr. Sieveking says: ""Nothing is more important in reference to pathology and to the treatment of the head than clear and well-defined notions on the physiological subject of circulation in the skull."
"All things considered, there is no way to keep apples so good and so practical as to pack them in light barrels and store them in cold cellars; the barrel forms a room in a room, and prevents the air circulation and drying and shrinking of the resulting fruit, and also reduces temperature changes, and in addition, more fruit can be packaged and stored in a given space than in another way. The poorest in any way is the large open bin, and the objections are: too much fruit in contact; too much weight on the lower fruit; and too much difficulty in handling and sorting when it is desirable to market."
"I believe that there is no permanent greatness for a nation, except that it is based on morality. I do not care about military greatness or military fame. I care about the condition of the people among whom I live. There is no man in England who is less likely to speak irreverently of the crown and monarchy of England than I am; but the crowns, coronets, mitres, military displays, the pump of war, the great colonies, and an immense empire, are, in my opinion, all light as air, and are not worth considering, unless with them you can have a fair share of comfort, contentment and happiness, among the great body of the people."
"To coat the metal plate, place it on a rotating table, to which it is made fast in the centre by a pneumatic support; to ensure the perfect adhesion of this support, it is also to wet the circular elastic ring of the support before applying it to the metal surface. When done, the table can be made to rotate quickly without fear of detaching the plate by the speed of movement. The plate is placed in a perfectly horizontal position, where no dust can be deposited on it; the mixture is then poured on it, and distributed by means of a triangular piece of flexible paper, so as to cover also all parts of the plate. Care must be taken not to pour too much liquid on the plate, and when it is coated everywhere, the excess is poured into a container different from the one that contains the filtered mixture, or in a filter resting on it."
"The police and sheriffs, followed by the military, forcibly take everything that happens in the food, enter the bakeries and other shops selling food, embark ships with cargoes of flour, potatoes, wheat, rice, etc., and take care of almost everything, giving in place of payment a receipt that does not even worth the paper on which it is written. In this way, many shops are forced to close, the bread has completely disappeared from the bakeries, and Constantinople, the capital of a neutral country, already feels all the problems and the deprivations of a besieged city. Food prices have climbed to inaccessible heights as the provisions become scarce."
"All the animals laughed as they looked at Bonney. Bonney stopped and looked at them and asked them, ""What's so funny?"" ""Are my back doors open? Are my front tires flat? Is my rear-view mirror out of place?"" Rabbit approached Bonney and said, ""Why are you pretending to be a car?"" Bonney said, ""I'm not pretending to be a car. I am a car. I have four doors. Beep! Beep! Vroom!"" Ms. Goose pointed out Bonney's reflection in the lake and said, ""Goody, you're an h-o-r-s-e."" Bonney looked at his image and opened his mouth to look at his teeth and shook his head, saying, ""I don't see a horse."" Then she opened her mouth and said, ""Look at this engine, I put oil on him, so as not to overheat."""
"Our little house was located at the foot of a hill on a slope, sheltered with a beautiful undergrowth, and a sloping river; on one side of a meadow, on the other side of a green. My farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land. Nothing could exceed the cleanliness of my little enclosures, the elms and hedges appearing with an unexpressible beauty. My house had only one story, and was covered with thatch, which gave it a great look of punaise; the walls of the interior were well bleached, and my daughters undertook to adorn them with images of their own design. Although the same room was used as a living room and kitchen, which was only the warmest. Moreover, as it was kept with the greatest cleanliness, the dishes, plates and brass being well escorted and all arranged in bright rows on the shelves, the eye was nicely raised and did not want any richer furniture. There were three other apartments; the third was for me; the third was for me; the second was for me; the second was for me; the child; the second was for me; the second was for me; the second was for my wife; and the second was for me; the other was for my wife; the second was for my wife; and the second was for my wife; the second was for my wife; and the second was for my wife; and the second was for my wife."
"Suddenly, as Thérèse was sitting there, her head, filled with her tender thoughts of me, held in her soft hands, I felt the step of Allan on the staircase carpeted outside. Therese also felt it, — but how? for it was not audible. She gave a start, swept the black envelopes out of sight, and pretended to write in a small book. Then I forgot to look at her longer in my absorption into the arrival of Allan. Of course it was him that I was waiting. It was for him that I had made this first lonely effort and afraid to return, to recover... It was not that I had allowed myself to recognize my presence, for I had long known enough his difficult and rapid denials of the invisible. He was always so reasonable, so healthy of mind, so blind."
"Junior felt so sad and misunderstood and thought of himself: ""I'm going to run away to a place where no one is going to take my things away from me and I can do what I want. But just where should I go?"" Then he had an idea. He's going to run into space. How? In a spaceship that's going to take him off the gravity of the Earth and of all those who are upset with him. He won't find this spaceship in any exhibition room or garage. In fact, Junior will just have to do it himself. He ran to the kitchen and attic, collecting all the metal objects he could find. He collected pots, utensils and other debris - even an old TV antenna! He stuck everything together until he was finally safe and ready to take off."
"The Germans made a routine of their attacks, making them always at night and still inefficient. They advance to the barbed wire, 30 yards in front of the trench. There, they meet the full force of the Russian rifle fire and fall back again. The Germans constantly bombard. All the Russians talk about their heavy expenditure of ammunition. The trench commander told me that at the bottom they fired more than 3000 shells in one day. Although intermittent fire continued during the night, no attack was made. In the morning the German weapons resumed their exhaustive quest along the back of the trenches, and a large factory towards the south became their target. Its large chimney began to acquire a kind of sporting importance, it was so obviously the object of fire in this direction; and the bets went into the trench supporting the chimney against the German gunners."
"The day of a definitive victory has not yet come. Our task until then will be heavy, and it may be a long time. Let us bring all our strength in the accomplishment of this task. Our allies know that we will do so, as well as the neutral nations, and it is in vain that a wild campaign of false news has been launched. If Germany, at first, pretended to have a doubt about France's attitude, it does not doubt any more. Let Germany now testify that, when the French Parliament reopened after more than four months of war, it renewed before the world the spectacle it offered the day when, in the name of the nation, it took up the challenge. To conquer, heroism at the border will not suffice. We must also have an internal union. Let us continue to preserve this sacred union from all faults today, as in the past, and in the future."
"The small bright scarlet berries of this plant make it, when well cultivated, one of the most beautiful ornaments for the warm house, the conservatory, or even for a warm room. It is quite easy to manage, wandering seeds even when growing up where they fall, and making beautiful specimens. For the interior decoration, few subjects are more interesting, and some plants can be managed so as to have them in the fruits in succession all year round. Any kind of soil will answer for this Rivina. The cuts of this one freely hit, but it is easier obtained from seeds. Either one or three plants can occupy a pot of 6 inches, and this is the best size for the decoration of the table. Usually, it is preferable to raise some plants each year and to throw away the old stock, but some can be retained for cultivation in large specimens. These should be cut back before they are started to grow."
"Take the whale oil. Take the funny old buildings on Front Street, out of the paintings, I declare, by Howard Pyle, where are the great whale oil merchants. Take the salted fish. Do you know the oldest house of salted fish in America, down by Coenties Slip? Ah! you should. The ghost of old John Silver, I suspect, smokes an occasional pipe in this old place. And many times are the times I saw the thin shade of young Jim Hawkins come out. Take the Labrador cod for export to the Mediterranean lands or to Puerto Rico via New York. Take herring brought to this port of Iceland, Holland, and Scotland; mackerel of Ireland, Magdalen Islands, and Cape Breton; crab of Japan; fish balls of Scandinavia; sardines of Norway and France; caviar of Russia; shrimp coming from Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, or Alaska salmon, and Puget Sound, and the Columbia River."
"Have you heard about the World Wide Web? No? Whatever. Now, have you heard about the Internet? Yes? Great! But what is the Internet? Did you say ""I'm not sure, but I know it has something to do with computers""? You're right - it's true. But that's not all the answer. What's the GENERAL answer then? Hmmm. We need an EXPERT to answer. And guess what - I just know the person! It's usually to find it near a computer, so let's go straight to the computer now. Hi Nettikutti! Here's a group of kids to meet you! Come out, get out, wherever you are!"
"Our attention was drawn to the fact that there was ""practicing"" in progress, and we could, at 8:07, see rapid flashes. That these flashes were pointing directly to Scarborough we did not understand for a few minutes. Then, the slowly rising fog, we saw a fog which was partly smoke. The castle grew up in its place in the distance of six miles. It seemed for a moment that the eight-foot thick Norman walls were extinguishing; but no, no, no matter what was behind the dungeon. Curiously, we could hardly hear the guns, because the wind was alive in the opposite direction, but we could, as the minutes flowed and the air cleared, see distinctly the flashes of the boats and flashes in the city. After about fifteen minutes there was a cessation, or perhaps a hesitation, which lasted two minutes; then the flashes continued."
"Grandma comes to visit. And she always brings peanuts, wild fruits or flours and a melon, sometimes. Thabo wants to give something special to Grandma too. A book would be beautiful, but Grandma can read? If he went to the mall, would he get something nice? ""Let's make him a bag,"" said Thabo with a smile. ""A big bag strong in denim blue."" Mother pulls out the fabric they bought from the shop. She extends the pattern and begins to cut. First, the two main sides that are large and wide. Then two smaller to give him a certain shape. Thabo folds them with both main sides. He looks as Mother repeats the pattern. She cuts the bottom into two long pieces. That's what will make the bag really strong. Thabo folds them as Mother resumes the pattern. She cuts four straps that are broad and long. Two will be sewn together to make a strap."
"It is not surprising that the German Chancellor is anxious to explain his historic sentence about a treaty that is only a ""paper scoop."" ""The sentence made a profound impression because the progress of the world depends to a large extent on the sanctity of agreements between individuals and nations, and the policy set out in Mr von Bethmann-Hollweg's phrase tends to devalue the legal and moral currency of civilization.""What the German Chancellor said was that Britain, by demanding that Germany respect Belgium's neutrality, ""was going to wage a just war for a word, just for a piece of paper,"" that is, that Great Britain was making a mountain from a molehill. He now asks the American public to believe that it wanted to say exactly the opposite of what he said; that it was Britain that really considered Belgium's neutrality as a simple trifle, and that it was Germany that ""takes its responsibilities towards the neutral states so seriously."""
"When Cedric the Saxon saw his son fall into the great tournament of Ashby, his first impulse was to order him to his own servants, but the words suffocated in his throat. He could not bring himself to recognize, in the presence of such an assembly, the son whom he had renounced and disinherited for his allegiance to the Norman king of England, Richard of the Lion's Heart. However, he ordered one of the officers of his house, his cupbearer, to transport Ivanhoe to Ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. But the man was expected in this good office. The crowd was dispersing, indeed, but the wounded knight was nowhere to see. It seemed that the fairies had transported Ivanhoe from the place; and Cedric's officer could have adopted such a theory to account for his disappearance, if he had not suddenly cast his eyes on a person dressed as a shielder, in which he had recognized the characteristics of his fellow serviceman Gurth, who had fled from his master."
"Have you ever heard the word ""sphere""? Do you know what that means? A sphere is normally used when talking about a round form (like a ball). Now, what do we mean when we talk about the biosphere? The prefix ""bio-"" indicates something to do with life. For example, ""biology"" is the study of living organisms. So, can you put these two meanings together to determine what ""biosphere"" means? The biosphere is the place where life exists on planet Earth. When we talk about the biosphere, we talk about a huge system (the whole world!) and how all the different parts work together to support life. We will look at these different parts in more detail later. We can also use the term biosphere in different ways. When we talk about all life on Earth as it interacts with non-living rocks and soil, water and air (atmosphere), we call it the biosphere."
"Our body needs energy to move and work. Where does our energy come from? The energy is obtained from the food we eat and all the other organisms. If you think about the work you have done on fuel and energy in the previous grades in Energy and Change, you will remember that fuels, such as wood, coal and oil, contain potential chemical energy. When this fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen, the potential chemical energy is transferred into light and thermal energy. Similarly, the glucose of the food you eat is combined with oxygen in a series of chemical reactions to release energy. Glucose is broken and energy is released. This energy is then used to drive all the other processes in your body. This process is called breathing."
"For the coloration of Bacillus tuberculosis, the solution is easily and quickly carried out, without danger of precipitation, and can be kept in stock without risk of deterioration. When you want to use it, put about two drops in a glass of watch (a small pot of pomatum is better) full of water and shake gently or stir. There is just a risk of precipitating the colouring material, but the difficulty is easily avoided by a gentle stirring instead of vigorous. After the stain is dissolved in the water, there is no additional problem; if an evaporation occurs by being left too long, it is the water that goes, not the main solvent. The color should now be a light, translucent red, much too diffuse to write the ink."
"It is well known that the distance of the sun has been determined from the speed of light. It has been found, by terrestrial experiments, on the speed of light, and, knowing that from certain astronomical phenomena the light of time requires to pass from the sun to the earth, it has been possible to determine the distance of the sun. There are several methods to determine the speed of light, but until now only two planes have been used to detect the time that light occupies by passing from the sun to the earth. This time was first discovered by observations of Jupiter's satellites. It has been found that the interval between the eclipses of these bodies was not always the same - that eclipses occurred earlier when Jupiter was closest to the earth, and later when he was at his greatest distance. Roemer, a Danish astronomer, first detected the cause of this variation. The second method by which this time was found is the aberration of starlight. This refined method was detected by the great English astronomer Bradley."
"We are approaching a crisis on a daily basis. The government has not ruled out its warlike attitude and threatens not only Greece, but also Russia and the Triple Agreement, while, on the other hand, it has not succeeded in securing Romanian or Bulgarian cooperation in its militant policy. At the same time, the Gate has learned that efforts are being made in the Balkans for joint action against Turkey. It has also become known that the governments of London and Petrograd have agreed to compensate Bulgaria by giving it Adrianople and Thrace, while Greece must have Smyrna, with a considerable hinterland. During this period, the Turkish press has maintained an active campaign against England and the Allies. The following excerpt from an editorial article published in the Terdjumani-Hakkikat characterizes the situation: everyone knows that the Balkan states are going through a period of doubt, and that the warring parties are doing their best to obtain the sympathy and assistance of the Balkan states."
"I have the honour to hand over to your Majesty the letters which His Majesty, my august sovereign, has deigned to confirm my status as Extraordinary Envoy and Plenipotentiary Minister to your Majesty, a mission which I had already had the honour of fulfilling under the glorious reign of Grand King Carol I, founder of the Romanian dynasty. I have witnessed the most brilliant period in the history of the new Greece, during which your Majesty, at the head of his government, succeeded, through his military talents, in realizing the great achievements of ancient Greece, whose majestic relics still serve as an inimitable example to all mankind. Your Majesty's military effort was crowned by the Treaty of Bucharest, which was a joint pacifist work of Greece and Romania, and which was so instrumental in strengthening the bonds of friendship and interests which so readily unite the two peoples."
"Dear Mr. Morse: It was very pleasant for me to get a letter from you the other day. Perhaps I should have found it more pleasant if I had been able to decipher it. I don't think I could master anything beyond the date (which I knew) and the signature (to which I guessed). There is a singular and perpetual charm in your letter – it never ages; it never loses its novelty. You can say to yourself every morning: ""There is this letter from Morse. I haven't read it yet. I think I'm going to take another shy one today, and maybe I'll be able, over the course of a few days, to do what it means by those who look like w, and those I don't have any eyebrows."" Other letters are read, and thrown, and forgotten; but yours are kept forever—inlued. One of them will last a reasonable life. Admiringly yours."
"At 4:15 a.m., there was a ""simultaneously"" attack by the British and German destroyers that gave rise to a lively battle, but no damage to any of the ships in the capital. However, the possibilities of such torpedo attacks were so obvious, here and later in the battle, that the destroyer immediately attained greater value as an auxiliary to the combat ship. It should also be noted that the German submarines were reported at this stage, but they did nothing against the screened combat ships. A British plane had been sent from a mother ship just before the engagement, although Admiral Beatty reported that he had been forced to fly low because of the clouds, and had a difficult task ""to identify four light enemy cruisers."" There was apparently no chance of a broad observation that would have warned Admiral Beatty of the approach of the German high seas fleet."
"The women went away... And now, with water from the stream, King Odyssey washed his clean skin from the salt that clinged to his back and broad shoulders, and wiped from his head the foam brought by the barren sea; and when he had completely bathed and oiled himself, and had put on the clothes that the chaste girl had given him, Athena, daughter of Zeus, made him taller than before and more robust to see him, and she dropped the curling locks around his head as on the flower of jacinthe. As when a man laid gold on silver, a skillful man whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athene had trained in every art, and he fashioned a graceful work; so she cast a grace on her head and shoulders."
"The Empress had lost her expensive diadem, and he could not find it. They searched for her in all directions, but all this in vain. Half distracted, for the misadventure had no good for her or her house, the Empress intensified her efforts to regain her precious possession, but without result. As a last resource, she was proclaimed in the public streets: ""The Empress lost a precious tiara. He who restores her in thirty days will receive a princely reward; but he who delays her, and brings her after thirty days, will lose his head."" At those times, all nationalities flock to Rome; all classes and beliefs can meet in his majestic halls and crowded streets. Among the others, there was a rabbi, a sage of the East, who loved goodness, and lived a just life in the turmoil and turmoil of the Western world."
"Imagine that you are inside a sunny day. A ray of sun through a window illuminates a section of the ground. How would you draw this ray of sun? You could draw a series of parallel lines showing the path of sunlight from the window to the ground. It's not exactly right — no matter how much you look at it, you won't find unique lines of light in the ray of sun! However, it's a good way to draw light and geometrically model light. We call these narrow and imaginary lines of light rays. Remember that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a ray of light like the path of a point on the ridge of a wave. We can use light rays to model the behaviour of light in relation to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes and prisms. Studying how light interacts with materials is called optical."
"When a whaler ship is placed in the ice of Davis Strait, there is little work for its second engineer, once the engines have been well calmed down. Now, I am not a man who can sit in its berth of mooring and laser. If I don't have a job to do, I'm getting an idea of my house in Ballindrochater and the ministry, that my father had wanted me to trim, and what an idiot I made of myself, and that's depressing. I wasn't already too popular on the Gleaner because of some of the prophecies that I had made angry, which had unfortunately been fulfilled. The crew, and the captain, too, had come to fear my prophetic powers. Finally, I thought that I was sports on the ice. There was head money offered for all bears, foxes, seals, muskoxes, and as it was shot down and gathered."
"In the city of Durdlebury, Doggie Trevor began to feel appreciated. He was able to play the piano, harp, viola, flute and clarionette, and sing a soft tenor. In addition to the music, Doggie had other achievements. He was able to choose the exact shade of silk for a living room sofa cushion, and he had an excellent gift for the selection of wedding gifts. In all, Marmaduke Trevor was a young gentleman of exquisite taste. After the breakfast of a certain July morning, Doggie, dressed in a green silk-dressing-gown, entered his own particular room and sat down to think. In his way it was a very beautiful room - high, spacious, well proportioned, facing the southeast. The wall paper, which Doggie had designed himself, was ivory white, with peacock blue trimmings."
"The main falsity that pushes the electromanics of the time to their ruinous investments is the idea that the electromotors are new, and that electric lighting is in its infancy; while gas lighting is considered an old, or mature medium-aged enterprise, and therefore we have to expect a wonderful growth of the child and no other progress of the adult. These excited speculators do not seem to be aware that electric lighting is older than gas lighting; that Sir Humphry Davy exposed electric light on Albemarle Street, while London was still weakly lit by oil lamps, and long before gas lighting was attempted anywhere. Sir Humphry Davy's lamp used at the Royal Institution, at the beginning of the present century, was an arrangement of two carbon pencils, between which was formed the ""electric arc"" by the intense incandescence and burning of carbon particles passing between the solid carbon electrodes."
"Let us look at another example in a different branch of science. Whatever our modern discovery, we can consider the most surprising and important, there is no doubt that the most beautiful is that of the spectroscope. It allowed us to do what, a few years before its introduction, was taken for the very type of the impossible, namely, to study the chemical composition of the stars; and it gives us every day a clearer and clearer overview of the state of the great luminaire that forms the center of our system. However, even if such beautiful and interesting results may be, one might well think that they could never have practical application, and that the spectroscope would remain at least an instrument of science, but of science alone. However, this is not the case."
"But she didn't fall off the horse, she wasn't fast either. A year or two ago, she went like the wind. But this habit was broken, and she used the horse to open up to get some fresh and hard exercise, and to work a certain amount of energy that flourished in her and needed a physical exit. This need was in her heart for years. It was back from the impulse that kept the little unshakeable and brown figure on the streets and country roads of this community and built in a strong muscular body what had been a fragile and sick frame during the first years of her life. But riding gave her more than a body. He liberated a robust soul. She was the happiest thing in the world. And she was happy because she was expanding her horizon. She came to know all kinds and conditions of men; Charley O'Brien, the traffic cop, was one of her best friends. W. L. Holtz, another Latin teacher, was."
"If he is a good-hearted boy, as I think he will, the first thing he will do, before inspecting the contents of the basket, or cutting them off with the knife that Master Brown so consciously lent to him, will be to read the letter of the house that is on the top of the package. He does it, as I noticed to Miss Raby (for whom I was fixing pens when the little circumstance arose), with a puffed face and wink eyes. Look how the other boys look in the basket as he says – I say to him, ""Isn't this a beautiful image?"" A part of the letter is in a very large hand. It's from her little sister. And I would bet she touched the little bag that he just removed, and that Master Lynx looks at."
"The termites are blind, and without the ants they could not reach the plants and quench their thirst. The amber ants protect the termites of the coccinelles that surround them throughout the pasture. The termites wings are short and they cannot fly and escape from the coccinelles when the coccinelles attack. That is why the termites are so grateful for the ants, day and night. The ants are also responsible for the eggs of the termites. The ants carry them for the termites and hide them underground. When the eggs hatch, they lead them to feed on the roots of the juicy plants. That is why the termites are so grateful for the ants, day and night. One day, while the ants carried the eggs underground, one of the eggs fell and rolled, far and far. The ants did not notice the missing egg and went along their way. The egg ended on a small leaf and hatched after a few days."
"Just as wild beasts are the main shepherds of the Serengeti, Calanus are the great shepherds of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, feeding on aquatic meadows of phytoplankton, microscopic algae of plant type that bloom in the spring. Calanus filters the chlorophyll-rich phytoplankton out of sea water using rapid movements of their feathered mouth parts and their sense of touch. Calanus bodies are transparent, which can explain why the famous Norwegian bishop and scientist Johan Ernst Gunnerus of the eighteenth century named them according to philosopher Kalanos (Calananus), who refused to wear clothes! For an apparently ""simple"" animal, Calanus has a complicated life cycle. The cycle begins in spring when adult females release lots of 50 or more eggs into the water."
"The absolute monarchy or despotic monarchy is a monarchy form of government in which the monarch has absolute power among his people. An absolute monarchy exercises unlimited political power over the sovereign state and its people. Absolute monarchies are often inherited but other means of transmission of power are attested. The absolute monarchy differs from the constitutional monarchy, in which the authority of a monarch in a constitutional monarchy is legally limited or limited by a constitution. In theory, the absolute monarch exercises total power over the earth, but in practice the monarchy is counterbalanced by political groups of the social classes and castes of the kingdom, such as the aristocracy, the clergy and the middle and lower classes."
"In theory, absolute zero is the temperature at which the particles of matter (molecules and atoms) are at their lowest points of energy. It is a common misconception that at absolute zero particles lose all energy and stop moving. This, however, is false. In quantum physics, there is something called zero point of energy, which means that even after all the energy that can be extrapolated from particles is extrapolated, particles still have some energy. This is due to the principle of uncertainty of Heisenberg, which affirms that the more you know about the position of particles, the less you know about its momentum, and vice versa. Therefore, you cannot have a particle that is stopped, because you know then its exact position and its momentum. In practice, it is impossible, because, like reaching the speed of light, the amount of energy required is too great. Some have created temperatures very close to absolute zero: the record temperature was 100 pK (cent picokelvin, equal to 10-10 kelvin) above absolute zero."
"An abyssal plain is an underwater plain on the deep bottom of the ocean, usually found at depths ranging from 3,000 metres (9,800 feet) to 6,000 metres (20,000 feet). In general, between the foot of a continental ascent and a mid-ocean ridge, the abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the Earth's surface. They are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored regions of the Earth. Abyssal plains are key geological elements of ocean basins (other elements being a ridge of the middle of the high ocean and flanked abyssal hills)."
"Acceleration is a measure of the speed that changes. Acceleration is the change of speed divided by the change of time. Acceleration is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction. An object was moving north at 10 meters per second. The object is now accelerating and moving north at 15 meters per second. The object is accelerating. An apple falls. It begins to fall at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple moves at 9.8 meters per second. The apple accelerates. At the end of the second second, the apple descends at 19.6 meters per second. The apple accelerates again. Jane is walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Jane's speed does not change. Jane's acceleration is zero. Tom is walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom is turning and walking south at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a non-zero acceleration. Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally is slowing down. After, Sally has had no acceleration."
"An acid is a substance that can give a hydrogen ion (H+) (usually a proton) to another substance. Acids have a pH of less than 7.0. A chemical can give a proton if the hydrogen atom is attached to a negative electron atom such as oxygen, nitrogen or chlorine. Some acids are strong and others weak. Low acids are maintained on some of their protons, while strong acids are allowed to go on. All acids release hydrogen ions in solutions. The amount of ions released per molecule will determine whether the acid is weak or strong. Low acids are acids that partially release hydrogen atoms that are attached. These acids can then decrease pH by dissociation from hydrogen ions, but not completely. Low acids generally have a pH value of 4-6 while strong acids have a pH value of 1-3. A base is a ""opposed chemical"" of an acid."
"A noise cancellation speaker emits a sound wave with the same amplitude but with an inverted phase (also known as the antiphase) to the original sound. The waves combine to form a new wave, in a process called interference, and effectively cancel each other - an effect called destructive interference. Modern active noise control is usually achieved by the use of analog circuits or digital signal processing. Adaptive algorithms are designed to analyze the waveform of background or non-background noise, then based on the specific algorithm generates a signal that will either change phase or reverse the polarity of the original signal. This reverse signal (antiphase) is then amplified and a transducer creates a sound wave directly proportional to the amplitude of the original wave, thus creating destructive interference."
"Aerodynamics is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these areas. The term aerodynamics is often used as a synonym for gas dynamics, the difference being that ""gas dynamics"" applies to the study of the movement of all gases, not limited to air. The formal study of aerodynamics in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier. Most of the first aerodynamic efforts were made to obtain a heavier flight than air, which was first demonstrated by Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1903. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel testing and computer simulations have provided the scientific basis for developments in flight that are heavier than air and a number of other technologies."
"While running to Fred's shop, Walugo remembered the tail and crunchy fried fins. And his eyes, so sweet and tasty! Finally, Walugo chose his three fish. Fred added a fourth fish, but he was tiny. On the way home, Walugo stopped to eat the little fish. He ate slowly, including all the soft bones. It was delicious. He began to think about the three fish in his bag. Three fishes with crunchy fins and tails. When Walugo finally arrived home, his angry mother asked, ""Where have you been all this time?"" She opened the bag and looked inside. ""What happened here?"" She asked."
"Many of the founding fathers of the United States believed that the ideas of the Enlightenment were very important to them. For example, the idea that a government had a mission to benefit all the peoples of a country not only the people in power was very important to them. They made this idea of a government ""for the people"" one of the most important elements of the new Constitution of the United States and of the new American government that they created. The ideas of the Enlightenment were also important to the people who fought in the French Revolution of 1789. In some countries, kings and queens took some of the ideas of the Enlightenment and made changes to their governments. However, they retained power for themselves. These kings and queens were called ""lighted despots""."
"John Locke, one of the most influential thinkers of the Enlightenment, founded his philosophy of governance in the theory of social contracts, a subject that permeated the political thinking of the Enlightenment. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes inaugurated this new debate with his work Leviathan in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the foundations of European liberal thought: the law of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial nature of the political order (which led to the subsequent distinction between civil society and the state); the opinion that any legitimate political power must be ""representative"" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of the law that leaves people the freedom to do anything that the law does not explicitly prohibit."
"The Agora (agorá) was a central public space in the ancient Greek city states. It is the best representation of the response of the city form to accommodate the social and political order of the polish. The literal meaning of the word is ""place of assembly"" or ""assembly"". The Agora was the center of sports, artistic, spiritual and political life in the city. The ancient Agora of Athens is the best known example. At the beginning of Greek history (10th-8th centuries BC), free born citizens would gather in the Agora for a military duty or to hear the statements of the king or the council in power. Later, the Agora also served as a market, where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods in the midst of colonnades."
"Executive functions are thinking skills that allow us to achieve our goals. For example, executive functions allow you to stay on the job, to plan, to keep thoughts, to solve problems and to refrain from acting inappropriately (such as speaking to a teacher). In patients who had had BIT more than 4 years ago, we studied an executive function called working memory T, which is the mental workspace that contains information for immediate use. For example, remembering the numbers that the teacher writes on the table when you note the problem in your notebook. Working memory differs from what is called long-term memory, which is what we use to remember events over the years. For example, working memory helps us add to our heads, long-term memory is what allows us to remember our first day at school."
"The American Civil War (1861–65) is a civil war in the United States of America. It is sometimes called ""war between states."" Eleven states of the South in which slavery was legal wanted to leave the United States of America. They formed the Confederate States of America, also known as ""Confederation."" They wanted the Confederate States of America to be their own country, separate and independent from the United States. Jefferson Davis was chosen as President of the Confederation. The American government and the remaining states were called the Union. The Union is sometimes called ""the North""."
"The Anaconda plan is the name applied to a strategy to suppress Confederation at the beginning of the American Civil War. Proposed by Chief General Winfield Scott, the plan focused on the blockade of the southern ports, and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the south in half. Because the blockade would be rather passive, it was largely derided by the vociferous faction that wanted a more vigorous pursuit of the war, and that compared it to the reels of an anaconda suffocating its victim. The image of snake taken on, giving its popular name. In the first days of the civil war, the strategy proposed by Chief General Winfield Scott for the war against the south had two main features: first, all ports in the escrow states had to be strictly blocked; second, a strong column of perhaps 80,000 men should use the Mississippi River as a highway to push completely through Confederation."
"Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world, from the order of the 9th century B.C.E. to the 6th century B.C.E.. It is often divided into the archaic period (from the 9th to the 6th century B.C.E.), the classical period (from the 5th and 4th century B.C.E.) and the Hellenistic period (from the 3rd century B.C.E. to the 6th century B.C.E.). It is antecedented to the second millennium B.C.E. by the Mycenian Greek. The language of the Hellenistic phase is known as Koine (common). Koine is considered a historical step distinct from its own, although in its oldest form it closely resembles the attic Greek and in its last form it approaches the medieval Greek. Before the Koine period, the Greek of the classical and earlier periods included several regional dialects."
"The Andromeda galaxy is the spiral galaxy closest to the Milky Way, our galaxy. Andromeda is sometimes called M31 or NGC 324 by astronomers. It is about 2.6 million light years away from us. Andromeda is the largest galaxy in the Local Group, which consists of the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, the Triangulum galaxy and about 30 other smaller galaxies. Although the largest, Andromeda may not be the largest. Recent results suggest that the Milky Way contains more black matter and may be the largest in the grouping. The 2006 observations of the Spitzer Space Telescope have revealed that M31 contains a trillion stars (1012). This is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy, which is estimated at about 200-400 billion. Andromeda is estimated at 7.1×1011 solar masses. In comparison, a 2009 study estimates that the Milky Way and Andromeda are about equal in mass, while a 2006 study estimates that the Milky Way is about the same in mass."
"The sunbirds like Loten and Lily live in parts of India and Sri Lanka. They are as long as a note of 100 rupees and weigh as much as a piece of ten rupees. Loten and Lily have curved beaks and tube-shaped tongues to collect the nectar from the flowers. When Loten and Lily were babies, they had short and broad beaks so that their parents could feed them easily. Their parents digested the food a little in their stomach before giving it to them. When they grew up strong enough, Loten and Lily learned to fly. They also had to learn to find their own food. Loten and Lily receive energy from what they eat and drink. This energy allows them to use their muscles to fly. Unlike us humans, Loten and Lily cannot store much energy in their body as fat. They must stay very light. Otherwise, they will not be able to fly."
"In most democracies, parliamentary approval is necessary for the government to spend money. In a Westminster parliamentary system, the defeat of a supply bill in a parliamentary vote usually requires the resignation of a government or the convening of general elections. One of the most famous examples of the defeat of a supply bill was the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when the Senate, which was controlled by the opposition, refused to approve a package of credit and loan bills, which prompted Governor General Sir John Kerr to reject Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and appoint Malcolm Fraser as the custodial prime minister until the next election (where the Fraser government was elected)."
"A major step forward in pacemaker function was to try to mimic nature by using various inputs to produce a speed stimulator using parameters such as QT, pO2 – pCO2 (dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide levels) in the arterial-venous system, physical activity as determined by an accelerometer, body temperature, ATP levels, adrenaline, etc. Instead of producing a static, predetermined heart rate, or intermittent control, such a rhythm stimulator, a ""Dynamic Pacemaker"", could compensate for both the actual and potentially anticipated respiratory load. The first dynamic stimulator was invented by Anthony Rickards of the National Heart Hospital, London, United Kingdom, in 1982. Many advances were made to improve the control of the pacemaker once implanted."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exposed by machines. In computing, an ideal ""intelligent"" machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes measures that maximize its chances of success to a certain objective. Collectively, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is applied when a machine mimics ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"". As machines become increasingly capable, installations once one thinks that one needs intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer seen as an example of ""artificial intelligence"" which has become a routine technology."
"Artificial muscle is a generic term used to refer to materials or devices that can contract, extend or rotate reversibleally within a component due to external stimulus (such as voltage, current, pressure, or temperature).The three basic responses to actuation – contraction, expansion, and rotation – can be combined within a single component to produce other types of movement (e.g. bending, contracting one side of the material while expanding the other side). Conventional motors and linear or rotary pneumatic actuators are not considered artificial muscles, because there is more than one component involved in actuation."
"Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that reproduces the natural process of photosynthesis, a process that converts sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The term, artificial photosynthesis, is commonly used to refer to any system of capturing and storing energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a solar fuel). Photocatalytic fractionation of water converts water to hydrogen ions and oxygen, and is a primary research field in artificial photosynthesis."
"The Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylon, was influenced by the Sumero-Akkadian styles (and to a certain degree Mitanni), but developed its own distinctive style early on. The palaces were decorated with colourful wall decorations, and the seal cup (an art learned from Mittani) developed a rhythm. The schools of scribes taught the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, and the Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavor. The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing articles.From the 13th to the 10th century, the story of images appeared as a new form of art: a continuous series of images carved on square steles."
"Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner solar system. The largest were also called planetoids. These terms have been historically applied to any astronomical object in orbit around the Sun that has not shown the disk of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer solar system have been discovered and found volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they have often been distinguished from the asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term ""asteroid"" refers to the minor planets of the inner solar system, including those coorbital with Jupiter. There are millions of asteroids, many of which are considered to be the broken remnants of the esomics planets, from the bodies within the solar nebula of the young Sun that have never grown large enough to become planets. The vast majority of known asteroids orbit in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter orbits."
"The galaxies have a variety of morphologies, with irregular, elliptical and disk-like forms, depending on their formation and evolutionary history, including interaction with other galaxies, which can lead to fusion. Disc galaxies include lenticular and spiral galaxies with characteristics such as spiral arms and a distinct halo. In the heart, most galaxies have a supermassive black hole, which can lead to an active galactic nucleus. Disc galaxies can also have satellites in the form of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. The components of a galaxies are formed of gas matter that is assembled by the gravitational self-attraction in a hierarchical manner."
"Astronomy is a natural science. It is the study of everything outside of the Earth's atmosphere. It studies celestial objects (such as stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae) and processes (such as supernovae explosions, gamma ray gusts and cosmic background radiations of microwaves). This includes the physics, chemistry of these objects and processes. A related subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the universe as a whole, and the way in which the universe has changed over time. The astronomical word comes from the Greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law. A person who studies astronomy is called astronomer. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences."
"Astrophysics is the study of how stars and planets work, and how we can learn more about them. Astrophysics use physics to explain what astronomers find and see. Astrophysics is also the study of how the Universe began and how it changes over time. This part of astrophysics is called cosmology. For a long time the bodies in the sky seemed to be immutable spheres moving in a circle. But on the growth and decomposition of the Earth, and the natural movement was in a straight line. Therefore, people thought that the celestial region was made of a material fundamentally different from that found on Earth. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, natural philosophers such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Newton, began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar types of material and were subjected to the same natural laws."
"The augmented reality (AR) is a direct or indirect live view of a physical and real environment whose elements are increased (or supplemented) by sensory inputs generated by computers such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is linked to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is changed (perhaps even diminished rather than increased) by a computer. Therefore, the technology works by improving the current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated reality. The increase is conventional in real time and in a semantic context with environmental elements, such as sports scores on television during correspondence."
"Likhutu was seduced by the aroma of the mandazi. He wanted to buy it. One day, Likhutu went to the woman selling the mandazi. ""Is there something I can do for you to win some mandazi?"" he asked. ""Yes, you can look at my store for me while I go to the group of Chama's women,"" replied the woman While the woman was far away, Likhutu became tempted by the stunning mandazi. He said with taste, ""I'm going to eat as much as I can. And then I'm going to keep it in my hat."" Likhutu had not finished talking when he saw the mandazi woman from afar. He stuffed his hat with the mandazi directly from the boiling oil. Then he pulled the hat on his head. Immediately, Likhutu began to twist the neck of the mandazi."
"The reaction time relative to the ERB is defined as the time it takes for a motorist to react to an external hazard or stimuli and then perform the appropriate reaction, or an evasive manoeuvre such as braking when a vehicle stops at the front. The feedback provided by a HUD is projected on the windshield of a vehicle with the aim of integrating external stimuli and instrumental feedback; thus eliminating the need to remove the eyes of a driver from the road. Studies of hazard response time in HUD vs HDD designs have shown that the average reaction times for HUD are faster. This trend seems to continue through demographic data, including the two categories of experience and age. Speed maintenance is the extent to which a driver maintains a speed and adjusts his speed according to traffic laws and environmental conditions."
"People born during this period are often called baby boomers; however, some experts distinguish between those born during these demographic baby booms and those who identify with the overlapping cultural generations. The causes of the baby booms may involve various factors of fertility. A common baby boom was just after the Second Cold War. The American birth rate exploded after the Second World War. From 1945 to 1961, more than 65 million children were born in the United States. At the height of this baby boom, a child was born every seven seconds. Many factors contributed to the baby boom. First, young couples who had ceased to marry during the Second World War and the Korean War could finally start their families."
"But Mount Erebus is only a mountain. It is a volcano. A volcano is an opening in the surface of the Earth. The melted rock called lava comes out of the opening. When it happens, it is called an eruption. There are volcanoes all over the world. Some of them are very old. They don't erupt anymore. But many volcanoes are still bursting. Mount Erebus is bursting almost every day! Ross Island is a cold place. It is near Antarctica. This means that Mount Erebus is covered with snow and ice all year round. But the interior of the volcano is very hot. The vapor from the inside of the volcano comes out from the sides by cracks in the rock. The steam melts the ice and forms caves made of ice. When the hot steam moves in the cold air, it freezes in the pillars. They look like cicles pointing towards the sky! At the top of the volcano is a lake. But this lake is not made of water."
"You probably know that the wind and the water can shape the earth. But did you know that glaciers can also? Glaciers are made of ice. Ice is strong. But glaciers are so big and heavy that they can flow like a river. Glaciers are found on high mountains. It is cold, so the snow does not melt. Instead, the snow accumulates and assembles, forming ice. For many years, the ice is built and forms a glacier. The glacier becomes so heavy that it moves slowly towards the mountains. The glacier scratches and forms the sides of the mountains. Glaciers are also found in the Arctic and Antarctica. They squeeze and crush the land down as they move. Glaciers have shaped the world in a surprising way. Millions of years ago, glaciers covered the desert of South Africa."
"Imagine that you are standing on the North Pole. What do you see? First of all, you do not see any land. In fact, you are not standing on earth at all, but instead you are on a plate of ice floating on a cold and deep ocean. At the South Pole, you would be on earth, and at the top of a high and flat plateau. So strangely, the background of the world is actually quite high! Bundle up, because even in the summer the North Pole is cold. The average temperature of summer is around 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius). If you decide to go to the South Pole instead, you will be even colder. The average temperature from summer to the South Pole is cold -18 degrees Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius). If you make your trip in summer, another thing you do not see is the night."
"Some species are predators, feed on other insects, snails or even small vertebrates such as snakes and lizards. Field crickets eat a variety of fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants. They eat live or dead insects, locust eggs and puppies of flies, butterflies and butterflies. Sometimes they steal prey from spider webs. Spotted camel crickets come out of humid hot nights to feed themselves. They eat mushrooms, roots, fruits and dead insects, including other locusts. Bush crickets eat leaves, flowers and fruits of living plants. Ant crickets eat ants of young trees. Tree crickets feed on aphids. Snowy tree crickets also eat small insects."
"Some butterflies lay eggs in clothing, others lay them in dry foods, such as flour or rice. When eggs hatch, larvae eat clothes or dry foods. Similarly, larvae have damaged crops, trees and ornamental plants. Have you ever found strange holes in your clothes? They may have been made by a larva of hungry butterflies! Humans use butterflies to keep butterflies out of their clothes. Butterflies balls are round and white balls treated with chemicals that poison butterflies. Since poison can also harm humans, balls should never be tasted or eaten. You should wash your hands immediately after touching butterflies balls."
"At the top of the stomach is a tube where the food comes from the esophagus. When you swallow, this tube opens so that the food can go into the stomach. The stomach is made of muscle. These muscles help to break down the food by masking it into smaller pieces. The muscles also make waves pushing the food further into the digestive path. This is called peristalsis and occurs from the esophagus to the large intestine. The stomach is lined with glands. These special cells make a liquid that is released into the stomach. This liquid is called gastric juice. Gastric juice has acid in it and helps to break down or digest the food. The lower part of the stomach is called the pyloric zone. At the bottom of the stomach is another opening. This leads to the stomach."
The eyes are made of several different parts. The white part of the eye is called the sclera. (It is interesting to note that only in human species among all other creatures that the sclera is visible when the eyes are open). This part covers the surface of the eyes except the forehead itself. At the front of an eye is a cornea. This part acts as a shield for the eye. It can still let the light pass because it is transparent. Under the cornea is the iris and the pupil. The student is the black circle in the middle. It is actually a hole that lets the light pass through the back of the eye. The iris is a colored diaphragm around the student. It is a muscle that opens and closes around the student to allow more or less light to pass. Behind the student is a lens that focuses the light that passes through it on the retina.
"The light of the sun shines on Earth. The light makes our air, our earth and our water warm. But some things get hotter than others. Pretend it's a sunny day. If you were wearing a black shirt, you would feel warm. But if you were wearing a white shirt, you wouldn't feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more energy from the sun. It makes the black shirt warm. The light colors reflect more energy from the sun. It makes the white shirt fresher to wear. See yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you. Fold the black paper to make a pocket. Do the same with white paper. Then put a thermometer in the black pocket. Do the same in the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn on the lamp and wait 10 minutes."
"The lichens are made of two living beings: a fungus and an algae. They live together and help each other. How do these living beings help each other? The algae feed on the air and water. The fungus protects the algae by growing around it. The lichens do not have roots. They do not need soil to grow. They can grow in strange places – on rocks, cliffs and trunks of trees. In the Arctic and Antarctica, the lichens grow on rocks. The lichens grow slowly. They can even grow cold. They can even continue to grow when they are covered with snow! The lichens are hard. If a lichen becomes dry and cold, it could crash and blow in the wind. But the lichens are not dead. When it is warmer or weter, the lichens can start to grow again."
"You've heard of the Arctic? It's a place at the top of the world. Many animals live on the earth and in the water there. One of these animals is the Arctic wolf. It's a snowy white fur wolf. Imagine you're a wolf. What would your life be like? You would live with your mother, father, brothers and sisters in a group. This group is called a pack. Other wolves would live in the pack, too. You'd like to play with your brothers and sisters. This would teach you how to hunt. Your pack would hunt together. You could hunt caribou, rabbits and muskoxen. Your life would be difficult. Hunting is dangerous. You could not be able to find food. Then you would be hungry. You would be cold and hungry during the winter. You would be agitated with other wolves to stay warm. But the summer would be different. There would be a lot of animals to hunt."
"Near the top of the world is the tundra. The tundra is flat and has no trees. It is covered with snow and ice for most of the year. In spring, the snow and ice melt. Under the ground, the soil remains frozen. The ground becomes very sparkling. It is a marsh. The small yellow flowers grow from the cold and wet ground. They are called marigolds of the marshes. The flies hide in the flowers. They absorb the energy of the sun and warm up. The flies fly from flower to flower. They help the flowers to make seeds. The caribou eat the flowers. The caribou also give the plants the nutrients they need to grow. The mother flies lay their eggs in the nose of the caribou. It is hot. Young flies eat and grow. Young flies grow. The young flies grow."
"When you think of dinosaurs and where they lived, what do you imagine? Do you see hot swamps, thick jungles or sunny plains? Dinosaurs lived in these places, yes. But did you know that some dinosaurs lived in the cold and darkness near the poles of the North and the South? These surprised scientists also. Paleontologists believed that dinosaurs lived only in the warmest parts of the world. They thought that dinosaurs could only have lived in places where turtles, crocodiles and snakes live today. Later, these dinosaurs began to find bones in surprising places. One of these surprising fossil beds is a place called Dinosaur Cove, Australia. A hundred million years ago, Australia was connected to Antarctica. The two continents were located near the South Pole. Today, paleontologists dig fossils of dinosaurs out of the ground."
"So what is a solid? Solids are usually hard because their molecules have been packed together. The closer your molecules are, the harder you are. Solids can also hold their own shape. A rock will always look like a rock unless something happens to it. The same goes for a diamond. Even when you grind a solid in a powder, you will see tiny pieces of this solid under a microscope. The liquids will move and fill any container. Solids keep their shape. As a solid holds its shape, atoms inside a solid are not allowed to move too much. It is one of the physical characteristics of solids. Atoms and molecules in liquids and gases bounce and float, free to move where they want. The molecules in a solid are stuck. Atoms always rotate and electrons are still flying, but the whole atom will not change their position."
"The second state of matter that we are going to discuss is a liquid. Solids are hard things that you can remember. Gases float around you and in bubbles. What is a liquid? Water is a liquid. Your blood is a liquid. Liquids are a state between materials. They can be found between solid states and gas. They must not be made of the same compounds. If you have a variety of materials in a liquid, it is called a solution. A characteristic of a liquid is that it will fill the shape of a container. If you pour water into a cup, it will fill the bottom of the cup first and then fill the rest. The water will also take the shape of the cup. It will fill the bottom first because of the gravity. The upper part of a liquid will usually have a flat surface. This flat surface is also due to the gravity. Put a cube of ice (solid) in a cup will leave you with a cube in the middle of the cup; the shape will not change until the ice becomes liquid."
"Solids are shapes that you can actually touch. They have three dimensions, which means length, width and height. These shapes are what make up our daily life, and are very useful. The dots on a solid must not be coplanar or colinear. The edge of solids are called the edge, and the surfaces are called the faces. The corners, like angles and plane figures, are called vertices. A solid with only the straight edges is called a polyhedron (pol-ee-HEE-dron). The plural form of polehedron is polyhedron (pol-ee-HEE-drah). Your chocolate bars are polyhedron, The Great Pyramids are polyhedron – many things are. We go in detail on them later."
"Animals are made of many cells, they eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move. Only animals have the brain (although not all animals do; jellyfish, for example, have no brains). Animals are found everywhere on earth. They dig into the ground, swim in the oceans and fly into the sky. Humans are a type of animal. Dogs, cats, cows, horses, frogs, fish, etc. Animals can be divided into two main groups, vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates can be divided into mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians. Invertebrates can be divided into arthropods (such as insects, spiders and crabs), molluscs, sponges, several different types of worms, jellyfish — and a few other subgroups."
